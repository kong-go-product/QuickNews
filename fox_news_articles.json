      "description": "Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel&apos;s show &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; returned Tuesday night after being suspended for nearly a week following his controversial comments.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>\"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" host Jimmy Kimmel insisted that he never intended to make light of Charlie Kirk's assassination in comments that led to his show's suspension.</p><p>Tuesday night was the first show Kimmel hosted since Disney announced its return on Monday after nearly a week off the air.</p><p>Kimmel came out to a standing ovation which continued into chants of \"Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!\" and ongoing cheering.</p><p>\"If you are just joining us, we are preempting your regularly scheduled encore episode of 'Celebrity Family Feud,' we’re bringing you this special report,\" Kimmel opened. \"I’m happy to be here with you tonight.\" </p><p>He went on to thank his fellow late-night talk show hosts, including Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart and David Letterman, along with right-leaning critics like Clay Travis and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for showing some support for him during his suspension.</p><p>Kimmel then addressed, though did not apologize for, the comments that originally got him suspended.</p><p>\"I’ve been hearing a lot about what I need to say and do tonight, and the truth is, I don’t think what I have to say is going to make much of a difference,\" Kimmel said. \"If you like me, you like me. If you don’t, you don’t. I have no illusions about changing anyone’s mind. But I want to make something clear, because it’s important to me as a human, and that is – you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man.\"</p><p>Kimmel began tearing up as he said he posted a message to Instagram sending love to Kirk's family the day of his death.</p><p>\"Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions,\" he continued. \"It was a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make, but I understand that, to some, it felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both, and for those who think I did point a finger, I get why you’re upset. If the situation was reversed, there’s a good chance I would have felt the same way.\" </p><p>Kimmel added, \"I have many friends and family members on the other side who I love and remain close to, even though we don’t agree on politics at all. I don’t think the murderer who shot Charlie Kirk represents anyone. This was a sick person who believed violence was a solution, and it isn’t ever.\"</p><p>Kimmel also gave his mixed thoughts on Disney suspending his show after 23 years on the air.</p><p>\"Every night, they defended my right to poke fun at our leaders and to advocate for subjects that I think are important by allowing me to use their platform, and I'm very grateful for that. With that said, I was not happy when they pulled me off the air on Wednesday,\" Kimmel said.</p><p>He added, \"I did not agree with that decision and I told them that, and we had many conversations. I shared my point of view, they shared theirs. We talked it through. And at the end, even though they didn’t have to, they really didn’t have to, this is a giant company, we have short attention spans, and I am a tiny part of the Disney corporation, they welcomed me back on the air.\"</p><p>Kimmel closed his monologue by tearfully recounting Erica Kirk's speech at her husband's funeral where she showed forgiveness to his assassin.</p><p>\"There was a moment over the weekend, a very beautiful moment. I don’t know if you saw this. On Sunday, Erika Kirk forgave the man who shot her husband. She forgave him. That is an example we should follow. If you believe in the teachings of Jesus, as I do, there it was. That’s it. A selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow. It touched me deeply, and I hope it touches many, and if there’s anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, I hope it can be that,\" Kimmel said.</p><p>Kimmel’s show was suspended by Disney last Wednesday after he said right-wing commentators were \"desperately\" trying to characterize Kirk’s alleged assassin as someone who wasn’t \"MAGA.\"</p><p>\"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\" Kimmel said on Sept. 15.</p><p>Broadcasting companies Sinclair Broadcasting Group and Nexstar Media Group announced after the episode aired that they would be preempting the show across dozens of ABC affiliates because of Kimmel’s \"ill-timed and insensitive\" comments. </p><p>Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr also made a veiled threat against the show following backlash from the comments.</p><p>Sinclair and Nexstar preempted Kimmel’s show again Tuesday night and have said they will keep doing so as discussions with ABC continue behind the scenes.</p><p>Ahead of Kimmel's return, President Donald Trump attacked both Kimmel and ABC for bringing the show back despite being told that it was \"canceled.\"</p><p>\"I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent’ was never there. Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who’s not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p><p>He continued, \"He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.\"</p></body></div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva has won a special election in battleground Arizona, securing the congressional seat left vacant by her father’s death and further eroding Republicans’ razor-thin House majority.</p><p>The Associated Press reports that Grijalva, a former Pima County supervisor, defeated business owner and contractor Daniel Butierez, the Republican nominee, in Tuesday's election in southern Arizona's 7th Congressional District.</p><p>Grijalva will serve the remaining 15 months of the term of Raul Grijalva, who died in March following complications from cancer treatment.</p><p>The younger Grijalva's victory was anything but a surprise in the left-leaning district. Democrats enjoy a nearly two-to-one voter registration advantage over Republicans in the Hispanic-majority district, which stretches from Yuma to Tucson and includes almost the entire length of the state's border with Mexico.</p><p>Republicans currently control the House 219-214, with two vacant seats remaining. </p><p>Besides Arizona's 7th Congressional District, there's also a vacancy in Texas 18th Congressional District, a heavily Democrat-dominated district in Houston, following the March death of Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner. The special election to fill the seat will be held on November 4, which is Election Day 2025.</p><p>Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, a right-leaning seat where Republican Rep. Mark Green stepped down in July to take a job in the private sector, is also currently vacant. The special election to fill the seat will be held on December 2.</p><p>Grijalva, thanks in part to her family name and her support from national progressive rock stars, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, grabbed over 60% of the primary vote this summer in a five-candidate showdown.</p><p>Progressive activist and social media influencer Deja Foxx came in a distant second.</p><p>Grijalva, who with her victory became Arizona's first Latina in Congress, targeted President Donald Trump as she campaigned,</p><p>\"In Congress, I commit to fight Trump’s cruel agenda, like the Big Ugly Bill that took away coverage from nearly 383,000 Arizonans and 142,000 children,\" Grijalva pledged in a social media post, as she took aim at Trump, congressional Republicans, and their sweeping domestic policy measure that they named the One Big Beautiful Bill.</p><p>Grijalva had also said that if she won, she would immediately sign a discharge petition by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky. The petition, which is currently just one vote shy of passing, calls on the GOP-controlled House to vote to urge the Justice Department to release the files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>Butierez, as he campaigned, had been promoting himself as the change candidate in a district controlled by Democrats since the seat was created over two decades ago.</p><p>\"This is your chance to actually get a Representative who will represent everyone. If you vote we win, if you don't only the radicals will have representation,\" he wrote on X.</p><p>Butierez, who as the 2024 GOP congressional nominee lost to the elder Grijalva while Trump narrowly carried the southwestern battleground state at the top of the ballot, easily won this summer's Republican primary in the special election.</p><p>While Trump carried Arizona last year after losing it in 2020, 2024 Democratic presidential nominee and then-Vice President Kamala Harris won the district by 23 points. </p><p>Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin, in a statement after the race was called, said that \"Rep.-elect Grijalva won a hard-fought race. Now, Arizonans will have a fighter in their corner who will stand up to Trump on behalf of families who want to see real leadership in Washington.\"</p></body></div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>A scary scene unfolded at Progressive Field during the Cleveland Guardians-Detroit Tigers game Tuesday night, when the Guardians’ David Fry was hit in the face by a foul tip on a bunt attempt. </p><p>In the bottom of the sixth inning with the Guardians down 2-1, there were runners on the corners with no outs when Tarik Skubal delivered a 2-1 pitch to Fry, who quickly turned to square for a sacrifice bunt. </p><p>But the 99 mph fastball from Skubal, the Tigers' Ace, was too far inside. As Fry made contact with the pitch, it hit the top of his bat and redirected into his face. </p><p>Fry hit the dirt at home plate in immediate pain, and Skubal threw down his glove and hat in shock. Skubal was in clear discomfort after what unfolded, but everyone on the field and in the stands shared his feelings as trainers rushed out to tend to Fry. </p><p>Fry eventually stood up, and blood was streaming down from his nose. A cart came out to take Fry off the field, and as you’d expect, his night was over. </p><p>Unfortunately for Fry and the Guardians, because the ball made contact with the bat before hitting him in the face, it was considered a foul ball, and the count went to 2-2. </p><p>Pinch hitter George Valera came in for Fry to finish the at-bat and take his place for the remainder of the game. </p><p>The inning ended up getting worse for Skubal and the Tigers once play finally resumed. His first pitch after the accident was wild, allowing the runner at third base to score to tie the game, while Jose Ramirez moved up to second. </p><p>Then Skubal committed a balk, allowing Ramirez a free bag, a groundout to first base scored Ramirez to give Cleveland a 3-2 lead heading into the seventh inning. </p><p>Skubal is one of the best pitchers in MLB, and the 2024 Cy Young Award winner entered the game with an American League-leading 2.23 ERA over 189.1 innings. His resume this season makes him a frontrunner for the award yet again. </p><p>The game has huge playoff implications because the Guardians were just one game behind the Tigers when they began their final three-game, regular-season series Tuesday night. Each game is crucial at this point, with only a handful of games remaining to determine who will vie for a World Series title this October.</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>"

As it turned out, they were early adopters of the feckless posture that would be embraced by a raft of business leaders and institutions once Trump was elected. They’d just been the first in line to grovel,\" Harris wrote after noting the Post's non-endorsement and in reference to President Donald Trump's eventual election victory. </p><p>Harris's new book was released on Tuesday and recounts her historically short presidential campaign that followed former President Joe Biden's decision to exit the race.</p><p>The LA Times announced in late October the editorial board wouldn’t be endorsing a candidate for the first time since 2008.

Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.\"</p><p>Harris also highlighted Alexandra Petri, who now writes for The Atlantic but previously served as a political humor columnist at the Post.</p><p>\"But if I were the paper, I would be a little embarrassed that it has fallen to me, the humor columnist, to make our presidential endorsement.

So, if people are wondering who I am and what I stand for, I’d say that my faith and the many blessings I’ve been given are why I’m able to be here, and I just want to make sure that I can give that back to people, that I can support people around me, that I can love people around me the same way that I’ve been blessed.\"</p><p>The Cubs were among the MLB teams to pay tribute to Kirk, calling for an end to \"all political violence.\" </p><p>The flag at Wrigley Field was flown at half-staff in accordance with MLB’s request that teams follow President Donald Trump’s presidential proclamation honoring Kirk.</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>Comedian Guy Branum claimed he was left with bruises after an alleged altercation with a fellow passenger during a recent flight on Delta Air Lines.</p><p>On Sept. 14, the 49-year-old actor shared a video on Instagram in which he said he was sitting in the middle seat when a man sat down next to him and complained about not having enough space. Branum alleged the man then elbowed him and told him that he was \"too fat\" to fly.</p><p>\"I had an exciting adventure on my plane flight today,\" the \"No Strings Attached\" actor began his video, which he labeled \"Flying While Fat.\"</p><p>\"Normally when I [have] more money, I'll fly business class because I'm a big guy and I don't want to be in anybody else's space,\" he continued. \"And this time, I got a Comfort Plus ticket.\" According to Delta’s website, Comfort+ seats are the same width as standard economy but provide more legroom.</p><p>Branum said he often worried about flying since he has had \"people freak out at me before.\"</p><p>\"And today, it was a middle seat, not great,\" he said. \"A guy came down, a White man in his sixties.</p><p>\"And first, he freaked out at a woman because she was putting something in the overhead compartment near his seat,\" Branum continued. \"Then he sat down next to me, and he immediately was just p----- off at me and asked me if I could move over. And I was like, 'No, I can't.' Then he just elbowed me as hard as he could.\"</p><p>In the video, Branum displayed an image of bruises on his side that he allegedly sustained after the incident. </p><p>\"And then I took this video,\" he said as the clip cut to another video in which he was seen seated on the plane next to the man.</p><p>\"Elbowed me because he believes that I'm too fat to be sitting next to him,\" Branum claimed to the camera as the man remarked, \"Well, who wouldn't believe that?\" </p><p>\"Would you be happy if I elbowed you back?\" Branum asked the man.</p><p>\"Well, there's not a lot of room here for me,\" the man replied. \"I paid for this seat too.\"</p><p>\"I paid for this seat as well,\" Branum pointed out. </p><p>\"Think you'd want to at least share the armrest?\" the man asked. Branum responded, \"Yes, we're not sharing the armrest right now. Right now, you are using the armrest because you elbowed me to get out.\"</p><p>\"I'm not even on the armrest,\" the man said before Branum told him, \"I'm not on the armrest either.\"</p><p>The two continued to argue as the man appeared to imply that Branum should lose weight. After Branum told the man, \"You are hardly svelte yourself,\" the man said he was a member of WeightWatchers.\"</p><p>\"And that is how I lost the weight,\" the man told him. </p><p>Branum then asked the man if he expected him to lose weight in the \"next 20 minutes or so.\"</p><p>\"No, have you ever,\" the man said as Branum interjected, \"Do you think I have ever tried to lose weight, Sir?\" </p><p>\"I don't know,\" the man said.</p><p>\"Do you really think that I'm a fat person in this country, and I've never tried to lose weight?\" Branum asked.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" the man repeated. </p><p>\"OK,\" Branum said. </p><p>The video cut to Branum as he addressed the camera, explaining that he told a flight attendant that the man had \"hit\" him but \"I was OK to stay in the seat if necessary.\" </p><p>Branum claimed the man complained to the airline staff that he was \"too fat.\" </p><p>The comedian said multiple Delta staffers came to observe \"if I was too fat,\" including a senior crew member who told the man that Branum would not be removed. Eventually, the man switched seats with a woman across the aisle, and Delta offered her frequent flyer miles for the inconvenience. Branum said he also requested miles.</p><p>Branum noted that the woman who eventually sat next to him was \"so nice.\" However, he went on to say that \"fat people shouldn't be waiting for some future moment when we'll be worthy of traveling and living our lives.\" </p><p>The Emmy Award winner alleged a staff member asked him to delete his video, but he refused. He said other passengers then backed him up, telling staff the man had been difficult with others on the flight.</p><p>He said the woman who eventually sat beside him was \"so nice,\" but added that \"fat people shouldn’t be waiting for some future moment when we’ll be worthy of traveling and living our lives.\"</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Delta Air Lines for comment.</p><p>In an interview with TMZ on Saturday, Branum said he plans to file a police report and a civil lawsuit against the man. \"You can’t hit somebody because you think they’re fat,\" he told the outlet.</p><p>Branum also alleged that the man was not removed from the flight because of his status as a frequent flyer. He told TMZ he has been in contact with Delta representatives about the issue.</p><p>Fox News Digital has also reached out to representatives for Branum for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>Former San Jose State University women's volleyball assistant coach Melissa Batie-Smoose has filed a lawsuit against the Board of Trustees of the California State University (CSU) system. SJSU is one of 23 California-based schools that are part of the CSU system. </p><p>Batie-Smoose's contract was not renewed when it expired in February, after being suspended from the team in the middle of the season for filing a Title IX complaint over the program's handling of a transgender athlete on its team and a female player who objected to the trans athlete. </p><p>Now, Batie-Smoose is alleging wrongful termination, claiming she \"suffered and continues to suffer lost wages, loss of professional reputation and opportunity, emotional distress, and other damages.\" </p><p>\"Defendant’s actions were willful, intentional, and/or taken with reckless disregard for Plaintiff’s federally protected rights,\" the lawsuit states. </p><p>\"Other coaches who did not oppose the inclusion of a biological male on the women’s volleyball team or who did not advocate for the rights of female athletes, were not subjected to suspension, termination or any discriminatory actions as was Plaintiff.\" </p><p>A spokesperson from San Jose State University responded to the lawsuit. </p><p>\"We are aware of the filing and have no further comment, due to pending litigation,\" the spokesperson told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Batie-Smoose's Title IX complaint against the school, which she filed at the end of last October, first brought to light allegations that the transgender athlete, Blaire Fleming, conspired with an opposing player to have teammate Brooke Slusser spiked in the face during a game. </p><p>Slusser previously joined a lawsuit against the NCAA and filed another against the Mountain West Conference, citing her experience of being made to share changing spaces and hotel rooms with Fleming without being told Fleming's birth sex. </p><p>Batie-Smoose was then suspended at the start of November, while the allegations against Fleming prompted an investigation by the Mountain West into the situation. </p><p>The Mountain West's investigation determined that sufficient evidence could not be found, however, Fox News Digital later reported that the law firm hired to conduct the investigation, Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher (WFG), is the same firm that is representing the Mountain West against Slusser's lawsuit, which also contain the allegations against Fleming of conspiring to have Slusser harmed, as seen in public records obtained by Fox News Digital.</p><p>Slusser also previously told Fox News Digital that she had a conversation with a teammate who was interviewed as part of WFG's investigation. </p><p>\"Based on what I was told, exactly what one of my teammates had seen go on that night — about talking about the scouting report and leaving the net open — was told to those lawyers. So, that should have been sufficient evidence [of the alleged plan by Fleming],\" Slusser told Fox News Digital, adding she wants to see the investigation reopened. </p><p>\"People are telling you this happened, and it's not second-hand information. She sat there and heard the conversation between Blaire and [former Colorado State volleyball player] Malaya [Jones]. So, to me, just from what I know without even having to dig deep into this investigation, there is sufficient evidence, and they were told sufficient evidence.\"</p><p>Fox News Digital cannot independently verify that Slusser’s teammate corroborated the allegations against Fleming when speaking to investigators. </p><p>WFG later deleted a Nov. 27 online press release from its website that announced the legal victory to keep Fleming eligible. The page is still viewable via an online archive. Fox News Digital has asked WFG multiple times why the page was deleted but has not gotten a response. </p><p>Meanwhile, Batie-Smoose previously told Fox News Digital what she recalled during the Oct. 3 game against Colorado State in which Fleming was accused of conspiring with opposing player Malaya Jones to have Slusser spiked in the face. </p><p>\"Close to the end of that set was when [Fleming] overpassed a serve right on top of the net for Malayla to hit toward Brooke Slusser, and then those two were kind of always doing eye contact and making smirks up to that point. But then, when that happened, they both laughed, and [Fleming] said, ‘Thank you,’ and that's when Blaire blew her a kiss,\" Batie-Smoose alleged.</p><p>Weeks after her contract was not renewed in February, Batie-Smoose's home in Scotts Valley, California, was vandalized in a shooting.</p><p>Scotts Valley Police Department Captain Scott Garner previously told Fox News Digital that officers determined that the weapon used was a pellet gun, and was investigated as an act of vandalism. The pellet had been recovered by police. Nobody was harmed and no suspect or motive was determined. </p><p>Batie-Smoose said she previously received hostile emails about her stance on Fleming and trans inclusion in women's sports. She also claimed to have had in-person altercations with individuals in Santa Cruz and Scotts Valley who disagreed with her stance. </p><p>\"People recognize me in the community and I'm in an area that's speaking out and speaking to fight for women's sports, I'm in an area with some crazies and I definitely believe it was a target on me for speaking out,\" she said.</p><p>Meanwhile, SJSU is under an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for its handling of the situation involving Fleming and Slusser. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is slamming the Biden administration, especially former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, for leaving behind an \"unprecedented backlog\" of critical infrastructure safety improvements across the country. </p><p>A spokesperson for Buttigieg, who is a rumored 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, dismissed the DOT’s criticisms as \"nonsense.\" </p><p>This week, Duffy announced that his  department is obligating four grants, totaling $42 million, to improve safety on Florida’s Brightline high speed railway, which runs from Miami to Orlando. According to the department, the grants were announced and touted under Buttigieg’s leadership, but the Biden administration never actually delivered on obligating those funds. </p><p>The DOT said the Trump administration inherited a backlog of over 3,200 grants that were announced but never obligated by Buttigieg-Biden. The department said that this has \"delayed critical investments in communities across the country.\" </p><p>In Florida, the oldest grant now being obligated by the Trump administration was first announced three years ago in 2022. The department said that \"after much fanfare, their administration failed to do any of the work to actually process and deliver these funds to Brightline or project sponsors in Florida.\" </p><p>DOT said these unfulfilled grants were to help install safety fencing, grade crossing upgrades and a trespassing alert system. The grants included $24.9 million for a trespassing and intrusion mitigation project, $15.4 million for a Broward County sealed corridor project, $1.6 million for a trespassing identification and classification system and a $150,000 grant for Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office to support overtime costs for enforcement of pedestrian trespassing at hot spots. </p><p>\"Under Secretary Duffy’s direction, the Department of Transportation is working diligently to accelerate the distribution of these long-overdue funds and address core infrastructure projects,\" said DOT.</p><p>In the statement, Duffy called the unfulfilled safety grants \"the latest consequence of the unprecedented Biden-Buttigieg backlog.\" </p><p>One of the defining moments of Buttigieg’s tenure as transportation secretary involved a major train wreck that released toxic materials in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023. While Buttigieg was criticized for his handling of the crisis, he placed the blame on the Trump administration for reversing a rail regulation because of a law passed by Congress in 2015.  </p><p>\"Their failure to execute on these rail grants – some of which stretch back years — put Brightline’s three million annual passengers and Florida communities in unnecessary danger,\" said Duffy. \"Under President Trump’s leadership, America is building again. We are delivering critical resources in record time to enhance safety on our railways, roads, and bridges.\"</p><p>In response, Chris Meagher, a spokesman for Buttigieg, dismissed the DOT’s criticisms as \"more of the same nonsense we've heard from them in the past.\" </p><p>\"We invested in more projects than any administration in the past, and more than 22,000 projects were completed during Pete's time in office,\" Meagher told Fox News Digital. </p><p>He said that during Buttigieg’s tenure, the DOT announced more than $390 billion of funding for more than 78,000 projects, more than 22,000 of which were completed, including 445 rail projects, over 200,000 miles of roadway repairs and improvements, over 12,300 projects to build, repair and modernize bridges, and other projects. </p><p>He noted that \"some of those projects take time to get done right.\" </p><p>\"As with any change in Administration, it then becomes the job of the incoming Administration to finish the job, which is nothing new,\" said Meagher. \"What is new is that the current officeholder complains about it instead of just getting the job done.\" </p><p>A spokesperson for the Trump DOT, meanwhile, told Fox News Digital that while Buttigieg and Biden \"talked a big game,\" their backlog \"speaks volumes.\" </p><p>\"They didn’t do the hard work to actually get critical infrastructure dollars out the door. Instead, they spent their time wasting billions on DEI programs and worrying about whether the term cockpit was offensive,\" said the spokesperson.</p><p>\"The contrast here couldn’t be more clear,\" the spokesperson went on. \"In less than a year, Secretary Duffy has moved quickly to get clear the backlog and invest in real infrastructure projects like these rail grants. Brightline riders and Florida communities will be safer because of it.\" </p></body></div></body></html>"

What incredible instinct and foresight this person had — A very big moment for JUSTICE IN AMERICA!\"</p><p>Trump, who was in New York City attending Tuesday's United Nations General Assembly when the verdict was announced, told reporters he was \"very appreciative\" of the justice that was given and the way it was handled by the Justice Department.</p><p>\"Everybody involved, along with their team of people, handled it really well, and it was very important,\" he said. \"You can’t let things like that happen. It’s not just about me — it’s about protecting any president, or even any person.\"</p><p>\"You can’t allow that to happen. And so justice was served, and we’ll see what happens,\" he added. \"But I very much appreciate the judge and jury and everybody on that. It was so professionally handled, and it’s a great honor.\"</p><p>Routh, 59, was charged on five federal criminal counts, including attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer, and multiple firearms offenses.</p><p>He faces life in prison.</p></body></div></body></html>"
