<div class="article-title">Army’s nuclear comeback: Sweeping new program aims to break ‘tyranny of fuel’ at bases across the globe</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Army is launching a sweeping new nuclear program to generate power for bases across the globe, particularly in remote or contested locations where fuel might be difficult to obtain, Fox News Digital has learned.</p><p>"Hundreds of millions" of dollars will be funneled into the program known as the Janus Project over the next five years, according to Dr. Jeff Waksman, the Army official leading the effort, to install next-generation commercial microreactors at military sites.</p><p>"Great power conflict is defined by who can move their resources around," Waksman said. Energy demands are only set to increase as modern warfare trends toward drones, directed-energy weapons and artificial intelligence. And as war planners prepare for a potential battlefront in the Indo-Pacific with China, "our ability to move energy around the oceans has never been more challenged," he said.</p><p>"It is an immense challenge in terms of providing 24/7 power. Military bases right now are powered entirely by fossil fuels. It is not possible with current technology to provide 24/7 power with solar, wind, and batteries," Waksman said. "So the only solution to the tyranny of fuel that exists now is nuclear power."</p><p>The new plan follows an executive order President Donald Trump signed earlier this year directing the Department of War to begin operating an Army-regulated nuclear reactor at a U.S. military installation by September 2028.</p><p>The initiative — known as the Janus Program — will be led by the Department of the Army, designated as the executive agent for the mission. Waksman described Janus as a "real hardware program" aimed at delivering tangible energy capacity rather than a policy concept. "There have been a lot of nuclear projects in the past that peaked at the press release," he said. "That is not what this is."</p><p>Under Janus, the Army will partner with the Defense Innovation Unit and the Department of Energy’s national laboratories to oversee the design and testing of commercial microreactors. The reactors will be commercially built and operated, rather than owned by the military. To encourage private investment, the Army will use a milestone-based contracting model inspired by NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program — the same framework that helped launch the commercial space industry by funding companies like SpaceX and Boeing to reach key technical milestones instead of paying for traditional government procurement.</p><p>The Army hopes this flexible model will accelerate development, lower costs, and spur a self-sustaining market for small reactors that could eventually power both military and civilian infrastructure.</p><p>Construction of the first hardware is not expected before 2027, which Waksman called "light speed" for a nuclear program. Early work will focus heavily on materials science and supply chains, which he said remain major bottlenecks.</p><p>"In order to provide components that are viable under the conditions of a nuclear reactor, you need certified suppliers — and there just aren’t enough," he said. "One of our goals is to help consolidate and strengthen the industrial base so multiple companies can use the same qualified suppliers."</p><p>The Army plans to work with multiple vendors, each expected to build at least two reactors — the first serving as a prototype and the second refined through lessons learned.</p><p>Beyond powering domestic installations, officials say Janus will also help solve one of the most pressing logistical challenges in a potential conflict with China: moving energy across vast ocean distances. Waksman cited Guam as an example — an island where more than 90 percent of electricity comes from imported oil delivered by foreign-flagged tankers traveling thousands of miles across contested sea lanes.</p><p>"Having something that can provide power for years at a time without any resupply would be an absolute game-changer," he said.</p><p>For now, the reactors will remain stateside, but Waksman said the technology is being developed with future expeditionary use and commercial spin-offs in mind.</p><p>"The Army doesn’t want to be the only buyer of these reactors," he said. "If we can get industry to the sixth or seventh unit, where they can sell to commercial partners, then we’ve succeeded."</p><p>Nuclear microreactors are smaller, factory-built power systems that use the same basic principles as traditional nuclear plants but at a fraction of the size. Most produce between one and 20 megawatts of electricity — enough to power a small town or a military installation — and can operate for years without refueling.</p><p>Unlike large commercial reactors, which can take a decade to construct, microreactors are designed for rapid deployment. They can be shipped by truck or aircraft and installed on-site within weeks, providing steady, carbon-free power in places where fuel delivery is difficult or dangerous.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Everyday Americans are feeling the pain as the government shutdown drags on</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Let’s be blunt: when our federal government shuts down, it’s not a chess match the rest of us signed up for. Indeed, it's a hit to people’s paychecks, to public safety and the fragile systems that keep communities running, safe and thriving.</p><p>No side looks good when they weaponize the budget. What we should expect from our leaders — regardless of party — is competence, not theatrics.</p><p>For most Americans, the first impressions during a shutdown are practical: airports slow down, food-safety inspections are delayed and entire pay cycles for federal employees and contractors are interrupted. Those are not abstractions. They affect real people — including the air-traffic controllers who keep planes in the sky, the nurses and healthcare workers in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals and the inspectors who make sure your groceries aren’t hazardous.</p><p>This reality reached a boiling point during a recent call-in segment on C-SPAN, a military spouse’s voice cracked as she described trying to purchase medication and food for her two medically fragile children, without her husband’s desperately needed paycheck. House Speaker Mike Johnson, sitting on set, was speechless as this Virginian’s story cut through the talking points and reminded us all that behind every political standoff are real families attempting to pay rent, make car payments, purchase medicine and take care of their children. Her story and voice at this moment is a keen reminder that far too many American families can’t afford Washington’s dysfunction.</p><p>Our federal workers didn’t ask for a political fight; they asked for a government that functions.</p><p>Here is another blunt truth: fiscal responsibility matters. Taxpayers want their dollars used wisely. However, fiscal conservatism isn’t served by withholding paychecks from those who keep our communities safe and healthy. Nor is it served by passing massive handouts to the ultra-rich, while shrinking programs that protect children, the poor and low-income amongst us. The math here isn’t ideological — it’s arithmetic. Cutting nearly $900 billion from Medicaid under the guise of "work requirements" may sound fiscally austere on paper, but in practice it leaves children’s hospitals, birthing centers and low-income families facing real cuts to care.</p><p>That’s poor policy and it’s poor politics.</p><p>And let’s be honest about that "One Big Beautiful Bill." If the intent was to make life easier for working families, it failed. Instead, too much of the bill rewarded the wealthy while everyday Americans get squeezed. The result is a country where rhetoric about protecting the middle class rings hollow while policy outcomes pad balance sheets at the top and cut support at the bottom.</p><p>This shutdown also reveals what many Americans already know: our healthcare system is brittle and bloated with costs, especially for ordinary families. When the safety net gets clipped, the consequences ripple fast — higher emergency-room use, delayed care and a heavier strain on hospitals that have little margin for error. If leaders actually cared about fiscal prudence and public safety, they’d avoid playing brinkmanship and instead focus on stabilizing coverage for vulnerable people while reforming the delivery and funding of care.</p><p>So what should happen now? First: reopen the government with an eye on protecting the healthcare of working Americans. It’s not a victory for anyone to keep vital services shuttered while negotiators posture on cable news. Second: protect the programs that serve children and our most vulnerable. Medicaid cuts that undercut pediatric care or maternal services should be off the table in any short-term deal.</p><p>Third: our Congress should advance pragmatic reforms that unite rather than divide: targeted job-training programs for those ready to work, streamlined benefits paperwork so help goes to those who need it quickly, and accountability measures that reduce waste without denying care.</p><p>And also, let’s stop with all the misinformation. It helps no one. Despite what Republicans say, there is no proposal to give undocumented immigrants healthcare. They don’t qualify for the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid or Medicare — full stop!</p><p>Americans across the political spectrum want competent government, not political theater. Conservatives who value limited government and lower taxes should be able to demand efficiency and accountability without celebrating disruption that harms the public. Progressives who care about equity and services should demand outcomes that actually help families, not just headlines. The sensible center — where most Americans stand — wants fiscal sanity and a functioning safety net.</p><p>If leaders want credibility, they should stop making shutdowns a bargaining chip. They should instead roll up their sleeves, prioritize the lives of those who rely on the government for stability, and craft reforms that preserve care while cutting waste. Political points won’t fix a newborn’s access to a nearby NICU, a laid-off contractor’s rent bill, or a commuter’s safety at 30,000 feet.</p><p>Again, this isn’t about scoring on cable. It’s about whether we govern like adults or run our country like a reality show. The people have had enough of the latter.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">KT McFARLAND: How Trump's relentless Middle East gamble finally flipped the script</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A few weeks ago, Israeli-Palestinian peace seemed impossible. On Monday, President Donald Trump was in the Middle East, putting the finishing touches on his Gaza peace plan. It happened so fast, he made it look easy.</p><p>But achieving peace was neither fast nor easy. It’s the result of a careful, step-by-step process that President Trump set in motion during the first week of his first term.</p><p>He decided early on that the only path to peace lay in rejecting conventional wisdom and "flipping the script."</p><p>It began in January 2017, when Trump’s top advisers met in the White House Situation Room to assess President Joe Biden’s failed foreign policies. We went around the table, discussing countries and regions. When we got to the Middle East, we faced a choice.</p><p>The Gulf Arab nations were undergoing a generational change in leadership. We could continue working with the older generation of leaders in their seventies. They were a known quantity. The U.S. had done business with them for decades. They were radically conservative, anti-Israel and tolerant of terrorism. But they were also aligned with other American interests, especially oil exports.</p><p>The alternative was to work with the younger, rising generation of leaders in their thirties. President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner argued we should embrace that younger group, even though they were untested. They were Western-educated and comfortable with open societies and diversified economies. They understood that relying on oil revenues alone was a dead end. They were committed to a new direction — one that renounced Islamic extremism and constant war with Israel in favor of social and economic modernization. They would even be open to peace with Israel.</p><p>President Trump flipped the script. He backed that younger generation. Young Gulf Arab leaders came in and out of the White House regularly in those early days. They looked like traditional Arabs in their flowing robes and white headpieces, but they were committed to radical reform and modernization.</p><p>Over the years, those leaders ascended to power, and President Trump forged close personal relationships with them. It was that mutual trust that allowed Trump to negotiate the historic Abraham Accords between Israel and the Gulf Arabs at the end of his first term. Even though President Biden foolishly distanced the U.S. from those leaders when he took office, Trump and Kushner kept the lines of communication open.</p><p>When President Trump returned to the White House, his first official visit was to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf. That younger generation of Arab leaders, now firmly in power, revered him. Trump had both their confidence and their loyalty. Now he would use it to lead the region toward peace. Because he had backed them years before, they would back him now.</p><p>That’s when Trump flipped the script a second time. Conventional wisdom, led by President Biden, sought to placate Iran and distance the U.S. from Israel and the Gulf Arabs.</p><p>Back in office, President Trump reversed course from Biden’s failed policies. He reimposed sanctions to strangle Iran’s economy.</p><p>He resumed America’s strong support of Israel.</p><p>After Oct. 7, President Trump backed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s efforts to defeat Iran’s terrorist proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Gaza and throughout the region.</p><p>Once Iran’s proxies were destroyed and Iran’s economy in ruins, President Trump dismantled Iran’s nuclear weapons program.</p><p>Trump flipped the script a third time a few weeks ago at the United Nations. While the press focused on sabotaged teleprompters and escalators, Trump met privately with Gulf Arab leaders. He convinced Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan and other Muslim nations to sign on to his 20-point peace plan. The linchpin to success was getting Qatar, Hamas’ longtime ally, to agree. President Trump secured that by reining in Israel and providing security assurances.</p><p>Trump got the entire Muslim world to join a peace plan that demanded Hamas disarm and barred them from participating in a postwar Gaza government. In essence, they all abandoned Hamas.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed on to the plan two days later at the White House.</p><p>But would Hamas agree? They had little choice. Their Gulf Arab allies were against them. Their Iranian sponsor was bankrupt and defanged. The entire world had signed on to Trump’s plan. If Hamas refused, Israel had Trump’s permission to "finish the job" once and for all — destroy what remained of Hamas and do it quickly.</p><p>So Hamas signed on to the peace plan rather than face annihilation.</p><p>The hostages are now released. Israel will withdraw from Gaza and abandon efforts to build settlements in Palestinian territories.</p><p>But will it hold? Under normal circumstances, probably not. But the beauty of Trump’s peace plan is that it not only isolates Hamas from the Muslim world, it also separates Hamas from the Palestinian people. The day-after plan offers peace and prosperity for the Palestinian people — but only if Hamas is gone.</p><p>After the cease-fire, the countries in the region have guaranteed to keep the peace and rebuild Gaza. Humanitarian aid, reconstruction and jobs will no longer be funneled through Hamas but will go directly to the Palestinian people through new, Hamas-free governing entities.</p><p>Everyone — Israel, the U.S., the Arabs, the Egyptians, the Turks, and especially the Palestinian people — has a vested interest in keeping Hamas out. Gaza will be rebuilt quickly as regional and international investors and sponsors move in.</p><p>As President Trump says, this is "a historic dawn" for the entire Middle East, not just Gaza. The people of the region will now trade terrorism for technology, commerce for chaos. They will join the Abraham Accords. The Middle East is poised for a golden age for all the Abrahamic peoples. A region at peace could become the gateway for trade and transit from Europe to Asia.</p><p>Only Donald J. Trump could have done this. His dogged determination, endless energy and willingness to turn conventional wisdom on its head made the difference.</p><p>Blessed are the peacemakers.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">The New Jersey governor’s race could show the GOP how to win in midterms</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The midterm elections are a little over a year away. To continue pushing the Trump agenda forward, Republicans must keep control of the House and the Senate.</p><p>Democrats want to make the midterms a referendum on the presidency of Donald Trump. The GOP should counter by making the elections, instead, about the ongoing need to reverse former President Joe Biden’s disastrous excess spending, open borders, climate obsession and soft-on-crime policies. It will take two years to drain the swamp; Republicans will need two more to replant it.</p><p>In New Jersey’s governor’s race, Republican Jack Ciattarelli is doing just that, and is closing the gap with Democrat U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill. The "Jersey Guy" may be creating the template for a GOP victory next November.</p><p>Ciattarelli is running on a platform that promises to oppose sanctuary cities, reject cashless bail for violent and repeat offenders, cap property taxes (New Jersey has the highest in the nation), create a "Parents bill of rights", ban offshore wind farms from New Jersey’s beautiful coastline and create a state DOGE to reduce excess spending.</p><p>In other words, Ciattarelli is taking on some of the worst Democrat policies left behind by Biden. His approach is working with New Jersey voters.</p><p>Panicky Democrats are pouring money into the Garden State to defeat Ciattarelli. The race has tightened, with Democrat U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill now eking out a 4-point advantage, according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls. A few months ago, Sherrill was up by double-digits. </p><p>Sherill’s vanishing lead comes despite big money donors throwing 14 times as much money towards the New Jersey representative as to Ciattarelli and in spite of a super PAC backed by the Democratic Governors Association spending $20 million on TV and digital ads. That’s more, according to NBC, than all groups spent on incumbent Governor Phil Murphy’s campaign in 2021. </p><p>Democrats are right to be nervous. Trump lost New Jersey by only 6 percentage points last year; in 2020 he lost the state by 16 points. New Jersey’s swing towards the president was the second largest in any state. And, when Ciattarelli ran against Governor Phil Murphy in 2021, he lost by only 3 points.</p><p>A Rutgers-Eagleton poll this past summer showed 85% of New Jersey residents dissatisfied with the state’s high cost of living, while 80% were angry about taxes. </p><p>Who is surprised? New Jersey ranks as the fourth highest-taxed state in the U.S. and is also in the top ten most expensive places to live. The Garden State is the 38th state ranked by the cost of doing business and next-to-last in "business friendliness", beaten out only by New York. If businesses cannot thrive, neither do communities. </p><p>One important voter issue that looms large in the current race is the cost of electricity in New Jersey, which has jumped 22% this year; for the U.S. overall, the rise is only 5%. The average residential electricity rate in New Jersey is 25.31 ¢/kWh, a shocking 44% above the national average. Businesses aren’t much better off; the average New Jersey commercial electricity rate is 18.38 ¢/kWh, 29% higher than the national average. </p><p>Ciattarelli blames Democrats, who have controlled the governor’s mansion for the past eight years and the state legislature for over two decades. He reminds voters that when Phil Murphy became governor, New Jersey was a net exporter of energy; today it is an importer, thanks to Democrats’ obsession with climate change.</p><p>In recent years, New Jersey has closed all its coal-fired power plants and a nuclear facility, in part to comply with the ambitions of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the nation’s first cap-and-trade agreement in the U.S., meant to limit carbon emissions from the power sector. Ciattarelli calls the RGGI a "carbon tax policy that has cost New Jersey $300 to $500 million a year." He is correct.</p><p>New Jersey was one of the original members of the RGGI, joining in 2005 under a Democrat governor. In 2012, concerned about rising power costs, Republican governor Chris Christie pulled the state out of the agreement, declaring the program ineffective. He noted that New Jersey’s carbon output was declining not because of the RGGI, but because the state, as elsewhere in the U.S., had replaced coal-burning facilities with natural gas. "RGGI does nothing more than tax electricity, tax our citizens, tax our businesses, with no discernible or measurable impact upon our environment," Mr. Christie said at the time.</p><p>Murphy, whose campaigns have received considerable support from environmental groups, and who embraced the climate follies of the Joe Biden White House, rejoined the RGGI, only to see electricity costs go through the roof. This was inevitable; the cap-and-trade agreement levies additional costs on electric utilities that are then passed on to customers.</p><p>Not only did Murphy make New Jersey residents subject to the cap-and-trade burden, he also blocked natural gas pipelines from carrying abundant and inexpensive fuel to the state, just as New York has done.</p><p>Ciattarelli is educating voters about the costs not only of the RGGI, but also about the long-term costs of relying on the kinds of intermittent and unreliable renewable energy favored by Joe Biden. Electricity prices are important, not only because power is an essential product for every household, but because today’s new technologies require vast amounts of electricity. States that have driven up electricity prices through bad policies will be forced to provide tax incentives and subsidies to attract AI data centers. New Jersey is doing that, diluting the benefits of such investments and further driving electricity costs higher.</p><p>The New Jersey contest will tell us a lot about what to expect in next year’s midterms. Will voters in the Garden State throw out the politicians who have driven businesses and citizens to leave the state for greener pastures, or settle for the second-hand Joe Biden policies that push taxes and costs even higher?</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Students at Rutgers are asking the university president, William F. Tate IV, to publicly support an Antifa-aligned professor who recently fled the country after students in the school’s Turning Point USA chapter raised concerns about him. </p><p>The "Resolution in Support of Professor Mark Bray’s Academic Freedom and Free Expression," is slated for consideration and vote Friday by the Rutgers University Senate, according to a document obtained by Fox News Digital.</p><p>The document asks Rutgers president William F. Tate and his leadership to "Publicly reaffirm its commitment to Dr. Bray’s academic freedom and free expression, and make clear to the Rutgers community and the public that disagreement with the political content of faculty scholarship and speech, absent violations of law or University policy, does not constitute grounds for discipline or institutional distancing." </p><p>It also requests that Tate "Provide Dr. Bray with appropriate legal, safety and logistical support as needed."</p><p>Recently, the Turning Point USA chapter at Rutgers launched a petition to remove Mark Bray, a Rutgers University professor, citing concerns over his past statements supporting Antifa.</p><p>Subsequently, a technology developer launched a Change.org petition to remove the Rutgers TPUSA chapter, accusing the group of promoting "hate speech" and creating a "toxic environment."</p><p>Bray, who is the author of "Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook," "The Anarchist Inquisition: Assassins, Activists, and Martyrs in Spain and France," and "Translating Anarchy: The Anarchism of Occupy Wall Street," said that he would be moving his family to Europe due to safety concerns. On Friday, he announced on Bluesky, the social media platform popular with progressives, "Our plane to Spain is in the air!"</p><p>In "Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook," Bray noted that "at the very least 50 percent of author proceeds will go to the International Anti-Fascist Defense Fund which is administered by more than three hundred antifa from eighteen countries."</p><p>In a Sept. 12 post on Bluesky, Bray promoted a Sept. 13 event he was presenting at in New York City entitled, "Another War Is Possible: Experiences in the fight against deportation, fascism, &amp; capitalist globalization."</p><p>In an Oct. 4 post on Bluesky, Bray wrote, "It’s true that sometimes the law holds back Trump and affords us some semblance of safety. But the more we lean into the law as our shield, the more powerful it will become as a sword when Trump changes it in his favor and wields it against us. Only mass antifascism, legal or not, can save us." </p><p>In the past, Bray has also identified himself as a member of the ​​Black Rose Anarchist Federation, and a participant in the G20 protests in Hamburg, Germany. </p><p>During a podcast interview on the Final Straw Podcast, Bray said, "I've been a political activist for a number of years, involved in a number of different projects and campaigns. I was involved with Occupy Wall Street in New York, I am a member of the Black Rose Anarchist Federation, and the Industrial Workers of the World." </p><p>Megyn Doyle, a student at Rutgers and the treasurer for the Turning Point USA chapter who started the Change.org petition to remove Bray, told Fox News Digital in a statement that she is concerned about what is to come. </p><p>"The Rutgers Legislation and Faculty Union seeking to condemn TPUSA over false allegations shows a pattern of silencing conservatives on campus," Doyle said. </p><p>"Instead of encouraging open dialogue and the right to petition, the actions from the legislation and union seem to protect Mark Bray — known for his alignment with a now-named terrorist organization, antifa," she added. "This double standard should not be tolerated and reveals a disturbing bias within the university."</p><p>Ava Kwan, outreach coordinator for the Turning Point USA chapter at Rutgers, told Fox News Digital in a statement that, "I believe the groups coming forward to condemn our Rutgers Turning Point chapter must be willfully ignorant. While we chose to do things the right way, by creating a petition and presenting the facts about Dr. Antifa to the public, these organizations are choosing to deliberately ignore the truth and peddle the lie that his domestic terrorist affiliation and advocacy for political violence are justified in a public education setting."</p><p>Kwan added, "The Senate’s decision to add in his alleged doxxing and death threats further insinuates the lie that our chapter is somehow linked to those threats, which Doyle and I have publicly stated have nothing to do with Turning Point, and have continued to strongly condemn anyone threatening Bray. Unfortunately, I am not surprised. The slander and lies perpetrated by organizations like this, along with Dr. Antifa himself, are the go-to for the far left, a cowardly symptom of a movement that will do anything but face the truth."</p><p>In a statement to Fox News Digital, a Rutgers spokesperson said: "The University Senate is a university-wide deliberative body consisting of representatives of Rutgers faculty, students, staff, administrators, and alumni that considers matters of general university interest and makes recommendations to the university administration."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Actor Martin Sheen calls Trump the 'biggest nothing in the world,' offers spiritual advice</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Actor Martin Sheen slammed the Trump administration during a taping of Nicolle Wallace’s "The Best People" podcast published Monday, with Sheen referring to the president as the "biggest nothing in the world."</p><p>Sheen, who played President Josiah "Jed" Bartlet on "The West Wing," claimed that President Donald Trump’s actual administration is a corrupt and joyless one.  After blasting ICE agents and suggesting they are wearing masks partially out of shame, Sheen said of the White House, "When you look at this group of people at the roundtable in the White House… every one of those people look across the table and they do not see anyone who is better than they are. They generally see a reflection of their worst selves."</p><p>He added, "There’s no heroes in there. There’s no music. There’s no laughter. There’s no self-effacement. There’s no joy in that room. It smells of ego and fear and false worship."</p><p>Wallace touted the president Sheen portrayed as "one of the best presidents we’ve ever known" offering his advice to the current sitting president. Sheen offered some spiritual advice that humans "start as a ‘nothing,’" but, through accepting vulnerability, can awaken their inner humanity.</p><p>"So the big guy in the White House, if he would take some personal advice — you got to realize, sir, that you are the biggest ‘nothing’ in the world," Sheen said. "And sir, you stop there. You stop listening to all these people around you, these sycophants, who are encouraging you to be your nonhuman self."</p><p>"Get in touch with your humanity," the Hollywood actor said. "Stop fussing with your hair and don’t worry about your tie, and stand up straight and speak clearly, not from your throat. Speak from your heart and start being human. That’s what you were made for, not golf. So there you are, Mr. President. With all due respect, sir."</p><p>Wallace, who is known for fawning over her liberal guests, laughed appreciatively.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Faith-driven Mississippi artist honors Charlie Kirk with powerful portrait despite death threats</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Mississippi artist with a million-strong following recently went viral for his portrait of Charlie Kirk – a piece prominently showcased during Kirk's massive memorial event viewed by millions.</p><p>Samuel Ingram, known on social media as Sam Ryan, painted an image of Kirk with his hands pressed together in front of his face. The artist behind Sam Ryan Studios, Ryan's portrait is suggestive of prayer or reflection.</p><p>Kirk's expression in the painting is serious and contemplative, and Ryan incorporated prominent reds, blacks, whites and blues, evoking patriotic themes.</p><p>Speaking to Fox News Digital on Sunday – two days before what would have been Kirk's 32nd birthday – Ryan said that he personally spoke with Kirk last year.</p><p>At the time, Ryan's painting of President Donald Trump after his July 13, 2024, assassination attempt was going viral. The Turning Point USA founder reached out to him soon after he saw the Trump painting and expressed an interest in buying a print.</p><p>"His DM said, ‘I love it, man. I need to get this for the studio. When are you doing a print of it?'" recalled Ryan. "And that was the last thing I heard from him."</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of Kirk's Sept. 10 assassination at Utah Valley University, Ryan felt compelled to commemorate him.</p><p>"I wanted to do him a service," he said. "The best way I could was to memorialize him for everybody to see and add to his legacy, especially with the reference photo that I used from Dan Fleuette of Charlie praying."</p><p>"I felt that was the perfect reference that represented him."</p><p>Ryan said that he painted the portrait in 12 hours, overnight. He shared it with the world at 8 a.m. on Sept. 11 after a sleepless night.</p><p>"That was a way for me to show my respect to him and his family — to put that out there for him," said Ryan.</p><p>The tribute wasn't without pushback. The artist said that he lost 44,000 followers on Instagram, and collectively, over 100,000 social media users unfollowed him across all his platforms, including Facebook and TikTok.</p><p>Ryan said that, even over a month after Kirk died, he still receives death threats on Instagram.</p><p>"All for painting somebody I had a personal connection with," said Ryan. "It wasn’t really a political statement, even though I am conservative."</p><p>"It was more of a personal sentiment for his family and something God’s given me the ability to do — to paint and do portraiture in the style that I do that attracts attention somehow."</p><p>But luckily, the support outweighed the hate, and Ryan's work has attracted over a million like-minded conservatives and Christians.</p><p>"I gained over a million total followers across all my platforms… I think a couple hundred thousand per platform," he said.</p><p>Ryan also traveled all the way from Mississippi to Arizona to attend Kirk's memorial service on Sept. 21. He described the experience as being bittersweet — a career milestone, but one under tragic circumstances.</p><p>To Ryan, Kirk's death is evocative of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ — a reflection, he said, of how those who speak truth often face persecution.</p><p>"A lot of the time, people don’t want to hear the truth — they want to be comforted," he said. "I think he shook a lot of demons that are hiding in the world out there, and they took him out because of that."</p><p> "Jesus, it only took twelve [disciples] for Him to spread the message — and Charlie had a lot more than twelve getting the word out. When you get all those eyeballs on you, there are a lot of crazy people in the audience that just hate you for spreading the message of the gospels."</p><p>The faith-driven painter said that he hopes those who unfollowed him are able to see that Kirk was a "human being, and he didn’t deserve that."</p><p>"Because to me, and what I know, he never said anything hateful, racist, like you’ve been seeing all these clips," he said. "He never said anything that was downright wrong."</p><p>"I would just like to tell them that he was a human being too," added Ryan. "And I have a heart — that’s something a lot of people don’t have. They can’t get over their emotions over political sides."</p><p>Ryan said that the painting will be put up in the Turning Point USA headquarters. Because of all the interest in the painting, he'll be selling a small print personally signed by him from Oct. 17 to 19 on samryanstudio.com.</p><p>"About 20,000 people [are] on the wait list so far, and we’re going to have a limited number of limited-edition prints," he said. "So it’ll be a first come, first served basis." </p><p>Ultimately, guided by faith, Ryan hopes his work turns others toward faith and goodness.</p><p>"Anything that makes people feel something is what inspires me, and I hope to just spread the good in the world and block out the bad," he said.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump declines to commit to two-state solution after historic Gaza peace deal: 'We'll have to see'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump, when asked about the prospect of a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, declined to commit, telling reporters, "We’ll have to see." </p><p>The comments came during a press gaggle aboard Air Force One as Trump returned home after signing a historic peace agreement that ended two years of fighting in Gaza. </p><p>When the topic came up, Trump said he was focused on rebuilding Gaza after two years of Israeli bombardment, following the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre by Hamas. </p><p>"I’m not talking about a single state or double state or two state," Trump said, adding: "A lot of people like the one-state solution, some people like the two-state solution. We’ll have to see." </p><p>Trump said any decision on the matter would be made in coordination with regional and international partners. </p><p>The president concluded a whirlwind trip Monday that included a global peace summit in Egypt and a speech before the Knesset in Jerusalem earlier in the day, where he celebrated a U.S.-brokered ceasefire with Hamas.</p><p>Speaking to leaders gathered in Egypt, Trump called for a new era of harmony in the Middle East, seeking to advance broader peace in the region.</p><p>"We have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to put the old feuds and bitter hatreds behind us," Trump said, urging leaders "to declare that our future will not be ruled by the fights of generations past."</p><p>Leaders from dozens of countries, including from Europe and the Middle East, attended the summit. </p><p>Trump, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani signed a document outlining a broad vision for Gaza's future.</p><p>Twenty hostages were released Monday as part of an agreement intended to end the war in Gaza. Trump met with some of their families during his visit to the Knesset.</p><p>The moment remains fragile, however, as Israel and Hamas are still in the early stages of implementing the first phase of Trump's peace plan.</p><p>The sides have not agreed on Gaza's postwar governance, its reconstruction, or Israel's demand that Hamas disarm. Negotiations over those issues could break down, and Israel has hinted it may resume military operations if its demands are not met.</p><p>Much of Gaza has been reduced to rubble, and the territory's roughly 2 million residents continue to struggle in dire conditions. Under the deal, Israel agreed to reopen five border crossings to ease the flow of food and supplies into Gaza, parts of which are experiencing famine.</p><p>Roughly 200 U.S. troops will also help monitor and support the ceasefire deal as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector groups.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">With hostages freed, Trump thanks others in Israel speech but is too quick to declare war is over</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>It was a speech unlike any other President Trump has delivered.</p><p>After freeing the Hamas hostages – a moment of pure joy – he spent most of his address to the Israeli parliament praising others.</p><p>There was constant applause at the Knesset in Jerusalem yesterday as Trump invoked "the almighty God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob" – and then hailed more modern figures.</p><p>Bibi Netanhayu. Marco Rubio. Pete Hegseth. Jared Kushner (mentioning that his daughter Ivanka had converted to Judaism to marry him). Various generals. And Steve Witkoff – he went on and on about the talents of his Mideast envoy and his four-hour meeting with Vladimir Putin.</p><p>The president also said he’d gotten invaluable help from Arab and Muslim nations as he envisioned "peace, God willing, for all eternity."</p><p>All eternity is a long time – and while Trump didn’t exactly land on an aircraft carrier with a Mission Accomplished banner, à la George W. Bush, he explicitly said he views the war as over.</p><p>Watching the Israeli footage of some of the 20 freed hostages tearfully embracing family members, it was impossible not to be moved. Even when watching it a second or third time, given the horrifying ordeal they have endured. If your heart wasn’t stuck in your throat, you don’t have a heart.</p><p>As Trump loosened up and began ad-libbing, the message was clear: He was the one who had orchestrated this peace deal. He was also careful to blame the war on the "heinous" Oct. 7 massacre by the Hamas terrorists, causing the greatest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust. </p><p>Still, Trump couldn’t restrain himself from taking partisan shots at Joe Biden and Barack Obama. </p><p>He really went off-script late in the hourlong speech by turning to Israel’s president and suggesting he give Netanyahu a pardon. Bibi is the defendant in a long-running corruption trial that has been dragged out in part because of the two-year war.</p><p>I was among the first to observe last week that Trump’s international peacemaking was in stark contrast to his refusal to negotiate with Democrats to end the government shutdown that has stretched into its second week. Peace abroad but not at home. But right now the red-hot media spotlight is on the Mideast.</p><p>When Trump was running out of people to thank, he praised Israel’s opposition leader, Yair Lapid. And he spotted Miriam Adelson, the widow of billionaire Sheldon Adelson, and coaxed her into standing up, as they regularly visited Trump on Israel’s behalf. </p><p>You know who is praising Trump? Hillary Clinton. Rahm Emanuel. Condoleezza Rice. Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan. John Fetterman (You know who won’t mention his name? Obama, called out by CNN).</p><p>Trump was even drawing plaudits on MSNBC from the likes of Jon Meacham and Ben Rhodes, at least for the short-term win.</p><p>One can detest a president of the other party, or other ideological divide, and still applaud when he does something that’s good for America and the world. </p><p>Trump knows full well the difficulties ahead, which is why he left for Egypt to sign the deal and conduct further negotiations with Arab leaders.</p><p>On CNN, on MSNBC, on Fox, which got an exclusive pull-aside interview with Trump, the tone was much the same – upbeat, celebratory, filled with praise, but also wary of what comes next – and those are fair journalistic questions.</p><p>Some former Israeli officials and journalists said this could have been achieved a year or 18 months ago, but that Netanyahu wanted to keep fighting. Trump agreed that Netanyahu wanted to keep fighting, calling him a tough man to deal with, and forced him to accept the peace plan by threatening to walk away. He even forced Bibi to apologize to Qatar for attacking the exiled Hamas leadership there. Without almost breaking Bibi’s arm, none of this would have happened. </p><p>Check this out: Trump said in Egypt: "I want to thank the media, you’ve been so respectful," that he had listened to various newscasts on Air Force One, and they had been "all fair." Wowza.</p><p>This was during a pull-aside interview with Fox’s Trey Yingst, who’s been my guest so many times. "You are a real professional — not because it’s good or bad, you’re just really professional," Trump told him. "It would be great if other people could do what you do because they put negative spin" on the news.</p><p>Among other things, Trump said he wants to make a deal with Iran – which would horrify many Israelis – but spoke only briefly about the Council of Peace, which he would head and which would include Arab and European leaders. The U.S. would contribute 200 troops based outside Gaza. </p><p>Taking press questions with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, Trump projected optimism about Phase 2 of the process. But he knows it’s no cakewalk, to borrow a phrase from a Bush defense adviser, Ken Adelman, whose Washington Post op-ed said "Cakewalk in Iraq" – and the resulting quagmire turned out to be anything but.</p><p>The question of who will run Gaza, and whether what remains of Hamas will turn in their weapons, is very much up in the air.</p><p>The strip has largely been reduced to rubble. What the region needs, more than military guarantees, is money, from the wealthier Arab nations. </p><p>With 2 million Palestinians having been displaced or lost their homes, will the top priority be building housing? Or will it be putting up hotels, to attract tourists? It’s hard to imagine many people taking vacations there for years to come.</p><p>In urging Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, Trump said: "Cigars and Champagne, who the hell cares about that?"</p><p>The prime minister has delayed the trial through stalling tactics and diplomatic moves related to the war. He says the whole thing is a left-wing plot against his right-wing government, if that sounds familiar.</p><p>Israeli prosecutors say he exchanged regulatory favors with media big-shots for positive coverage, and 140 witnesses, including former aides, have testified against him.</p><p>In one case, Bibi and his wife Sara are charged with accepting $260,000 worth of luxury goods, including the cigars, bubbly and jewelry, for political favors.</p><p>In urging Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, Israelis were stunned, and said it could never happen because if such a pardon did magically materialize, it would require an admission of guilt by the prime minister. </p><p>Look, the 47th president says and does plenty of things that are strange, self-serving, hyperpartisan, infuriating or factually challenged.</p><p>Here’s an example from Truth Social:</p><p>"THE BIDEN FBI PLACED 274 AGENTS INTO THE CROWD ON JANUARY 6. If this is so, which it is, a lot of very good people will be owed big apologies. What a SCAM - DOSOMETHING!!! President DJT."</p><p>The problem? Therewas no Biden FBI on Jan. 6, 2021–Trump was still president! Hard to see how he could make that mistake.</p><p>Still, Trump is talking about a "golden age for Israel and the Middle East," which is a great goal. No other president could have pulled this off, and he richly deserves the praise. But the larger goal, a long-term peace in the volatile region, for the moment, remains a dream. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A wet and wild Monday night game between the Chicago Bears and Washington Commanders turned into a thriller between two of the NFL’s oldest franchises.</p><p>Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels fumbled a handoff late in the fourth quarter and allowed the Bears’ defense to recover. Caleb Williams and D’Andre Swift led the offense down the field to set up a Jake Moody field goal attempt. It was Moody’s first day on the roster as the team signed him to replace an injured Cairo Santos.</p><p>Moody, with three seconds left and a steady mist coming down, nailed a 38-yard field goal to give the Bears the 25-24 win. Chicago improved to 3-2 with the win and the Commanders fell to 3-3.</p><p>The Bears jumped out to an early 13-0 lead in the first half. Moody was seemingly in good form. He nailed two field goals and Caleb Williams ran for a touchdown to start the second quarter.</p><p>The Commanders cut into the Bears’ lead when Daniels threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to Chris Moore. Washington got more points on the board after an eight-play, 25-yard drive in the third quarter, which ended with a Matt Gay field goal.</p><p>After Moody hit his third field goal of the night, the Bears’ offense went quiet.</p><p>Daniels led back-to-back scoring drives at the end of the third quarter and to start the fourth. He found Luke McCaffrey for a 33-yard touchdown pass and then fired a 6-yard touchdown to Zach Ertz.</p><p>Williams and the Bears didn’t stay down too long. The second-year quarterback hit Swift on a short pass. Swift made a few Commanders defenders miss and scampered for a 55-yard touchdown. Chicago missed out on a 2-point conversion and was down two points.</p><p>Moody was on point with his field-goal tries, despite one getting blocked.</p><p>He was cut by the San Francisco 49ers only a few weeks into the 2025 season, despite having a place in the record books during Super Bowl LVIII.</p><p>Moody turned around and etched his name into the Bears’ record books, making the most field goals in a Bears debut with four, according to ESPN.</p><p>"It’s always good to have a fresh start. I always believed in myself, believed in my teammates. Shoutout to (long snapper Scott Daly) and (holder Tory Taylor). They made the operation really easy on me. The same with the (offensive) line up front, protecting great on that last one. You can’t draw it up any better," he told ESPN’s Lisa Salters.</p><p>Williams was 17-of-29 with 252 passing yards and a touchdown pass. He completed passes to eight different receivers. Swift led the team with two catches for 67 yards. Luther Burden III had four catches for 51 yards.</p><p>Swift had 14 carries for 108 yards as well.</p><p>Daniels finished 19-of-26 with 211 passing yards, three touchdown passes and an interception. The Bears’ defense had three takeaways.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Atlanta Falcons used their bye week to find the right answers for the Buffalo Bills, who they beat 24-14 on "Monday Night Football."</p><p>The Falcons improved to 3-2 on the season, while the Bills have now lost two straight after starting the season 4-0. </p><p>While there were explosive offensive plays that contributed to this Falcons victory, their defense being able to handle Bills quarterback Josh Allen was just as important at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Monday night. Allen was sacked four times, the most by any team this season, as the Falcons didn’t just get pressure in the backfield, but made sure he couldn’t escape for big rushing yards. </p><p>However, the highlight reel is surely going to have the Falcons’ offensive stars, running back Bijan Robinson and wide receiver Drake London, leading the way after their generous contributions to that side of the ball. </p><p>Robinson rushed for 170 yards on 19 carries with an 81-yard touchdown that blew this game wide open in favor of the home team. The play came right after Allen was sacked for a 15-yard loss on third down, forcing a punt by the Bills. Robinson wasted no time, finding a hole at the line of scrimmage and bouncing out to the right where safety Cole Bishop couldn’t get him out of bounds, and it was off to the races. </p><p>But before Robinson’s magic, London showcased his strength when he caught a nine-yard pass from Penix near the goal line and reached his long arms across with the ball for six points, all while being tackled. That gave the Falcons the lead back, which they originally had thanks to Tyler Allgeier’s first carry of the game going for a 21-yard touchdown on the opening drive. </p><p>Allen was able to also find Dawson Knox for an opening-drive touchdown, but they had to punt four straight times before he threw an interception near the end of the first half. It was an uncharacteristic performance for the Bills’ offense, but their defense made adjustments in the second half to keep them in the game. </p><p>Allen and the Bills started the third quarter with the touchdown drive they needed, as Ray Davis caught a short pass from his quarterback and took it 16 yards for the score. But once again, the Bills’ offense stalled as the Falcons continued to come up with stops. </p><p>With a 21-14 lead in the fourth quarter, Michael Penix Jr. and his offense were looking to put a seal on their victory, and they did so with a drive that took up 5 minutes of clock and ended with a Parker Romo field goal to make it a two-possession game. </p><p>Allen tried for a miracle on the ensuing drive, but he was picked off after a deflected pass in the red zone as the Falcons celebrated their win. </p><p>In the box score, Penix was 20-of-32 for 250 yards with his touchdown pass to London, who led the game with 158 yards on 10 catches. Robinson also added 68 yards on six catches to total over 230 scrimmage yards in a brilliant game. </p><p>For the Bills, Allen was just 15-of-26 with two touchdowns and two interceptions. James Cook was kept relatively silent in this game with 87 yards on 17 carries. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>"Late Show" host Stephen Colbert played a murdered talk show host in the quirky detective series "Elsbeth."</p><p>Colbert announced to his audience in July that CBS is cancelling his show in spring 2026. The show’s cancellation follows the network and its parent company’s settlement with President Donald Trump over the summer after he sued both for "election interference" over a "60 Minutes" interview edit of his 2024 opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><p>But the talk show host is generating new headlines this week for appearing in "Elsbeth's" Season 3 premiere. Colbert portrayed the eponymous late night talk show host of "Way Late with Scotty Bristol," who is murdered by his executive producer.</p><p>According to IMDb, "Elsbeth" focuses on an "Astute but unconventional attorney Elsbeth Tascioni utilizes her singular point of view to make unique observations and corner brilliant criminals alongside the NYPD."</p><p>With recent controversies about late-night talk shows ranging from the cancellation of Colbert’s show to the brief suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" some, like culture writer Emma Fraser, wrote in the Daily Beast that one "might be under the impression that showrunner Jonathan Tolins is taking a ripped-from-the-headlines approach to the popular series."</p><p>However, the truth is more complicated, as showrunner Tolins reportedly wrote the episode before Colbert announced his show was being shut down. </p><p>"The first thing that he [Colbert] said to me was, ‘Wow, everybody’s gonna think that the Elsbeth writers have the biggest balls in Hollywood,’" Carrie Preston, who plays the titular character, told The Daily Beast.</p><p>But while Colbert plays a talk show host who is literally killed, the character he plays is one that does not appear to be based on himself.</p><p>"Scotty isn’t the kindest TV star or boss, which is why his executive producer, Laurel (Amy Sedaris), turns a paper shredder into a murder weapon," Fraser wrote.</p><p>"Although they have the same job, Scotty Bristol is not the loving, accepting, wonderful, and welcoming person that Stephen Colbert is," Preston said.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Keira Knightley 'very sorry' she didn't know about JK Rowling boycott before joining 'Potter' audio cast</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Actress Keira Knightley said she was "not aware" of fan calls to boycott the new "Harry Potter" Full Cast audiobooks and said she was "very sorry."</p><p>"I was not aware of that, no. I’m very sorry," Knightley told Decider when asked about the calls to boycott Rowling.</p><p>Some "Harry Potter" fans were calling for the new audiobooks to be boycotted due to author J.K. Rowling’s views on transgender issues. Rowling has been an outspoken critic of transgender ideology and an advocate for women who she says have been harmed as a result. Rowling’s stance has made her the target of fierce criticism, and has caused a rift between her and the cast of the "Harry Potter" films.</p><p>Emma Watson, who played Hermione Granger in the film franchise, made a veiled criticism of Rowling in 2020 after the author began speaking out against transgender ideology. Rowling criticized a news article that referred to women as "people who menstruate," in a post that went viral on X, formerly Twitter.</p><p>"I want my trans followers to know that I and so many other people around the world see you, respect you and love you for who you are," Watson had posted, seemingly in response to Rowling, at the time. </p><p>In a September podcast appearance, Watson said she still "treasure[s]" Rowling despite their differing views on transgender issues.</p><p>"I really don’t believe that by having had that experience and holding the love and support and views that I have, mean that I can’t and don’t treasure Jo [Rowling], and the person that I had personal experiences with, I will never believe that one negates the other and that my experiences of that person, I don’t get to keep and cherish. I just don’t think these things are either-or," Watson said on the "On Purpose" podcast.  </p><p>Rowling responded on X, making it clear she was in no mood to reconcile. She shot down an X user’s contention that they were confident she would one day forgive Watson and Daniel Radcliffe, who played the titular role and has also been critical of Rowling’s views on transgenderism.</p><p>"Celebs who cozied up to a movement intent on eroding women’s hard-won rights and who used their platforms to cheer on the transitioning of minors can save their apologies for traumatized detransitioners and vulnerable women reliant on single-sex spaces," Rowling wrote. </p><p>The director of the first two "Harry Potter" films, Chris Columbus, also addressed Rowling in a September interview. He said that he wished he could direct a film adaptation of Rowling’s play "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" but that her differences with the cast made it "impossible."</p><p>"I haven’t spoken to Miss Rowling in a decade or so, so I have no idea what’s going on with her, but I keep very close contact with Daniel Radcliffe and I just spoke to him a few days ago. I still have a great relationship with all the kids in the cast," Columbus told The Times of London.</p><p>Knightley, who will voice Professor Umbridge in the audiobooks, went on to express her hope that "we can all find respect." She did not give any indication that she would be participating in the boycott. </p><p>"You know, I think we’re all living in a period of time right now where we’re all going to have to figure out how to live together, aren’t we? And we’ve all got very different opinions. I hope that we can all find respect," Knightley said. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Kylie Jenner faces backlash over handcuffed jail promo video for new cosmetics launch</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Kylie Jenner's promo for her new King Kylie Cosmetics collection has fans divided, with critics describing it as "deeply out of touch."</p><p>On Sunday, the 28-year-old reality star posted a short clip on Instagram in which she was seen handcuffed as she strutted down a jail hallway while flanked by two police officers. </p><p>Jenner donned a black leather bra and matching micro shorts that had hanging silver chains attached at the hips. She accessorized with black fishnet tights and chunky silver jewelry along with a pair of black slingback pumps. </p><p>The makeup mogul wore her long dark hair down in loose curls with teal streaks — a nod to the daring colors that she sported during her "King Kylie" era. </p><p>The video concluded as the screen cut to black and a woman was heard whispering "King Kylie" while the words "King Kylie. Tomorrow" flashed across the screen.</p><p>Jenner's new makeup collection is a callback to the rebellious "King Kylie" persona that she popularized during the mid 2010s that helped launch her early brand identity. At the time, Jenner became known for her edgy, experimental looks, especially after dyeing her hair blue. </p><p>The time period coincided with the 2015 launch of her makeup brand, Kylie Cosmetics, which she built into a beauty empire. </p><p>After Jenner shared the teaser, fans and some of her famous friends flocked to the comments section of her post to express their excitement over her new collection. </p><p>"exactly," Hailey Bieber wrote while Lauren Sánchez Bezos added a raised hands emoji. One fan wrote, "KING KYLIE IS BACK," with another writing: "We're back."</p><p>However, online critics vented their fury in a thread on Reddit, slamming the model for the imagery she used amid the ongoing ICE raids and renewed debate over policing and immigration enforcement.</p><p>"The country’s boiling over, citizens being dragged off by rogue badge hungry rent-a-cops, and Kylie Jenner drops a handcuffed hot-pants photoshoot to promote COSMETICS. This isn’t satire; it’s American rot," wrote one Reddit user alongside a screengrab from the promo. </p><p>"She is out of touch," another agreed. </p><p>"lol as if she could ever comprehend what the people she cosplays as are going thru," one critic added. "this is insanely disgusting, and i didnt even think about how <i>deeply</i> out of touch this was til i read your title for this post. you’re so right."</p><p>Other Reddit users criticized Jenner for reviving her "King Kylie" branding, noting it followed the recent "No Kings" protests against perceived authoritarianism under the Trump administration. </p><p>"To add to this, does anyone else find it odd that there have been ‘No Kings’ protests around the country, and she drops a shoot called ‘King Kylie’ with the associated imagery mentioned by OP [original poster]?" one commenter wrote. </p><p>Some critics compared the promo to other controversial celebrity marketing campaigns, including Jenner's sister Kendall Jenner’s 2017 Pepsi ad. </p><p>In the commercial, Jenner was seen leaving a fashion photoshoot to join a protest, where she ends tension between demonstrators and police by handing an officer a can of Pepsi. </p><p>Fans quickly slammed the ad as tone-deaf and exploitative. Within 48 hours, Pepsi pulled the campaign and apologized, admitting it had "missed the mark." </p><p>Jenner later tearfully addressed the incident on an episode of "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," saying she felt "so f----- stupid."</p><p>"Is she actually trying to recreate the same controversy Kendall went through with the tone-deaf Pespi [sic] ad???" one Reddit user wrote of Jenner. </p><p>"the outrage over this should compare kendall’s pepsi campaign…. like it’s that all over again…." another agreed. </p><p>Jenner has not spoken out about the controversy.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Jenner's representative for comment. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Ellen Greenberg’s death has once again been ruled a suicide, following a new review by the Philadelphia Medical Examiner’s Office, according to media reports.</p><p>Per People, the report reaffirms that Greenberg, a 27-year-old Philadelphia schoolteacher, died by suicide despite sustaining 20 stab wounds to her back, neck, and head, with a knife found protruding from her chest.</p><p>Greenberg, who taught first grade at Juniata Park Academy, was found dead in her locked apartment on January 26, 2011, after returning home early from work due because of a snowstorm. </p><p>Her fiancé, Samuel Goldberg, said he discovered her body after forcing open the door when she didn’t respond. Goldberg was never a suspect and was never charged with any crime.</p><p>The circumstances, including multiple stab wounds and no signs of forced entry, have fueled years of debate and legal challenges from her family over whether her death was self-inflicted.</p><p>The new ruling sparked backlash, with the Greenberg family attorney Joseph Podraza Jr. saying in a statement that the review was "a deeply flawed attempt to justify a predetermined conclusion."</p><p>"It includes false claims like the assertion that a stab wound in Ellen’s spinal column was made during the autopsy, a theory rejected by every credible expert, including the City’s own neuropathologist," Podraza said in a statement.</p><p>"By ignoring key evidence that contradicts suicide, the extensive 3D photogrammetry, a recreation which proves Ellen could not self-inflict all the wounds, unexplained bruises, missing surveillance footage, an intact lock, accounts of a toxic relationship," he said.</p><p>Greenberg’s death was initially ruled a homicide in 2011, before Assistant Medical Examiner Dr. Marlon Osbourne changed the manner of death to suicide after meeting with Philadelphia Police investigators.</p><p>Chief Medical Examiner Lindsay Simon led the most recent review as part of a settlement with Greenberg’s parents, who have spent years contesting the suicide finding.</p><p>In February, Greenberg's family settled lawsuits with the City of Philadelphia and others, asking them to reevaluate Ellen's manner of death. The family said it should be changed to homicide or undetermined.</p><p>Per People, the new report said that "while the distribution of injuries is admittedly unusual, the fact remains that Ellen would be capable of inflicting these injuries herself," noting she was a "young woman suffering from anxiety."</p><p>The chief medical examiner wrote that "the fiancé’s DNA was not detected on the knife used to inflict the injuries" and that there was no evidence of an abusive relationship or a struggle at the scene. </p><p>"With all of this information considered, it is the opinion of the undersigned that the manner of Ellen Greenberg’s death is best classified as ‘suicide,'" the report said.</p><p>In his statement, Podraza said Simon's report was "an embarrassment to the City, and an insult to Ellen and her family."</p><p>"Ellen’s family just wanted the truth. It is clear the truth will not come from Philadelphia’s law enforcement machinery. Though Ellen’s city turned its back on her, we will continue through other avenues to get justice for her murder, by any means necessary," he said.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the Philadelphia Medical Examiner’s Office and the City of Philadelphia Law Department for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The NFL announced that Detroit Lions safety Brian Branch was suspended one game without pay for his fight with Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Juju Smith-Schuster on Sunday night.</p><p>"Your aggressive, non-football act was entirely unwarranted, posed a serious risk of injury, and clearly violated the standards of conduct and sportsmanship expected of NFL players," Jon Runyan, the NFL vice president of football operations, wrote in a letter to Branch, per ESPN. "Your conduct reflected poorly on the NFL and has no place in our game."</p><p>Branch will reportedly appeal his suspension, according to NFL Network. </p><p>Branch is currently set to miss the team’s Monday night game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 7. </p><p>The incident occurred after the Lions fell to the Chiefs, 30-17, on Sunday night. Patrick Mahomes was seen trying to high-five Branch, but the latter completely ignored him and went up to Smith-Schuster. They exchanged a few words, and Branch proceeded to slap Smith-Schuster across the helmet. </p><p>Smith-Schuster went to the ground, but would quickly get back on his feet and charge at Branch. Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco tried to get in between them to break up the altercation, but Branch ripped off Smith-Schuster’s helmet as players from both teams started to get involved in the scrum. </p><p>After players and coaches finally got the situation under control, Branch regretted his decision to start the bout. </p><p>"It was a childish thing, but I'm tired of people doing stuff in between the play and refs don't catch it," Branch said. "They be trying to bully me out there. I should have never did it. It was childish."</p><p>Lions head coach Dan Campbell also condemned Branch’s actions after the game. </p><p>"I love Brian Branch, but what he did is inexcusable, and it's not going to be accepted here. It's not what we do. It's not what we're about," Campbell said. "I apologized to coach (Andy) Reid and the Chiefs, and Smith-Schuster. </p><p>"That's not OK. That's not what we do here. It's not going to be OK. He knows it. Our team knows it. That's not what we do."</p><p>Branch has already been fined this season for an unsportsmanlike situation.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche criticized the New York Times for an article on Monday claiming that Blanche had "disdain" for Patel.</p><p>The article, titled "Part Enabler, Part Buffer: The Bind of the Justice Dept.’s No. 2," centered on Blanche allegedly clashing with other members of the Trump administration in terms of agenda, including Attorney General Pam Bondi. </p><p>Reporters Glenn Thrush and Alan Feuer claimed that both Bondi and Blanche, however, were united in their dislike for Patel.</p><p>"They bonded, in particular, over their mutual disdain for the FBI director, Kash Patel, whom they view as a lightweight more interested in social media than doing his job, according to seven current and former administration officials," they wrote. "Mr. Patel is supposed to report to Mr. Blanche. In reality, Mr. Blanche and Ms. Bondi sometimes have trouble getting him on the same page with them, those people said."</p><p>Both Blanche and Patel pushed back on their X accounts, attacking the publication as "failing" and "trash."</p><p>"Hey @FBIDirectorKash- the failing New York Times says we don’t like each other. Guess we’ll have to stop hanging out after work? Those dummies. Virtually every part of their ‘reporting’ is exaggerated or fabricated, per usual. If it wasn’t for Wordle, nobody would subscribe," Blanche wrote.</p><p>Patel responded, "NYTrash- the journalistic equivalent of crash test dummies."</p><p>In a comment to Fox News Digital, a New York Times spokesperson said, "The Times's article is based on conversations with seven current and former administration officials with direct knowledge of the working relationships inside the Justice Department. We are confident in our reporting."</p><p>Patel and Blanche were recently interviewed last week by Fox News Digital at the FBI’s Chicago Field Office regarding President Donald Trump’s crackdown on crime and illegal immigration through "Operation Midway Blitz." </p><p>During the interview, Patel dismissed reports from mainstream media claiming that former FBI Director James Comey would be arrested and paraded in a "perp walk" display.</p><p>"The mainstream media wants to take the eye off the ball and create theater," Patel said. "We're not about theater. We're about producing our results in court.

The Browns, Steelers and Bengals each play in the AFC North.</p><p>Tomlin and the Steelers dominated the Browns in Week 6 and now play the Bengals on Thursday night to start Week 7.</p><p>"To be honest, it was shocking to me," Tomlin said of the trade, via Pro Football Talk. "Andrew Berry must be a lot smarter than me or us, because it doesn’t make sense to me to trade a quarterback that you think enough of to make your opening starter to a divisional opponent that’s hurting in that area. But that’s just my personal feeling."</p><p>Tomlin went on to praise Flacco’s savviness as he gets more ingrained into the Bengals’ offense.</p><p>Flacco led the Browns to a victory over the Green Bay Packers on Sept. 21.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The National Hockey League played seven games in its young 2025-2026 season by the end of the day last Wednesday. The contests featured a grand total of two fights. </p><p>The government shutdown had run for eight days by the end of the day on that Wednesday. And the now lengthy shutdown sparked two extraordinary verbal brawls in the halls of Congress between lawmakers.</p><p>NHL referees Gord Dwyer and Mitch Dunning worked the Washington Capitals/Boston Bruins tilt Wednesday night in DC. Perhaps the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms could have summoned Dwyer and Dunning up to Capitol Hill to dole out a few ten-minute misconducts beforehand.</p><p>"You're embarrassing yourself right now!" hollered House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., at Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y.</p><p>"The only embarrassment here is you!" thundered Lawler at Jeffries.</p><p>Tempers exploded as Lawler lay in wait outside the House Radio/TV Gallery Studio for a shutdown smackdown after Jeffries concluded his now-daily press conference. </p><p>"You're not going to talk to me and talk over me when you don't want to hear what I'm going to say!" yelled an animated Jeffries at Lawler, jabbing his index finger toward his colleague's chest but never poking him. </p><p>"Oh, I'm listening," said Lawler.</p><p>"So just keep your mouth shut!" shouted the usually cool Jeffries. </p><p>There were multiple rounds of vocal fisticuffs between Members and Congressional leaders.</p><p>Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., summoned the press to the hallway outside the office of House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to complain about the shutdown and criticize the Speaker for not swearing-in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., more than two weeks after her election. Johnson then confronted the Arizona senators. And Lawler was nearby, serving as "fourth man in."</p><p>"This is absurd," seethed an exasperated Johnson.</p><p>"This is the longest the House has gone…" interrupted Gallego.</p><p>"Do you want me to answer the question?" shot back Johnson.</p><p>"You’re not actually answering the question," countered Gallego.</p><p>The multiple rounds of brawls in the halls between lawmakers were nearly unprecedented in Congress. The shutdown smackdowns featured arguments about health care. Lawler waved around legislation focused on the Democrats’ push during the shutdown: a package to extend Obamacare subsidies.</p><p>"If you believe in it so much!" chided Lawler, with a rhetorical uppercut. </p><p>"Bro, do you understand math?" counterpunched Jeffries.</p><p>Tensions are spiking at the Capitol. Yours truly asked Johnson about Lawler confronting Jeffries and his decision to step out of the Speaker’s Office to engage Kelly and Gallego. I noted to the Speaker that if the House was in session, there may be fistfights in the hallways.</p><p>"Are you concerned and is it incumbent upon you as the Speaker to try to lower this temperature?" I asked.</p><p>Johnson added that the contretemps "concerns me." He added that he wanted to "restore civility to the institution."</p><p>"Let's have policy disputes. But not make it personal. This gets personal. Emotions are high. People are upset. I'm upset. I'm a very patient man. But I am very angry right now because this is dangerous stuff. And so is it better for them to be physically separated right now? It probably is." said Johnson. </p><p>Lawmakers aren’t the only ones raging. Thousands of federal workers are fuming at the shutdown. The administration is now firing federal workers. </p><p>"Right now, many families are paying the price for political gridlock that they didn't cause," said American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley.</p><p>Rep. Sarah Elfreth, D-Md., represents 44,000 federal employees in her district near Washington, DC. She notes that Maryland has lost 15,000 federal jobs since President Trump took office in January. </p><p>"I believe that (the firings) are not only unethical and immoral, but illegal for him to be RIF-ing people during a shutdown. There's no new authority granted to the President or OMB during a shutdown," said Elfreth. "I don't believe in negotiating by threat. It also shows that I think they have the weaker hand and that they're losing the PR battle nationally to resort to threats."</p><p>While the shutdown is the main event, the undercard is a fight between Democrats and Johnson over Grijalva to succeed her late father, Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz. The elder Grijalva died in March after a battle with cancer.</p><p>"I can't hire staff. We don't have an office," said Grijalva "So it's very much second-class citizen feeling for me."</p><p>Democrats have tried on multiple occasions to compel the House to swear-in Grijalva during brief, pro forma sessions where the body gavels in and gavels out after just a few seconds. Once in office, Grijalva would provide the crucial 218th signature to go over the head of the Speaker and force the House to vote on a measure to release the Epstein files.</p><p>"Get your people in and stop covering up for the pedophiles<i>,</i>" shouted Gallego at Johnson during their confrontation in the corridor.</p><p>"That’s ridiculous," responded Johnson. </p><p>"There's nobody covering up for pedophiles," chirped Lawler from the back of the scrum. "So knock it the hell off."</p><p>Johnson denies the Grijalva holdup is about the Epstein files. </p><p>"We'll schedule it, I guess, as soon as she wants. It has nothing to do with it," said Johnson. </p><p>But Grijalva wrote to the Speaker last week demanding the House swear her in immediately. And the House still hasn’t sworn her in.</p><p>Circumstances were different this spring when the House GOP majority dwindled to a net seat of one. Republicans needed as many votes as they could muster to pass parliamentary frameworks for the Big, Beautiful Bill. Johnson swore-in Reps. Randy Fine, R-Fla., and Jimmy Patronis, R-Fla., a day after they won special elections.</p><p>"These guys worked hard and they earned the position," said Johnson when he met with them back in April. "These gentlemen are going to come in and help us deliver the America First agenda." </p><p>Johnson noted that swearing-in Fine and Patronis made "the margin a little more comfortable" for House Republicans.</p><p>So Johnson is keeping the House out of session for now. House Democrats are returning to Capitol Hill this week to make a point of Johnson keeping the House out of session during the shutdown. Regardless, pouring everyone back into the Capitol would likely trigger the Congressional equivalent of a line brawl. </p><p>There are unwritten rules about hockey fights. You don’t sucker punch someone. You don’t knee your opponent. You generally square off in a fight with someone in your same weight class. In hockey, both sides warm up on their own side of the red line before the game and between periods. Violation of that code might trigger a big brawl.</p><p>Lawmakers from both sides seemingly left their own side of the rink to pick fights with the other side. Gallego and Kelly outside the Speaker’s Office. Lawler outside Jeffries’ news conference.</p><p>But lawmakers are apparently ignoring these unwritten rules. The government shutdown soon enters its third week and everyone is dropping their gloves.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Penn State athletic director explains decision to fire head coach James Franklin: 'I felt it was time'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Penn State Nittany Lions athletic director Pat Kraft made the decision to fire head football coach James Franklin, and he told reporters on Monday that it wasn’t just the three-game losing streak that led to the decision.</p><p>Franklin’s departure is a shock to college football, as the leader in the locker room since 2014 parts ways with the Nittany Lions, who will have a whopping $50 million buyout to pay him. </p><p>Kraft said he was "looking at everything" after Penn State’s loss to Northwestern, 22-21, on Saturday. </p><p>"I felt after sitting down Saturday and looking at everything, at where we were in terms of the best interest of the athletes and where the program was going that we had to make the hard decision," Kraft told reporters, via Sports Illustrated. "Looking at where the program was, where it is, and where we want to be, I felt that there was no other course. I felt it was time."</p><p>This is a Penn State program that was ranked No. 2 in the country before the season started. They went 3-0 to begin, but have been in a free fall since. It came to a head against an unranked Northwestern team, as fans’ chants to fire Franklin roared even louder than they were when Oregon went into Beaver Stadium and handed them their first loss. </p><p>Kraft and Franklin have had a longstanding friendship as well as a professional relationship, making his firing hard on many levels. </p><p>"James Franklin is a good friend who has always carried himself with dignity, and represented Penn State with absolute class," Kraft explained. "We are all fortunate to have had James Franklin to lead this program for more than a decade and we wish nothing but the best for him and his family."</p><p>The Nittany Lions will be led by Terry Smith, Franklin’s assistant coach, who has been named the interim head coach. </p><p>Franklin took over as Penn State’s head coach before the 2014 season after leading Vanderbilt for three seasons in the same role. He was in his 12th season at Penn State, having brought the team to the College Football Playoff semifinals last season. </p><p>As the team’s head coach, Franklin was 104-45. </p><p>Looking ahead, Penn State will be without quarterback Drew Allar for the remainder of the season due to a leg injury suffered in the loss to Northwestern. They will head into a matchup with Iowa next week, but the schedule gets much harder from there. </p><p>Penn State will see No. 1 Ohio State on Nov. 1, No. 7 Indiana on Nov. 8, and four or more losses would keep them out of the College Football Playoff for this season. </p><p><i>Fox News’ Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.</i></p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Israeli-American actress Natalie Portman expressed excitement Monday over the prospect of peace between Israel and Gaza.</p><p>While at the Lumière Film Festival in Lyon, France, Portman remarked that it was a "momentous day" as the two-year war between Israel and Hamas appeared to be ending, and the remaining living hostages were being released from Gaza. </p><p>"To see the end of the war today and the release and the swap of the prisoners and the hostages is really a momentous day," the "Star Wars" actress said.</p><p>Former President Donald Trump recently brokered a peace deal between Israel and Hamas that went into effect this week.</p><p>The prisoner exchange began Monday, with Hamas releasing the final 20 living hostages in exchange for Israel freeing about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, according to the Associated Press and Reuters. The swap is part of Trump’s 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the conflict and rebuilding Gaza. So far, only four of the 28 presumed-dead hostages have been recovered.</p><p>Portman attended the festival as a guest of honor, with the Lumière Film Festival recognizing her Hollywood career.

<div class="article-title">Watchdog group seeks probe of Comey, Letitia James cases</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Former federal ethics officials who served in Republican and Democratic administrations are asking the Justice Department's inspector general to investigate the prosecutions of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p><p>In a letter obtained by CBS News, ethics officials who worked in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations urged a formal review of interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Lindsey Halligan's decision to prosecute Comey and James.    </p><p>They sent their request Tuesday to Acting Justice Department Inspector General William Blier, writing, "Ms. Halligan pursued these indictments to fulfill President Donald J. Trump's longstanding personal vendetta against Mr. Comey and Ms. James, we are facing a turning point in our democracy and some of the most egregious examples of vindictive and meritless prosecution that our nation has ever seen."</p><p>The letter was written by leaders of the Democracy Defenders Fund, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that has frequently been critical of the Trump administration.	</p><p>The group is led by Norm Eisen, former ethics official for President Barack Obama; Richard Painter, a former associate counsel to President George W. Bush; and Virginia Canter, a former White House associate counsel to Presidents Bill Clinton and Obama.</p>
<p>Their letter also said, "A president should never order prosecutions of his enemies. That happens in Putin's Russia, and it has happened in other dictatorships, but not here–until now." </p><p>Comey and Mr. Trump have had a contentious relationship for years. Comey, who was FBI director when Mr. Trump took office in 2017, <span class="link">was fired</span> later that year by the president. Initially, the White House indicated he had been ousted over his <span class="link">handling</span> of the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email server, but the president later told NBC News' Lester Holt that he had the FBI's Russia investigation on his mind and had terminated Comey because of "<span class="link">this Russia thing</span> with Trump and Russia." </p><p>That firing ultimately set into motion <span class="link">special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation</span> into allegations that <span class="link">Russia interfered</span> in the 2016 presidential election and that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced those allegations as a "hoax." Mueller's probe found that Russia interfered in the election and several Trump campaign officials had contacts with Russians, but did not establish that campaign staff illegally conspired with the Russian government.</p><p>For his part, Comey has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump since his firing, calling him "morally unfit" to be president <span class="link">in a 2018 interview</span>.</p>
<p>The Democracy Defenders Fund also contended that "prosecutors should never be fired for refusing to bring charges they conclude are unfounded, even if the president orders them to do so. Yet that appears to be just what President Trump has done in order to charge Mr. Comey and Ms. James."</p><p>The criminal cases were filed against Comey and James less than three weeks after President Trump called for their prosecution in a post on social media. </p><p>The acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who had been appointed to the position by Mr. Trump, resigned after he did not bring prosecutions of Comey and James, and the president announced he had been fired. A Trump White House aide, Lindsey Halligan, was then installed as acting U.S. attorney and within days secured grand jury indictments against Comey and James — with prosecutors charging Comey less than a week before the statute of limitations ran out.  </p><p>Halligan has defended both of the prosecutions. In the hours after James's indictment last week, Halligan said in a statement, "No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust."  </p><p>After charging Comey, Halligan said, "The charges as alleged in this case represent a breach of the public trust at an extraordinary level,"</p><p>Comey is charged with making a false statement and obstruction of Congress, for allegedly lying to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020 when he denied that he had authorized someone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports. Comey has denied any wrongdoing. </p><p>During an arraignment proceeding last week, Comey's defense attorney told a judge that Comey would seek a dismissal of the case next week, arguing the case is an unlawful vindictive prosecution against one of the president's critics.</p>
<p>The Democracy Defenders Fund's request for a federal review of Halligan's cases also argued, "The same pattern has now been repeated a second time in as many weeks with respect to another victim of President Trump's wrath. Ms. Halligan's prosecution of Letitia James on two counts of 'bank fraud' and a 'false statement' appears to be a further attempt to fulfill President Trump's personal vendetta against his political enemies."</p><p>"Trump's animus against Ms. James stems from having successfully brought a years-long civil fraud case against the Trump Organization, which included judgments against President Trump and two of his sons and imposed a court monitor with limits on their ability to conduct business in New York," the fund's letter continued.</p><p>James is scheduled to appear in court on Oct. 24, to answer to charges of mortgage fraud and false statement in connection with a Norfolk, Virginia, home in 2020. James has also denied wrongdoing.</p><p>The Office of the Justice Department Inspector General is on furlough because of the shutdown and did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.</p>

<div class="article-title">1 dead, 2 missing after severe Alaska flooding; "absolute devastation"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>One person was dead and two were missing in western Alaska on Monday after the remnants of Typhoon Halong brought hurricane-force winds and ravaging storm surges and floodwaters over the weekend  that <span class="link">swept some homes away</span>, authorities said. More than 50 people had been rescued - some plucked from rooftops. </p><p>Officials warned of a long road to recovery and a need for continued support for the hardest-hit communities with winter just around the corner. A U.S. Coast Guard official, Capt. Christopher Culpepper, described the situation in the villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok as "absolute devastation." </p><p>Alaska State Troopers said at least 51 people and two dogs were rescued in Kipnuk and Kwigillingok after the storm system walloped the communities. Both areas saw significant storm surge, according to the National Weather Service. </p><p>A woman was found dead and two people remained unaccounted for in Kwigillingok, troopers said. The agency earlier said it was working to confirm secondhand reports of people who were unaccounted for in Kipnuk but IT SAID late Monday that troopers had determined no one there was missing.</p><p>Troopers said it and several other agencies were searching by boat and from the air for the missing people. Troopers said they also sent a helicopter from Fairbanks to aid in the search and deliver generators and fuel to the communities.</p>
<h2>Coping as storm was hitting  </h2><p>According to the nonprofit Coastal Villages Region Fund, most of the residents in both communities had taken shelter in local schools.  </p><p>In addition to housing concerns, residents impacted by the system across the region reported power outages, a lack of running water, subsistence foods stocked in freezers ruined and damage to home-heating stoves. That damage could make the winter difficult in remote communities where people store food from hunting and fishing to help make it through the season. </p><p>Jamie Jenkins, 42, who lives in another hard-hit community, Napakiak, said the storm was "the worst I've ever seen." She described howling winds and fast-rising waters Sunday morning.  </p><p>Her mother - whose nearby home shifted on its foundation - and a neighbor whose home flooded came over to Jenkins' place. They tried to wait out the storm, she said, but when the waters reached their top stairs, they got in a boat and evacuated to the school.  </p>
<p>Jenkins said "practically the whole community" was there. The men in town gathered their boats and went house to house to pick up anyone else who was still in their homes, she said. </p><p>Adaline Pete, who lives in another community, Kotlik, said she had never experienced winds so strong. An unoccupied house next door flipped over but she said her family felt safe in their home.</p><h2>Climate funds in doubt  </h2><p>During a news conference organized by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, Alaska's two U.S. senators, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, said they would continue to focus on <span class="link">climate resilience</span> and infrastructure funds for Alaska. Sullivan said it was the congressional delegation's job to ensure the Trump administration and their colleagues understood the importance of such funds.  </p><p>Earlier this year, the Federal Emergency Management Agency <span class="link">said it would end a program aimed at mitigating disaster risks</span>. The decision is being challenged in court.  </p><p>Murkowski said erosion mitigation projects take time to complete. "But our reality is, we are seeing these storms coming ... certainly on a more frequent basis, and the intensity that we're seeing seems to be accumulating as well, and so the time to act on it is now because it's going to take us some time to get these in place," she said of such projects.  </p><p>About 380 people live in Kwigillingok, a predominately Alaska Native community on the western shore of Kuskokwim Bay and near the mouth of the Kuskokwim River. A report prepared for the local tribe in 2022 by the Alaska Institute for Justice said the frequency and severity of flooding in the low-lying region had increased in recent years. The report listed relocation of the community as an urgent need.  </p><p>Erosion and melting permafrost pose threats to infrastructure and in some cases entire communities in Alaska, which is experiencing the impacts of <span class="link">climate change</span>.</p>

<div class="article-title">Couple killed in fiery small plane crash on Route 195 in Dartmouth</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A husband and wife were killed when a small plane crashed onto Route 195 in Dartmouth, Massachusetts Monday morning, police said. Both sides of the highway were shut down for hours.</p><p>The fuselage of the fixed-wing, single engine plane ended up on the grassy median around 8:15 a.m. and burst into flames, according to Massachusetts State Police. Other parts of the plane were found in the surrounding woods.</p>
<p>A woman who was driving on the highway was "impacted by a portion of the crashed aircraft," Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn said. She was driven to a hospital with injuries that are not considered to be life-threatening.</p><h2>Plane crash victims identified</h2><p>The district attorney identified the victims as 68-year-old Thomas Perkins and his wife, 66-year-old Agatha Perkins. Both are from Middletown, Rhode Island.</p><p>They were found in the fuselage of the plane in the median and pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>Rhode Island State Senator Lou DiPalma represents Middletown and Newport and said the couple is well-known in the area. "This is a big loss to the community and tragic of what happened," DiPalma told WPRI-TV. </p><p>DiPalma said the couple was a part of Kirby-Perkins Construction, the Middletown-based company known for their work in historic restoration and custom homes. </p><p>His kids went to school with the Perkins' children at St. Philomena School in Portsmouth. </p><p>"They were always there and always giving quite a bit back to the school and you always knew they were around," DiPalma said.  </p>
<h2>NTSB investigating crash</h2><p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is looking into what caused the crash. The agency said the Socata TBM-700 aircraft had flown out of New Bedford Regional Airport. According to Flightradar24, the plane was enroute to Kenosha, Wisconsin. </p>
<p>A photo and video on social media showed the wreckage in flames on the highway in the rain. There was also a wrecked car in the median that belonged to the injured driver.</p><p>In a statement, New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell said officials at the airport are prepared to support the investigation led by the NTSB. </p><p>"I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in this morning's tragic plane crash in North Dartmouth," Mayor Mitchell said. "I appreciate the swift and skillful response by New Bedford's emergency responders, as well as the Massachusetts State Police and other state and municipal officials. I am grateful that the crash miraculously did not result in serious injuries to motorists on Interstate 195." </p>
<p>Jen Jacobs was driving on the highway when she saw fiery crash. </p><p>"I look over and I'm like, that doesn't look like a car. And then, I see the flames. And then I see the flames going all the way across to 195 westbound," Jacobs said. </p><p>She watched as one first responder doused the fuselage with a fire extinguisher. "I looked at the plane and I thought, nothing good is going to come out of this. It was in pieces," Jacobs said.  </p>
<p>All lanes of travel except the left-most eastbound lane were reopened in time for the evening commute.</p><p>"Troopers will remain at the site overnight to ensure the integrity of the scene until Federal Investigators arrive to conduct their investigation tomorrow," state police said.</p><p>It's not clear yet if the weather was a factor. A <span class="link">nor'easter</span> has been rolling through Massachusetts since Sunday, bringing heavy rain and strong wind to the region. </p><p>Dartmouth is about 57 miles south of Boston and 28 miles southeast of Providence, Rhode Island.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The names of <span class="link">16 people</span> who are presumed dead in the <span class="link">massive blast at a Tennessee explosives plant</span> last week have been released. </p><p>Their remains have not been identified, as authorities continue search efforts following the Friday explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems in McEwen, but Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis and Hickman County Sheriff Jason Craft on Monday read out loud the names of the victims.</p><p>"I know some of you have probably seen that information through Facebook or whatever, but we want to confirm with you the names of those individual souls that we've been talking about," Davis said during a news conference.</p><p>The victims are: Jason Adams, Erick Anderson, Billy Baker, Adam Boatman, Christopher Clark, Mindy Clifton, James Cook, Reyna Gillahan, LaTeisha Mays, Jeremy Moore, Melinda Rainey, Melissa Stanford, Trenton Stewart, Rachel Woodall, Steven Wright and Donald Yowell.</p><p>Their ages have not been confirmed. </p>
<p>Tennessee authorities are utilizing rapid DNA testing to help identify the remains, but due to extensive damage and hazardous materials, the process is "proceeding slowly and methodically," the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said Monday. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation. </p>
<p>"As part of the state's process, once a loved one has been positively identified—usually through DNA comparison with a known close relative—the county medical examiner will issue a death certificate," TEMA said in a statement.</p><p>The small community of McEwen, which has fewer than 2,000 residents, gathered at churches over the weekend to mourn the loss of life.</p><p>"These families ... their kids would play ball together, go to school together," senior Pastor Tim Farris of Hurricane Free Will Baptist Church told CBS affiliate WTVF following a vigil.</p><p>Janie Brown, one of the attendees, spoke with WTVF about the people she knows who were directly impacted.</p>
<p>"I work with one of the ladies, her son was involved, and another one, her son was involved," Brown said, adding that she feels the reality of what happened hasn't set in yet.</p><p>"I'll be there for 'em. If it's just listening to 'em or just holding their hand. That's all I can do," she said.</p><p>The explosion took place around 7:45 a.m. CT on Friday, authorities have said. The blast occurred in one of the eight buildings on the campus. Video from the scene showed damaged vehicles and charred debris scattered around the area.</p><p>Accurate Energetic Systems specializes in the development, manufacture, handling and storage of products and explosives for military, aerospace and commercial demolition markets, according to its website. The company also tests those explosives on the 1,300-acre campus. </p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A teen in Hoffman Estates was thrown to the ground by what appeared to be a federal agent. She and two of her friends were detained for hours before they were released over the weekend.</p><p>Her parents are speaking out after they say their daughter, 18-year-old Evelyn, is still shaken from the experience.</p><p>Evelyn's parents said her boyfriend got a call that ICE was in his neighborhood. They went to warn people who live there and recorded the officers. This led to a violent arrest, Homeland Security said they did not take part in.</p><p>Sirens and undercover law enforcement cars flooded this Hoffman Estates neighborhood on Friday.</p><p>The incident captured on video shows Evelyn getting pulled out of the passenger seat. She is then thrown to the ground, all while saying she is not resisting arrest. All while the officer handcuffed her and appeared to put a knee on her back.</p>
<p>"I couldn't protect my child," Gerado said.</p><p>Evelyn's parents, Gerardo and Jazmin, said those images are something they cannot get out of their minds.</p><p>"They were telling them they were U.S. citizens, and they didn't care. It was very scary to see that video," Jazmin said.</p><p>They say their daughter and her two friends were taken in cars to the Hoffman Estates Police Department parking lot, where they sat for hours.</p>
<p>"While we were there, we were asking when they were going to be released and what were going to be the charges. Trying to figure out some kind of information because they weren't giving us any information," Gerado said.</p><p>At that point, they say they didn't know if they would see their daughter again. They were all released after hours of waiting, but there is confusion about which department these officers are with.</p><p>In a tweet, the Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin commented on Evelyn's arrest video, saying, "Imagine being so desperate to demonize law enforcement you post a video from a burglary arrest Chicago police made over a year ago. This isn't even ICE."</p><p>Hoffman Estates police, however, said ICE was in the area on Friday. </p><p>A statement sent to CBS News Chicago reads in part, "the only interaction we had with ICE was when they came to the police department to file a police report reference an incident that occurred during their enforcement. They ultimately decided to complete the report this week with us and have not completed that yet."</p><p>Evelyn's parents said they want someone to hold accountability.</p><p>"Isn't the government supposed to protect and serve? Isn't the law officers are supposed to protect and serve? Why would we lie about this?" Gerado said.</p>
<p>Evelyn's parents said they are taking legal action.</p><p>CBS News Chicago reached out to Homeland Security to confirm if agents were here in Hoffman Estates on Friday, but did not hear back.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Letitia James, New York's indicted attorney general, spoke at a campaign rally for mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani in her first public appearance since the Justice Department <span class="link">charged her with bank fraud</span>. </p><p>James, a longtime foe of President Trump, received a standing ovation from thousands of supporters attending the Democratic nominee's event Monday night at the United Palace Theater in Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood. </p><p>James did not mention Mr. Trump by name, but remained defiant in her remarks. </p><p>"I will not bow, I will not break, I will not bend, I will not capitulate. I will not give in. I will not give up," James said. "You come for me, you gotta come through all of us." </p>
<p>James was <span class="link">indicted</span> on one count of bank fraud and another count of making a false statement, stemming from a house she bought in Virginia. She dismissed the charges as <span class="link">"baseless"</span> shortly after they were announced last week. </p>
<p>At the rally, James wasted no time appearing to take aim at the president. </p><p>"I won't give up and I won't give in. So we have no time to linger and focus on pettiness and revenge. We've gotta press on, press forward, continue the journey, claim the victory ... and so I fear no man," she said.</p><p><span class="link">Mamdani</span>, the Queens assemblyman who won the Democratic primary, has been a champion of James since the beginning. </p><p>"For years, you have fought the good fight for New Yorkers, and now it's our chance to fight for you," Mamdani said. </p>
<p>Mamdani maintains <span class="link">a double-digit lead</span> in polling over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa, who did not appear on the campaign trail Monday. But all three candidates did <span class="link">release statements</span> Monday praising the Israel-Hamas peace plan and release of hostages. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for James said her campaign for reelection next year has raised about $1 million since her indictment, mostly from new donors.</p><p>James is scheduled to make her first appearance in a Virginia federal court on Oct. 24. </p>

Roy Mundy was one of the passengers on the ferry who didn't hesitate to help. </p><p>"Out of nowhere one person stood up and said, 'man overboard' and it was really intense because every single person on the boat shot up immediately," Mundy said. </p><p>Police are still investigating how the man got in the water. </p><p>"It was horrendous out there so I'm so happy that they found him, we all wanted him to be found but you have to be honest, it looked bleak it was so dangerous out there," Mundy said. </p>
<p>Good Samaritans and crewmembers went out on the windy deck, throwing life rings to the man, and trying to keep their eyes on him.</p><p>"It was very shocking," Mundy said. "I saw a father out there who was trying to spot him while their son was by the door crying trying to get the father back in because he was scared he was going to fall over, it was very intense."  </p><p>Falmouth police are investigating the incident.</p>

<div class="article-title">5 hospitalized after helicopter crashes in busy oceanfront area of Huntington Beach</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Five people, including a child, were hospitalized when a helicopter crashed in the Southern California city of Huntington Beach on Saturday afternoon. </p><p>It happened just after 2 p.m. local time near a parking lot off Pacific Coast Highway, between Beach Boulevard and Twin Dolphins Drive, according to Huntington Beach firefighters. </p><p>City officials tell CBS News that the two people on the helicopter were safely pulled from the wreckage. Three pedestrians on the street were also injured in the incident, and all five people were taken to the hospital for treatment. None of their conditions was known.</p>
<p>Police closed PCH between Huntington Street and Beach Boulevard at around 3 p.m., as they began to investigate the crash. They asked people to avoid the area and use alternate routes for at least several hours after the closure was put into place. </p><p>A dramatic video posted on social media shows the helicopter spinning several times before crashing into palm trees and the outdoor stairway of the pedestrian bridge that runs over PCH to the Hyatt Regency Huntington Beach Resort and Spa. </p><p>Other video footage shows an object falling from the helicopter moments before it plummeted from the sky. </p>
<p>With SkyCal over the scene, scattered debris was seen in the beach access parking lot, a large part of which was blocked off by police tape. The tail of the aircraft broke off in the crash, with the rest of the helicopter still wedged between the staircase and palm trees as of 4:30 p.m.</p><p>There were several other small helicopters parked in the parking lot near where the crash happened, just in front of the Hyatt Regency and Waterfront Beach Resort. An "exclusive helicopter landing party" was being hosted by MD Helicopters at the Offshore 9 Rooftop Lounge on Saturday afternoon, where attendees were invited to "watch helicopters arrive from a bird's eye view." The landing party was scheduled ahead of the Cars 'N Copters On the Coast main event on Sunday.</p><p>Event organizers said that the event was not going to be canceled. </p><p>"We are sending our prayers out to all involved in the unfortunate incident today," said a statement. "Our plan for now is to move forward with our event tomorrow, Sunday, October 12th. We will advise everyone at the earliest possible opportunity if that plan changes."</p>
<p>Witnesses said that the helicopter appeared to dip towards the bridge before it lost control and crashed. </p><p>"You can hear this odd sound that didn't sound right," said Kevin Bullat, who saw the scene unfold. "I looked out and I see the helicopter spiraling out of control. ... My friend saw shrapnel, or just debris, catapulting across PCH."</p><p>It's unclear what caused the helicopter to crash. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have been notified of the crash, city officials said. They believe that an investigation report will be ready within 30 days. </p><p>The helicopter was a Bell 222, which is powered by two turboshaft engines, and was manufactured in 1980. Though officials haven't yet identified any of the victims, CBS News Los Angeles has learned that the helicopter was registered to a man named Eric Nixon. </p><p>An Instagram account named Nixon Helicopters posted to say that both the pilot and passenger were safe and hospitalized following the crash. Other friends of Nixon's also posted on social media, claiming that he broke some ribs and fractured his spine. </p><p>The wreckage was cleared from the parking lot on Monday afternoon. The area was reopened to the public shortly after, but city officials said that the pedestrian bridge would be closed for sometime due to necessary repairs. </p>

<div class="article-title">4 arrests made following mass shooting that killed 6 in Mississippi, FBI says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Four people have been arrested in connection with <span class="link">a weekend shooting</span> that left six dead and more than a dozen injured in a small Mississippi town, the FBI announced Monday.</p><p>Teviyon L. Powell, 29; William Bryant, 29, and Morgan Lattimore, 25, have been charged with capital murder, while Latoya A. Powell, 44, has been charged with attempted murder in the mass shooting, a spokesperson for the FBI's Jackson Field Office confirmed to CBS News.</p><p>It was not immediately clear whether the suspects have attorneys. The Associated Press left a voicemail with the Washington County Public Defender's Office asking if its attorneys are representing the defendants.</p><p>"Other arrests are pending as this investigation continues," the spokesperson said, urging anyone with information about the shooting in the rural northwest Delta region to report tips to the FBI.</p><p>The shooting happened early Saturday morning. It came as people celebrated homecoming weekend in downtown Leland shortly after a high school football game, and was the deadliest of several shootings across Mississippi over the weekend.</p>
<h2>Gun violence reports in Mississippi</h2><p>Another shooting left two people dead at Heidelberg High School on Saturday. It also occurred during a homecoming game. Other shootings were reported at two Mississippi universities on Saturday as those schools celebrated their homecoming weekends.</p><p>Authorities have not disclosed a possible motive for Friday night's shooting in Leland, but the FBI said the gunfire appears to have been "sparked by a disagreement among several individuals."</p><p>Four of the victims died at the scene, where abandoned shoes were left and blood stained the pavement of a downtown street the following day.</p><p>Witness Camish Hopkins described seeing people wounded and bleeding and four people dead on the ground. "It was the most horrific scene I'd ever seen," Hopkins told The AP.</p>
<p>The shooting in Leland was the 14th mass killing in 2025, according to The Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University Mass Killing Database. The database tracks all homicides in the U.S. since 2006 in which four or more people were killed intentionally within a 24-hour period, not including any offender.</p><p>Elsewhere, in the small town of Heidelberg on the east side of the state, the bodies of two people, including a pregnant woman, were found on a high school campus Friday night. That shooting happened the same evening Heidelberg High School played its homecoming football game, according to police and Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves. Police have not said exactly when the gunfire occurred or how close it was to the stadium.</p><p>An 18-year-old man was arrested and charged with two counts of murder and illegally having a gun on a school campus in the Heidelberg shooting, Jasper County Jail records show. </p><p>Heidelberg, a town of about 640 residents, is about 85 miles southeast of the state capital of Jackson.</p><p>On Saturday evening, three people were also found with apparent gunshot wounds on the Alcorn State University campus in Claiborne County, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation said. One of the victims died, the agency said. Police found the victims after a call reporting shots fired in the area of the industrial technology building. No arrests were announced.</p><p>The shooting happened after a crowd of more than 7,000 watched Alcorn State defeat Lincoln University of Oakland, California, in the Mississippi school's homecoming game Saturday afternoon.</p><p>In Jackson, police responded around 7 p.m. Saturday to the tailgating area of Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium, where Jackson State University hosted Alabama State University. A juvenile had been shot in the abdomen and was taken to a hospital, police said. No arrests were announced, and few other details about that shooting were immediately available.</p>

<div class="article-title">Police records reveal new details about Dallas ICE facility shooter</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The parents of the 29-year-old gunman who <span class="link">opened fire on a Dallas immigration facility</span> in September told police their son was "completely normal" before he moved to Washington state and returned home several years ago, believing he had "radiation sickness" and was "allergic to plastic," according to newly released records. </p><p>Joshua Jahn had begun wearing cotton gloves to avoid contact with plastic and practiced target shooting with a newly purchased rifle in Oklahoma a month before the deadly rooftop attack on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building, according to a report written by a Fairview Police Department officer. </p><p>Jahn <span class="link">killed two detainees</span> and wounded another before taking his own life in the Sept. 24 shooting.</p><p>The two deceased victims were identified as Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, 37, from El Salvador, and Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez, 32, from Mexico. Garcia-Hernandez was shot at least eight times during the attack and later died at Parkland Hospital after being taken off life support, according to the League of United Latin American Citizens. </p><p>The wounded victim, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina, was eventually released from the hospital, according to a Department of Homeland Security official.  </p>
<p>The records, obtained by The Associated Press through an open records request, reveal no clues about what may have motivated the attack. Federal authorities said previously that Jahn wrote "ANTI-ICE" on a bullet and left handwritten notes indicating he wanted to ambush and terrorize ICE agents. </p><p>The new records show that on the day of the shooting, Jahn's parents told the FBI he would "occasionally discuss current events" with his mother but rarely engaged in conversations. His parents said he was a "loner" who was "obsessed" with artificial intelligence technology. The parents, Andrew and Sharon Jahn, did not immediately respond Monday to text and phone messages from The AP. </p><p>The documents portray Jahn as an unemployed, friendless young man who had withdrawn into playing computer games in his bedroom at his parents' home in a Dallas suburb. Jahn was not diagnosed with or treated for any mental or physical disorders, his parents said. </p><p>Neither the police nor FBI immediately responded to a request for comment. The FBI said only that because of the government shutdown, it was focused on national security, violations of federal law and essential public safety functions.</p>
<p>Jahn had been "completely normal" until he moved back from Washington state in the past five years, his parents said. He had previously taken classes at a Texas community college on and off for years before driving across the country to answer an online advertisement for a seasonal job harvesting marijuana at a legal cannabis farm in Washington. Jahn appeared directionless and slept in his car for months, the farm's owner, Ryan Sanderson, previously told The AP. </p><p>After returning from Washington because he could not retain a job, Jahn's parents told the FBI he believed he was "allergic to plastic" and sought to avoid direct skin contact with the material. The county where he worked in Washington state was one of the sites for the secret Manhattan Project to develop atomic bombs. And they said their son became convinced that while in Washington, he had been "exposed to radiation from a nearby facility and was suffering from radiation sickness." </p><p>Photographs from the scene of the shooting show a car affixed with a map depicting radioactive fallout in the U.S. </p><p>Records suggest his family life was far from harmonious. Jahn's father had put pressure on his older brother to find a job or join the military after high school, and his mother called the police when the brother failed to show up to a meeting with an Army recruiter to sign enlistment papers in 2014, police records show. </p><p>Jahn's mother called police on his sister one morning when she slept in rather than go to high school, moving out of the home for weeks as a teenager and once spray painting an expletive on the driveway of the family's home.</p><p>But the Jahns financially supported Joshua, their youngest son, as he stayed in his second-floor bedroom and played computer games.</p><p>About a month before Jahn attacked the ICE facility, he went with his father to practice shooting at their property in Durant, Oklahoma, where they are building a new home. While Jahn's father owned several guns, he was surprised to see his son pull an "old rifle" out of his car. Jahn told his father he had "recently" purchased the gun online, police records show.</p>
<p>According to the records, his mother told the FBI she had "no idea" her son owned a gun.</p><p>The FBI said previously that Jahn legally obtained the bolt-action rifle used in the shooting. But police records don't say whether that was the gun Jahn used while target shooting.</p><p>Analysts with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which focuses on hate and extremism, working as part of a program organized by the Center for Internet Security, said it found that Jahn played games online under the username "Frank Hoenniker." The username is apparently a misspelled reference to a cold and calculating character in author Kurt Vonnegut's 1963 satirical novel, "Cat's Cradle," about politics, religion and nuclear proliferation. </p><p>Steam, a game distribution platform, shows Jahn logged more than 11,000 hours on first-person shooter and survival games. </p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>SpaceX launched its <span class="link">Super Heavy-Starship</span> rocket on Monday for the 11th time, marking another successful test flight that built upon previous launches.</p><p><span class="link">Elon Musk</span>, SpaceX founder and CEO, briefly made an appearance on the company's livestream ahead of the launch, saying it was the first time that he was going to be outside to watch the rocket. </p><p>"Normally I'm in mission control and stuff," Musk told the livestream hosts. "It's really going to be much more visceral."</p><p>Shortly after, Starship — the <span class="link">biggest and most powerful rocket</span> ever built — thundered into the evening sky from the southern tip of Texas. The booster peeled away and made a controlled entry into the Gulf as planned, with the spacecraft skimming space before descending into the Indian Ocean. Nothing was being recovered.</p>
<p>It was the 11th test flight for a full-scale Starship, which Musk intends to use to send people to Mars. NASA's need is more immediate. The space agency cannot land astronauts on the moon by decade's end without the 403-foot Starship, the reusable vehicle meant to get them from lunar orbit down to the surface and back up.</p>
<p>The previous test flight in August — a success after <span class="link">a string of explosive failures</span> — followed a similar path with similar goals. More maneuvering was built in this time, especially for the spacecraft. SpaceX planned a series of tests during the spacecraft's entry over the Indian Ocean as practice for future landings back at the launch site.</p>
<p>Like before, Starship carried up eight mock satellites mimicking SpaceX's Starlinks. The entire flight was meant to last just over an hour, originating from Starbase near the Mexican border. </p><p>SpaceX is modifying its Cape Canaveral launch sites to accommodate Starships, in addition to the much smaller Falcon rockets used to transport astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station for NASA.</p>

<div class="article-title">What's next in the Gaza peace plan after Israeli hostages freed</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The next <span class="link">phase of the Gaza peace plan</span> brokered by President Trump moved forward significantly on Monday as Hamas released all of the <span class="link">20 living Israeli hostages</span> in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, and as more aid started to flow into the Palestinian territory after two years of war. </p><p>The steps are crucial parts of <span class="link">President Trump's 20-point peace plan</span>, and they came three days after a <span class="link">ceasefire</span> took effect in Gaza and Israeli troops pulled back to a pre-determined line.</p><p>World leaders, including <span class="link">Mr. Trump</span>, met in Egypt on Monday for a summit on the future of Gaza and the broader Middle East. </p><p>But the situation remains fragile, with major questions over what comes next still to be answered.</p><h2>Negotiations over next steps</h2><p>Israel and Hamas have little trust in each other, and it took a number of failed, indirect negotiations in Doha, Qatar's capital, to get to the truce, with Egypt and Qatar acting as meditators.</p>
<p>The initial phases of the agreement called for: the release of the final hostages held by Hamas, living and dead; the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel; a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza; and a partial pullback by Israeli forces from Gaza's main cities. </p><p>Egypt's foreign minister said on Monday that it was crucial that Israel and Hamas fully implement the first phase of the deal so that the parties can start negotiations on the second phase. As of Monday evening, all living hostages were back in Israel, but the remains of many of the slain captives remained in Gaza.</p><p>"We're very committed to [the peace deal]," Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told CBS News on Monday. "The agreement specifically says 72 hours for when IDF redeploys on the new line ... That is past already, and not all hostages have returned yet, so we understand what we're dealing with."</p><p>Later phases of the plan will have to address thornier issues such as Gaza's postwar governance, Israel's demand that Hamas disarm, which the group has rejected, and Palestinian demands for a state, which the current Israeli government has rejected.</p>
<p>Negotiations over those issues could break down, and Israel has hinted it may resume military operations if its demands are not met.</p><p>President Trump's plan to end the war also stipulates that regional and international partners will work to develop the core of a new Palestinian security force. </p><p>Reconstruction will be another major challenge. The World Bank, and a postwar plan proposed by Egypt, estimates that at least $53 billion will be needed to rebuild the shattered Palestinian territory. Egypt plans to host a future reconstruction conference.</p><h2>Will Hamas disarm?</h2><p>Among the most difficult issues is Israel's insistence that a weakened Hamas completely disarm. Hamas refuses to do that and wants to ensure Israel pulls its troops completely out of Gaza.</p><p>So far, the Israeli military has withdrawn from Gaza City, the southern city of Khan Younis and other areas, but it remains in control of about 53% of the enclave, according to Israeli officials. Troops remain in most of the southern city of Rafah, towns of Gaza's far north, and a wide strip along the length of Gaza's border with Israel.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that Israel was "tightening the noose around Hamas from all sides," and vowed that Gaza would be demilitarized after the Israeli government approved the peace plan, which it did hours later.</p><p>"Hamas will disarm and Gaza will be demilitarized. If this can be achieved the easy way, all the better; if not, it will be achieved the hard way," Netanyahu said, addressing reporters.</p>
<h2>Who will govern Gaza?</h2><p>Israel and Hamas have not agreed on Gaza's postwar governance.</p><p>Under the U.S. plan, an international body is supposed to govern the Palestinian territory, overseeing Palestinian technocrats running day-to-day affairs. Hamas and other factions would not have any role in Gaza's governance.</p><p>The plan envisions an eventual role for Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas' Palestinian Authority — something Netanyahu has long opposed. But it requires the authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, to first undergo a sweeping reform program, and it does not provide any timeline for the process.</p><p>Hamas has said Gaza's government should be worked out among Palestinians.</p><p>The deal also recognizes an independent Palestinian state as, "the aspiration of the Palestinian people," but it's unclear if or when discussions on statehood could take place, and Israel's Netanyahu has repeatedly said he will not allow the creation of a Palestinian state.</p><h2>International security force </h2><p>The plan calls for an Arab-led international security force in Gaza, along with Palestinian police trained by Egypt and Jordan. It says Israeli forces will leave additional areas as those forces deploy.</p><p>Under the plan, the force would work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with the newly trained Palestinian police forces.</p>
<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said the international force needs a U.N. Security Council resolution to endorse its deployment and mandate as a peacekeeping force.</p><p>About 200 U.S. troops are now in Israel to monitor the ceasefire and the early stages of the peace plan. They were expected to carry out that work in conjunction with partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players.</p>

<div class="article-title">Amazon says it plans to hire 250,000 seasonal workers</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Amazon said Monday it plans to hire 250,000 workers this holiday season as it beefs up staffing to handle what the online retailer expects to be an uptick in orders. </p><p>This marks the third year in a row the e-commerce giant has hired at least a quarter of a million additional part- and full-time workers for the busy holiday shopping period from October through December. </p><p>Amazon's hiring spree comes as the overall number of seasonal jobs this year is expected to fall to its <span class="link">lowest level since 2009</span>, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. The outplacement firm attributes the expected decline in seasonal work to higher business costs from U.S tariffs, ongoing inflationary pressures and more reliance by retailers on automation. </p><p>Amazon said its seasonal jobs pay an average of over $19 an hour. Regular full- and part-time employee wages average $23 an hour, plus benefits, according to the company. </p><p>According to Challenger, retailers may add fewer than 500,000 positions this holiday season, down from roughly 543,000 in the final quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike in past years, retailers have been cautious in announcing their seasonal hiring goals. Department store Kohl's recently said it would add temporary positions, but did not indicate how many. Target also said it would add staff for the holidays without specifying how many additional people it planned to hire. </p><p>The more conservative seasonal hiring plans come as the broader job market is cooling. Employers <span class="link">added only 22,000 </span>jobs in August, while private estimates also point to a <span class="link">slowdown in hiring</span>. </p>

<div class="article-title">20 living hostages were released by Hamas. Here's who they are.</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Their faces stare down from every street corner in Israel on posters now sun-faded and ripped. Their stories, told by anguished family members, are almost as well-known as celebrities. They are civilians and soldiers, fathers and sons. Some were at the Nova music festival, where almost 400 people were killed and dozens kidnapped.</p><p>On Monday, Hamas — which is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and many other nations — <span class="link">released 20 hostages</span> into the custody of the Red Cross, which then brought them to Israel as part of a new ceasefire deal that many hope will signal an end to two years of war in the devastated Gaza Strip. Under the agreement, all living hostages were to be released, as well as the bodies of the deceased.</p><p>Also Monday, two hostages previously thought to be living were confirmed dead.</p>
<p>The war was triggered by the Hamas-led <span class="link">Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel</span>, when some 1,200 people were killed and 251 kidnapped.</p><p>The fighting has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around half the deaths were women and children, and displaced around 90% of the Gaza population of some 2 million. The United Nations and many independent experts consider the ministry's figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties in Gaza.</p><p>Prior to Monday's release, there were 48 hostages held in Gaza, including the body of one soldier from a previous war. Israel had determined that at least 25 of the hostages were killed on Oct. 7, 2023, or died while in captivity. Just before the release of the first hostages under the ceasefire, Hamas informed Israel that two additional hostages were no longer alive, Tamir Nimrodi and Bipin Joshi. Israel had previously expressed "grave concern" over their status.</p>
<p>There is only one remaining female hostage, who Israel believes was killed in captivity.</p><p>Under the ceasefire agreement that took effect last Friday, the remaining hostages were to be released within 72 hours. Israel released around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange, including 250 people serving life sentences for convictions in attacks on Israelis, in addition to 1,700 seized from Gaza during the war and held without charge.</p><p>President Trump <span class="link">met with some of the hostage families</span> at the Knesset before addressing Israeli lawmakers on Monday, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum said. </p><p>Here is a look at the 20 hostages released Monday:</p>
<h2>Gali Berman and Ziv Berman, 28</h2><p>The fraternal twins were taken from their homes in kibbutz Kfar Aza, on the border with Gaza, during the Oct. 7 attack. Seventeen others were also abducted from Kfar Aza, but the Berman twins were the only hostages from the kibbutz who remained in captivity. The family had heard from hostages who returned in a previous deal that, as of February, the brothers were alive but being held separately. Liran Berman, their older brother, said it's the longest the two have ever spent apart. In Kfar Aza, the twins lived in apartments across from each other. Gali is more outgoing, while Ziv is more reserved and shy with a sharp sense of humor, their brother said.</p><h2>Omri Miran, 48</h2><p>Omri Miran was kidnapped from the Nahal Oz kibbutz. During the attack, terrorists held his family, including his two daughters, ages 2 and 6 months, hostage in the kitchen of a neighbor's house and then broadcast it on Facebook Live. Miran and the father of the other family, Tsachi Idan, were kidnapped. Idan's body was released during the last hostage exchange after he was killed in captivity. Lishay Miran Lavi, Miran's wife, said their younger daughter knew "daddy Omri" only through photos and videos, and didn't really understand what a father is. Moshe Lavi, Miran's brother who lives in New York City, <span class="link">told CBS News New York</span> that Miran's sister and two young nieces survived the mental and physical torture on Oct, 7, but watched as Miran was taken away to Gaza.</p><h2>Matan Angrest, 22</h2><p>Matan Angrest, an Israeli soldier, was taken from his military tank in southern Israel. He is the oldest of four children from Kiryat Bialik, outside of Haifa. His family has been among the most vocal protesters and very critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Last Tuesday, which marked two years since the Oct. 7 attack, his mother, Anat Angrest, addressed her son at a rally. "I know you're in pain, and I can't hug you. I hear you whisper, 'Come for me, Mom,' and I can't protect you," she said.</p><h2>Eitan Mor, 25</h2><p>Eitan Mor was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival, where he helped evacuate people injured in the attack. Mor's parents helped found the Tikva Forum, a loosely organized group of hostage families. They advocated for military pressure, not an immediate ceasefire or hostage release deal, as the best chance for bringing the hostages home. That stance has put Mor's father at odds with many of the other families of hostages. The Israeli military <span class="link">released a photo</span> on Monday showing Eitan Mor beaming in an embrace with his parents.</p><h2>Alon Ohel, 24</h2><p>Alon Ohel, who also has German and Serbian citizenship, was kidnapped at the Nova music festival from a mobile bomb shelter along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an American-Israeli who was killed in captivity in August 2024. A talented pianist, his family has placed pianos across Israel and several sites around the world to raise awareness of his plight. Three other hostages who had been held with Ohel for more than a year were released during the previous ceasefire, including Eli Sharabi, who said Ohel was like his adopted son. Sharabi said they were kept chained for the entire period of their captivity and subsisted on a moldy pita bread per day. Ohel has shrapnel in his eye from the attack on the bomb shelter and his family is worried he may be partially blind. Eli Sharabi, a hostage who was previously freed, <span class="link">told "CBS Sunday Morning"</span> last month that he became a father figure to Ohel in their year-plus together, and when Sharabi found out he was going to be freed, Ohel was not on the list. "You imagine this moment hundreds of times," Sharabi said. "And you believe it's going to be the happiest moment ever. And because of Alon, this moment become very complicated. He had small panic attack. He started to cry and shaking. So, we took water, washed his face, hugging him. It wasn't easy."</p><h2>Guy Gilboa-Dalal, 24</h2><p>Guy Gilboa-Dalal was among those abducted from the Nova music festival, while his brother, Gal, managed to escape. In the past year, Guy has appeared in two videos released by Hamas. In one video, he appears alongside his childhood friend, Evyatar David, with terrorists filming them in a van begging for their freedom and watching their fellow hostages being released nearby to the Red Cross. "The hardest thing for me is that I really went there to watch over him, watch over my baby brother, and I returned without him," <span class="link">Gal Dalal told CBS News</span> in May.</p><h2>Elkana Bohbot, 36</h2><p>Elkana Bohbot was kidnapped from the Nova music festival. In the past year, Hamas has published multiple videos of Bohbot, filmed under duress, including one where he has a fake telephone conversation with his wife, Rivka; their son, Reem; his mother and his brother — pleading with them to help him get out of Gaza. His son made binoculars in kindergarten which he often used to go out and "look for his father," according to Bohbot's mother, Ruhama.</p>
<h2>Rom Braslavski, 21</h2><p>Rom Braslavski was working as a security guard at the Nova festival. He attempted to help festivalgoers evacuate and was wounded in both hands before being kidnapped, witnesses said. In August, the Islamic Jihad militant group released a video of a skeletal Braslavski sobbing and pleading for his life, adding that injuries to his foot prevent him from standing. Later videos of Braslavski and fellow hostage Evyatar David digging their own graves horrified Israelis, sparking some of the largest attendance in months at weekly protests. His father, Ofir, said Rom is usually a strong, happy-go-lucky kid, and that video is the first time he's seen his son cry.</p><h2>Nimrod Cohen, 21</h2><p>Nimrod Cohen was taken from a tank where he was stationed as a soldier in southern Israel. Cohen is obsessed with Rubik's cubes, his family said, and a burned Rubik's cube was found in the tank he was abducted from. This year, his mother, Viki Cohen, illustrated a Passover haggadah, the text laying out the rituals and story recited during the Passover holiday, in honor of hostages, partly because her family stopped celebrating holidays after the attack. "We don't gather as a family, because it reminds us how much he is missing," Cohen said. The only time the extended family would gather is at protests, she said. "The best thing about my son is that he's my son," his father, Yehuda Cohen, <span class="link">told CBS News</span> last week. "He's a normal boy like every other boy. For me, he's special like his brother, sister. We are a normal family. We are a warm, normal family, and we want to get back to being a warm, normal family."</p><h2>Ariel Cunio, 28</h2><p>The youngest of four Cunio brothers, Ariel was kidnapped from the Nir Oz kibbutz about a mile from Gaza with his girlfriend, Arbel Yehoud, and her brother, Dolev, a married father of four who was later killed in captivity. According to news reports, Cunio and Yehoud had returned from an extended trip to South America weeks before the attack and had just adopted a puppy. Yehoud was released during the ceasefire in January.</p><h2>David Cunio, 35</h2><p>David Cunio, brother of Ariel Cunio, was kidnapped with his wife, Sharon, and their 3-year-old twins from the Nir Oz kibbutz. Sharon's sister Danielle and her 5-year-old daughter, who were visiting, also were kidnapped. All were released in November, except for David Cunio. In July, Sharon shared a photo of the twins marking their fifth birthday, their second without their father, writing on Facebook that the girls have changed so much while he's been in captivity that "they're not the same little girls he knew."</p><h2>Evyatar David, 24</h2><p>Evyatar David was taken hostage at the Nova music festival along with his childhood friend, Guy Gilboa-Dalal. In August, Hamas released a video of David, gaunt and pale, who said he was digging his own grave. The condition of the hostages in the videos horrified Israelis and led tens of thousands of protesters to take to the streets and demand a ceasefire deal, in one of the largest turnouts for the weekly hostage protests in months.</p><h2>Maksym Harkin, 37</h2><p>Maksym Harkin was abducted from Nova, which was the first festival he had ever attended, according to his family. Harkin was born in Ukraine and moved to Israel with his family, where he lived in the city of Tirat HaCarmel in the north. He has a 3-year-old daughter and was the primary provider for his mother and 11-year-old brother. Just before he was taken, his mother said he sent a final text message that said, "I love you." In July, Hamas released a video of him filmed under duress several months prior.</p><h2>Eitan Horn, 38</h2><p><span class="link">Eitan Horn</span>, originally from the city of Kfar Saba, was visiting his brother Iair at the Nir Oz kibbutz on Oct. 7. Both were kidnapped. For most of the war, the two were held with three other hostages in a filthy cell underground. In early February, terrorists filmed the emotional interaction between the brothers as they were told that Iair would be released and Eitan would stay in Gaza. Since his release, Iair Horn has campaigned for his brother and the other hostages, flying frequently to the United States and meeting with politicians.</p>
<h2>Segev Kalfon, 27</h2><p>Segev Kalfon was kidnapped from the Nova music festival, where he was last seen attempting to flee terrorists along the highway. Before the attack, he worked at his family's bakery in Dimona, in southern Israel. The middle child of three, Kalfon had recently been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, a condition his family has highlighted in urging his release. Kalfon's family received a sign of life from him after the last ceasefire, when some of the hostages said they were held with him for months. Kalfon's family has focused on religious rituals in their fight for his release, including traveling to the grave of prominent rabbis and dedicating a Torah scroll in his honor.</p><h2>Bar Kupershtein, 23</h2><p>Bar Kupershtein was working at the Nova festival as a security guard when he was abducted. Witnesses said Kupershtein stayed at the festival to try to provide first aid to people who had been shot and injured. Kupershtein was the main financial support for his family after his father was severely injured in an accident several years ago, his aunt, Ora Rubinstein, told reporters. She said that his father worked with a physical therapist to regain the ability to speak, so he could meet with politicians to advocate for his son's release. He has told the family that he would walk again when his son came home, she said.</p><h2>Yosef-Chaim Ohana, 25</h2><p>Yosef-Chaim Ohana was kidnapped from the Nova music festival, where he was working as a bartender. Witnesses saw him attempting to help others escape before he was kidnapped. He is the oldest of three brothers, one of whom died from an illness about 15 years ago.</p><h2>Avinatan Or, 32</h2><p>Avinatan Or was kidnapped from the Nova music festival along with his girlfriend, N<span class="link">oa Argamani,</span> who was rescued by Israeli forces in June 2024. On Oct. 7, Hamas released a video of the pair that has become one of the most well-known videos from that day. It showed Argamani on an all-terrain vehicle crying, "Don't kill me!" and reaching out her arms to Or, who is being marched away from her by terrorists. Or worked in tech in Tel Aviv before his abduction.</p><h2>Matan Zangauker, 25</h2><p>Matan Zangauker was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz along with his girlfriend, Ilana Gritzewsky. The two met while working on a medical cannabis farm there. Gritzewsky was released after 55 days and has since advocated tirelessly for his release, wearing a hat of Zangauker's she rescued from their burned home. His mother, Einav, has been a constant presence at protests, giving impassioned speeches and even being hoisted in a cage above the crowd to draw attention to the hostages' plight. Zangauker, who said she was previously a Netanyahu supporter, has emerged as one of his harshest critics.</p><h2>Two hostages determined to be dead on Monday</h2><h2>Bipin Joshi, 24</h2><p>Bipin Joshi arrived in Israel from his native Nepal a month before the attack. He was the only non-Israeli hostage believed to be alive in Gaza. He came to Israel on a student exchange to work and study agriculture at kibbutz Alumim on the Gaza border. Ten of the 17 Nepali students in the program were killed during the attack. Joshi, who was able to throw a number of live grenades out of the bomb shelter where they were hiding, was injured and kidnapped. Joshi's sister, 17-year-old Pushpa Joshi, regularly travels eight hours one way on buses to Kathmandu from her home in western Nepal to lobby to secure her brother's release. In August, his family traveled to Israel to meet with President Isaac Herzog and join families demonstrating in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square. Last week, Joshi's family released footage of him in captivity filmed under duress from around November 2023.</p><h2>Tamir Nimrodi, 20</h2><p>Tamir Nimrodi was taken from Erez, a crossing on the northern border of Gaza that had been the main route for people entering and leaving the territory. He had been serving with the Israeli defense body overseeing humanitarian aid in Gaza. Nimrodi was taken with two other soldiers by terrorists who walked them to the Gaza gate and forced them to cross. Israel confirmed the deaths of the two soldiers who were taken with Nimrodi. There had been no sign of life from Nimrodi in the two years since he was seen in footage walking into Gaza in shorts and a T-shirt without his glasses. Herut Nimrodi, his mother, said she didn't know what was worse: to think he had been killed in captivity, or that he was alive but being held in terrible conditions. "I'm scared to even imagine," she said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump hails "historic dawn of a new Middle East" in speech to Knesset</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump hailed " the historic dawn of a new Middle East" in <span class="link">remarks</span> to Israeli lawmakers at the Knesset on Monday, after all living <span class="link">hostages were reunited</span> with their families. </p><p>The president received repeated standing ovations from the Israeli parliament during his more than hour-long speech Monday, as he declared the start of a new era in the Middle East and peace for Israel. The hostages were released to the Red Cross in Gaza early Monday, before being taken to be reunited with their families in Israel, more than two years after Hamas launched its deadly assault on Oct. 7, 2023. </p><p>"After two harrowing years in darkness and captivity, 20 courageous hostages are returning to the glorious embrace of their families, and it is glorious," Mr. Trump said. "Twenty-eight more precious loved ones are coming home at last to rest in this sacred soil for all of time. And after so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today, the skies are calm, the guns are silent, the sirens are still, and the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace, a land and a region that will live, God willing, in peace for all eternity."</p><p>He called it "a brilliant point in time" and told the Knesset, "Generations from now, this will be remembered as the moment that everything began to change, and change very much for the better, like the USA right now, it will be the golden age of Israel, and the golden age of the Middle East."</p><p>Mr. Trump singled out for praise special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who was at the forefront of negotiations and critical in reaching a deal all parties could sign. Mr. Trump lauded Witkoff, who was a real estate developer before he joined the Trump administration, for his negotiating skills but said he thinks his likeability is what makes him so successful. The Knesset chamber erupted in applause for Witkoff.</p>
<p>"Steve started this all by himself," Mr. Trump said of the peace deal. "I call him Henry Kissinger who doesn't leak, okay? Henry was a big leaker. He leaked. Steve doesn't leak. Steve just wants to get the job done, he wants to do what's right." </p><p>Two Israeli lawmakers who held up signs saying "Recognize Palestine" and interrupted Mr. Trump's remarks at the Knesset were ejected from the parliament.</p><p>The president also made light of the critics he said had predicted that he'd "drag" the U.S. into more wars. </p><p>"But when you settle eight wars in eight months, that means you don't like war," he said.</p>
<p>"Everyone thought I was going to be brutal. In fact, l remember Hillary Clinton during a debate, she said, 'Look at him, look at him, he's going to go to war with everybody.' And actually, she said, 'He's got a personality that's all about war.' No, my personality actually is all about stopping wars, and it seems to work. Seems to work."</p><p>But on Friday, Clinton, who was secretary of state during the Obama administration and lost the 2016 presidential election to Mr. Trump and has long had an acrimonious relationship with him, had words of praise for Mr. Trump and the Israel-Hamas deal he brokered. In an <span class="link">interview</span> with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, Clinton called it "a significant step" and added, "I really commend President Trump and his administration" and Arab leaders in the region for committing to the 20-point peace plan. </p><p>In one of the more awkward moments of the president's lengthy remarks, he called for Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, apparently in reference to <span class="link">corruption charges</span> Netanyahu has been fighting for years. </p><p>"I have an idea. Mr President, why don't you give him a pardon? Give him a pardon," Mr. Trump said, turning to Herzog. </p><p>"By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know! But I happen to like this gentleman right  over here, and it just seems to make so much sense."</p><p>The president also told Netanyahu the timing of the agreement to end the war is "brilliant," and he suggested continuing the war could have been politically perilous for the prime minister. Netanyahu's offensive in Gaza was <span class="link">condemned</span> by a number of countries over severe restrictions on the distribution of food to Palestinians and the killing of civilians. He has also been harshly criticized by his own people and was booed in Hostage Square Saturday night when Witkoff mentioned his name. </p><p>"The world wanted peace and Israel wanted peace, everybody did," Mr. Trump said. "What a victory it's been. If you'd kept going on for three, four years fighting, fighting, fighting, it was getting bad, it was getting heated. The timing of this is brilliant and I said, 'Bibi you're going to be remembered for this for far more than if you kept this going, going, going, kill, kill, kill.' It would not be the same. And I just want to congratulate you for having the courage — that's it."</p>
<p>He urged Israelis to focus now on peace and reconstruction: "We've won, and now let's rebuild our lives and make it stronger and bigger and better than ever before."</p><p>The president met with some of the Israeli hostages' families at the Knesset before delivering his remarks, according to the Hostage and Missing Families Forum. Afterward, the president traveled to Egypt for a peace signing ceremony. </p>

<div class="article-title">Possible Nobel leak was likely espionage, committee secretary says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A potential leak that preceded the announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader <span class="link">Maria Corina Machado</span> was "highly likely" the result of espionage, the Nobel Institute told Norwegian media on Saturday.</p><p>The odds of Machado winning the prize jumped from 3.75% to nearly 73% overnight, Thursday to Friday on the predictive betting platform Polymarket.</p><p>However, no expert or media outlet had mentioned her as being among the favorites for the prize, which was announced just a few hours later in Oslo.</p><p>"Highly likely it's espionage," the director of the Nobel Institute and secretary of the Nobel committee, Kristian Berg Harpviken, told Norway's TV2 television.</p><p>On Friday, the head of the Nobel committee said he didn't believe Machado's name had been leaked.</p>
<p>"I don't think there have ever been any leaks in the entire history of the prize. I can't imagine that's the case," committee chairman Jorgen Watne Frydnes told the NTB news agency.</p><p>Harpviken said the institute would nevertheless investigate and "where necessary, we will further tighten security".</p><p>Espionage "could make it appear as if someone on the inside deliberately leaked information. That is not likely," he said.</p><p>"It's too certain to say for sure, but it's no secret that the Nobel Institute is subject to espionage," he added.</p>
<p>"It is obvious that the institution is of interest to actors who want to acquire information, both states and other organizations," he said, adding: "The motives can be both political and economic."</p><p>"This has been going on for many decades."</p><p>Harpviken did not respond to AFP's requests for comment.</p><p>An extremely limited number of people know in advance the name of the laureate chosen by the five members of the Nobel Committee.</p><p>In the past, unexpected names of Nobel nominees have emerged in the Norwegian media, fuelling speculation about possible leaks. But this has not been the case in recent years.</p><p>Machado, an opposition leader barred from running in Venezuela's 2024 presidential election, was awarded "for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy", the committee said.</p><p>A video shared on social media showed Harpviken calling Machado on Friday morning to inform her that she had been chosen for the coveted prize. He is visibly emotional while sharing the news during a phone call with Machado before it was announced to the world.</p>
<p>"Oh my God. I have no words. Thank you so much," Machado can be heard saying during the call. "I hope you understand this is a movement, this is an achievement for a whole society. I am just one person; I certainly do not deserve this. Oh my God."</p>

<div class="article-title">Alaska hit by severe flooding that carries away homes</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The remnants of Typhoon Halong brought hurricane-force winds and catastrophic flooding to coastal communities in western Alaska on Sunday, pushing entire houses off their foundations.  </p><p>Rescue aircraft were dispatched to the tiny Alaskan villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, where there were reports of up to 20 people possibly unaccounted for, said Jeremy Zidek, spokesperson for the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.</p><p>"We have received reports that people's homes have floated away and that people were potentially in those homes," Zidek told The Associated Press.</p><p>Alaska State Troopers said both Kipnuk and Kwigillingok were hit by "strong winds and heavy flooding, which caused significant damage, including at least eight homes being pushed from their foundations."</p><p>In Kwigillingok, at least 18 people were rescued, while at least 16 people were rescued in Kipnuk, Alaska State Troopers said Sunday evening local time. Three people were still unaccounted for in Kwigillingok as of 6:50 p.m. local time. Troopers had also received reports of people still unaccounted for in Kipnuk but couldn't confirm the exact number.</p>
<p>"Search efforts will be continuing overnight as conditions allow," the troopers said in a statement Sunday evening. ... "This is an active and ongoing search and rescue effort."</p><p>That effort was being coordinated by the Alaska State Troopers, with assistance from the Alaska Air National Guard, Alaska Army National Guard and U.S. Coast Guard, the troopers pointed out.    </p><p>More than a dozen agencies are involved in the disaster response, CBS Fairbanks affiliate KXDF-TV reported, including the Alaska National Guard. </p><p>"The Alaska Organized Militia, which includes the Alaska National Guard, Alaska State Defense Force, and Alaska Naval Militia, has been requested to activate up to 60 members to assist with storm response operations across affected western Alaska communities," the National Guard wrote Saturday.</p>
<h2>Alaska governor: "Help is on the way"</h2><p>According to the nonprofit Coastal Villages Region Fund, nearly 600 people in Kipnuk were taking shelter at a local school while around 300 were sheltering in a school in Kwigillingok.</p><p>Roads and boardwalks were inundated and power lines were damaged in Bethel, Napaskiak, Napakiak, and other Yukon-Kuskokwim communities. Crews worked to clear the airport runway in Bethel, which was littered with debris from high winds. The area is among the most isolated in the U.S., and some communities have few roads and residents use boardwalks, boats and snowmobiles to get around, Zidek said.</p><p>"Every effort will be made to help those hit by this storm. Help is on the way," Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a statement.</p><p>Dunleavy also said he has expanded the state's disaster declaration to include areas impacted by the storm.

<div class="article-title">Data centers are booming. But there are big energy and environmental risks</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Google recently courted the township of Franklin, Ind., so that it could construct a giant campus to house the computer hardware that powers its internet business. But the company needed to rezone more than 450 acres in the Indianapolis suburb, and residents weren't having it.</p> <p>Many were concerned the facility would consume huge amounts of water and electricity while delivering few local benefits. When a lawyer representing Google confirmed at a September public meeting that the company was pulling its data center proposal, cheers erupted from sign-waving residents.</p> <p>Similar fights are happening around the United States. On one side are companies pouring billions of dollars into data centers, which increasingly are being built to support artificial intelligence models that promise to transform how people live and work. On the other side are residents who worry the construction spree will have dire consequences for the environment, power prices and surrounding communities.</p>
<p>How tech companies and government officials handle those concerns will shape the industry's future in the U.S. and the country's competitiveness, according to analysts and academics who track the AI industry.</p> <p>Local opposition "slowing down the development of the industry or distributing it in sort of weird regional patterns is probably the most overlooked potential outcome in this conversation," says Joseph Majkut, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p> <p>Here's what you need to know about the data center and AI boom — and what's at stake.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">What are data centers?</h3> <p>They're big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information. They essentially function as the backbone of the internet. Some of the largest cover more than a million square feet — the size of more than 17 football fields.</p> <p>When you read this story, or send an email or transfer money from your bank account online, you're relying on data centers scattered around the world.</p> <p>And that computing power has a big environmental footprint. A typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, and the largest under development will consume 20 times more, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). They also suck up billions of gallons of water for systems to keep all that computer hardware cool.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Why am I hearing so much about data centers right now?</h3> <p>Data centers have been around for decades. But there's an investment frenzy around AI right now that's fueling a construction boom.</p> <p>That growth is being driven by AI investors seeking enormous profits, thanks to the rising interest in AI from individual consumers and businesses. Within two years of ChatGPT's launch in 2022, for example, around 40% of households in the U.S. and United Kingdom reported using AI chatbots, according to the IEA. Roughly the same share of large companies were using AI last year, up from around 15% in 2020, the agency said.</p> <p>Tech companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and AI computer chips. They're betting that more people and businesses will use the technology in the future. By 2027, AI is expected to account for 28% of the global data center market, according to Goldman Sachs, more than double its current share.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Where are data centers being built?</h3> <p>With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA. But the agency said there are also signs that development is spreading into other markets, like Las Vegas, that offer affordable land, cheap electricity from renewable power plants and industry tax incentives.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said this month that "a potential data center boom is just getting started" in its district, which covers Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Michigan and Wisconsin.</p> <p>"It definitely feels like we are starting to see the rollout of what these massive investments in data centers are potentially going to start to look like on the ground," says Melissa Scanlan, director of the Center for Water Policy at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">What are the benefits of AI?</h3> <p>Artificial intelligence generally refers to computer systems that learn to carry out tasks that traditionally required human intelligence, like reasoning and decision making, according to NASA.</p> <p>Some AI is being used to make images and videos online. The IEA says it's also being deployed in the medical field, to rapidly map protein structures for drug development; in the energy industry to quickly detect pipeline leaks and manage electricity networks; and in weather forecasting, to produce more accurate outlooks.</p> <p>To remain competitive, the U.S. needs to be able to respond to what the market demands, whether it's "more AI in the form of robotics, or we want much more in the form of digital services to make professionals more productive," says Majkut of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Then there's a variety of applications in the national security, cybersecurity realm where the U.S. having a strong lead in the best [AI] models, the best chips, I think, is also something we want to pursue."</p> <p>Does it matter if the data centers that train and run those AI models are located in the U.S.? There are certainly potential economic benefits, like construction jobs and local tax revenue. But some localities are giving up a portion of those payments by offering tax breaks to lure project developers.</p> <p>"Because much of the upfront investment is about physical infrastructure, having that investment here is hugely beneficial to the American economy," says Andrew Chien, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. The challenge for communities is figuring out how to turn those initial investments into long-term benefits, Chien adds, like high-paying jobs.</p> <p>Since it doesn't take many people to operate a data center, once they're built, the facilities don't usually support many permanent jobs.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">What's driving the local pushback against data centers?</h3> <p>Some people don't want huge industrial facilities — and all the noise and light that comes with them — changing the character of their community.</p>
<p>But people are also concerned about data centers depleting local water supplies for their cooling systems, driving up electricity bills and worsening climate change if the facilities rely on fossil fuel power plants for the electricity they need. The IEA says climate pollution from the power plants that run data centers could more than double by 2035.</p> <p>Consider what's happening around the Great Lakes, where Scanlan of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says there's a flurry of data center activity. The Great Lakes can be thought of as "a giant pitcher of water with straws going into it" from water utilities, business and power plants in eight states and two Canadian provinces, Scanlan says. The question is, how much more water can the lakes provide for data centers and the power plants needed to run them in the coming years?</p> <p>In Georgia, some residents reported problems getting drinking water from their wells after a data center was built nearby. And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.</p> <p>Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, says companies have been working to reduce how much water their facilities consume. While some data centers use evaporative cooling systems in which water is lost as steam, others rely on closed-loop systems that use less water. A Google data center in Georgia uses treated wastewater for cooling and then returns it to the Chattahoochee River, Diorio said. And there's a push for waterless cooling systems.</p> <p>"It's a balance between water and electricity," Diorio says. "If you use more electricity to cool, you're going to use less water. If you use more water, you'll use less electricity."</p> <p>Rising electricity bills are also a major concern as data centers spike power demand in certain areas. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists recently found that in 2024, homes and businesses in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia faced $4.3 billion in additional costs from transmission projects that were needed to deliver power to data centers.</p>
<p>Diorio says the data center industry "is fully committed to paying its full cost of service for electricity."</p> <p>Data centers aren't the only source of new power demand. The construction of factories and increased sales of electric vehicles and home appliances like electric stoves are also increasing the country's electricity needs.</p> <p>Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations. Without more transparency around water and energy consumption, Scanlan says the public doesn't have the information it needs to make informed decisions about data center development.</p> <p>Diorio says data center companies are trying to be "responsible partners" in the communities where they operate. But they sometimes worry that sharing information about their water and energy use could give rivals a competitive edge.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Are there other challenges to data center development?</h3> <p>The big one is having enough electricity to meet rising demand.</p> <p>The Trump administration has been taking steps to limit development of renewable energy projects. Industry executives and analysts say renewables are crucial to boost power supplies because the projects can be built quickly, and they generate electricity that is relatively cheap.</p> <p>Pavan Venkatakrishnan, an infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress, says there's a "clear conflict" between the administration's position on renewables and its desire to accelerate data center construction.</p> <p>A White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, said in a statement that AI "cannot be beholden to unreliable sources of energy that must be heavily subsidized to be economical. The Trump administration is focused on unleashing the forms of energy — from natural gas to nuclear — that do work and that do not need consistent government subsidies to power the next Golden Age for America."</p> <p>Solar and wind power coupled with large batteries to store electricity are reliable power sources. There's also widespread agreement among energy analysts and executives that natural gas and nuclear will play an important role in meeting new electricity demand. But they say those technologies can't be deployed quickly enough at scale right now to meet the country's immediate needs.</p>

<div class="article-title">Opinion: Why I'm handing in my Pentagon press pass</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Today, NPR will lose access to the Pentagon because we will not sign an unprecedented Defense Department document, which warns that journalists may lose their press credentials for "soliciting" even unclassified information from federal employees that has not been officially approved for release. That policy prevents us from doing our job. Signing that document would make us stenographers parroting press releases, not watchdogs holding government officials accountable.<br/> <br/>No reputable news organization signed the new rule — not mainstream outlets like NPR, the Washington Post, CNN, and the New York Times, nor the conservative Washington Times or the right-wing Newsmax, run by a noted ally of President Trump. Some 100 resident Pentagon press will be barred from the building if they don't sign by the end of business on Tuesday. <br/> <br/>I've held my Pentagon press pass for 28 years. For most of that time, when I wasn't overseas in combat zones embedding with troops, I walked the halls, talking to and getting to know officers from all over the globe, at times visiting them in their offices.</p>
<p>Did I as a reporter solicit information? Of course. It's called journalism: finding out what's really going on behind the scenes and not accepting wholesale what any government or administration says.</p> <p>I remember how then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was ecstatic after the fall of Baghdad in 2003, insisting that it showed the success of the U.S. invasion. Not long after, I ran into an officer at the Pentagon who told me, "No, Tom. It's <em>not</em> a success. Saddam Hussein's supporters are attacking our supply lines. Now, we have to send <em>more</em> troops back to guard them." That was because the United States, at Rumsfeld's insistence, never sent an adequate number of forces to Iraq to begin with — a fact another Army general warned me about, unsolicited — and I reported on, before the war even began.  <br/> <br/>Instead of toeing the official line, that reporting helped people understand what U.S. troops were really facing. Far from being a success, the fall of Baghdad marked the beginning of an insurgency that stretched on for years.</p>
<p>(Defense Department officials, by the way, have already restricted reporter movements in the Pentagon. They closed that particular hallway to reporters several months ago.) <br/> <br/>In 2009, when the Obama administration announced a  "surge" of State Department employees to Afghanistan to help the military keep the peace in restive, far-flung provinces, one Marine officer told me months later: "If there was a surge, we never saw it." And when the administration touted an Afghan "government in a box," to bring experienced Afghans to the provinces, it proved to be a failure. One general told me: "Next time they tell you there's a government in a box, check the box."<br/> <br/>Again, I reported both stories. That's my job. <br/> <br/>Over the years, to be able to inform the public and hold the government to account for the wars being waged in Iraq and Afghanistan and the fight against the Islamic State in Syria, NPR reporters, producers, photographers and I have spent a lot of time in combat zones.</p>
<p>We got to know soldiers and Marines over the years while embedding with them, talking with them and getting their perspective, which was often far different from what we were told officially at the Pentagon. Sometimes officials at the Pentagon would declare progress or success. Out in dusty combat outposts or on patrols, we would learn the truth was far more complicated. I'm still in touch with many of those soldiers and Marines we met long ago. I'm having a beer with one of them the end of this week. They want the truth to get out, too. <br/> <br/>In June 2016, U.S. officials were insisting that Afghan troops were making progress against the Taliban. I was part of a team of NPR reporters that embedded with Afghan forces to find out if that official line was indeed true, trying to get the ground truth about what had become America's longest war. We were travelling in an Afghan convoy in western Afghanistan when we were ambushed. I lost two friends and NPR lost two brave colleagues, photographer David Gilkey and translator Zabihullah Tammana, that day. Producer and colleague Monika Evstatieva and I were in that convoy, took small arms fire, but were unharmed. <br/> <br/>When we flew by helicopter to bring David and Zabi's bodies to a nearby American base, the U.S. general there ordered an honor cordon, a tribute that is usually reserved for fallen troops, not civilians from the United States and Afghanistan. Out of respect for two people who'd lost their lives in their line of duty, doing their jobs documenting the truth as journalists, U.S. soldiers lined up in the darkness on either side as David and Zabi were carried off the helicopter.  I fought hard not to weep at one of the most decent, humane, and heartfelt gestures I've ever seen.</p>
<p>In NPR's lobby, there's a memorial to David and Zabi, including one of the cameras David was carrying that day, scorched and damaged. <br/> <br/>So yes, we've received solicited and unsolicited information on everything from failed policies and botched military operations that led to unnecessary military and civilian deaths, to wasteful government projects that both Democratic and Republicans administrations would rather stay in the shadows.  <br/> <br/>That's our job. <br/> <br/>Now, we're barely getting any information at all from the Pentagon. In the 10 months that the Trump administration has been in office, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given just two briefings.</p>
<p>And there have been virtually no background briefings, which were common in the past whenever there has been military action anywhere in the world, as there has been with the recent bombings of Iran's nuclear facilities and of boats off the coast of Venezuela alleged to be carrying illicit drugs. In previous administrations, Defense Department officials — including the acerbic Rumsfeld — would hold regular press briefings, often twice a week. They knew the American people deserved to know what was going on.</p>
<p> <br/>Thomas Jefferson, no fan of the press himself, once wrote that our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, "and that cannot be limited without being lost." He knew a free and fair press is an essential safeguard to a functioning democracy. <br/> <br/>So now, how will the American people find out what is being done at the Pentagon in their name, with their hard-earned tax dollars, and more importantly, the decisions that may put their sons and daughters in harm's way? With no reporters able to ask questions, it seems the Pentagon leadership will continue to rely on slick social media posts, carefully orchestrated short videos and interviews with partisan commentators and podcasters. <br/> <br/>No one should think that's good enough.  <br/> </p>

<div class="article-title">In reading, the nation's students are still stuck in a pandemic slump</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>When it comes to reading, the nation's third- through eighth-graders are still mired in a pandemic-era slump, according to new testing data. In math, the news is only a little more heartening: Student achievement in those grades either held steady or improved slightly, though all grades remain behind performance levels of same-grade students in 2019.</p> <p>The data comes from NWEA, a K-12 testing and research organization, and its Spring 2025 MAP Growth assessment, a suite of tests taken by millions of students in thousands of U.S. schools.</p>
<p>"Math is crawling back, however modestly, but reading isn't budging," says Karyn Lewis, vice president of research at NWEA. "I know people want this chapter to be over, but these data remind us it isn't. Looking away won't make the problem disappear; it means accepting these outcomes are permanent. That is not an option."</p> <p>NWEA is also unveiling a new tool that will be publicly available: A performance dashboard meant to help school leaders and policymakers understand how their students are faring compared to a broad, representative sample of the country.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Reading scores remain stuck</h3> <p>There's little good news in the spring 2025 reading scores. They show slight gains made across grade levels in 2022 have been erased, with students across grade levels mostly performing at or even below pandemic-era achievement lows.</p> <p>In short, students from third- through eighth grade are still performing worse than students in the same grades in 2019. This "stagnation is consistent regardless of race/ethnicity or school poverty level," NWEA said in a press release.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Math scores rebound slightly</h3> <p>There's a little more room for optimism in the spring 2025 math achievement data.</p> <p>Students in several grades made slight gains compared to the same age groups in 2024. Most grades have also shown slow but steady improvement since 2021.</p>
<p>One more positive: This improvement in math achievement has come across student groups, regardless of race/ethnicity or socio-economic status.</p> <p>Unfortunately, in spring 2025, no grades were performing in math at the levels seen in 2019, before the pandemic.</p>
<p>NWEA's takeaways mirror similarly worrying patterns highlighted by federal data released earlier this year as part of what's known as the Nation's Report Card.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A new performance dashboard</h3><h3 class="edTag"></h3> <p>NWEA has also released a new public-facing dashboard for schools and politicians to gauge where their local students are performing relative to the rest of the country.</p> <p>The dashboard will be updated with new data three times a year – far more often than comparable data from the Nation's Report Card, which only comes out every two years.</p> <p>Tom Kane, of Harvard University's Center for Education Policy Research, likens these rounds of student achievement data to helpful health checks to see how students are doing.</p> <p>"Two years is too long for American students to go between doctor visits, especially when recovering from a major injury, such as occurred during the pandemic," Kane says, calling the data available through this new dashboard "an essential complement to [the Nation's Report Card] for tracking students' recovery."</p> <p>Megan Kuhfeld, director of growth modeling and data analytics at NWEA, says, "Given the unevenness of recovery, even within schools and classrooms, national trends like these are an important first step to understanding where to dig deeper at the local level and ask critical questions about the necessary support and resources."</p>
<p>The move to give districts and states more data to help inform their decision-making – including on whether and how to spend scarce school dollars on academic interventions – comes as the Trump administration has gutted the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), the division within the U.S. Department of Education that collects, analyzes and publishes federal student achievement data.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>POZA RICA, Mexico — Fifteen minutes before water from a flooded stream swept into her home, Lilia Ramírez took off running with what little she could carry. When she returned she found not only damage from the water that had flooded her first floor to the ceiling, but the oil it had carried now streaking her walls.</p>
<p>Poza Rica is an oil town, and among the challenges confronting some residents who fled flooding that has killed 64 people across five states and left 65 missing, is residue from the oil that built this city not far from the Gulf of Mexico. Authorities say some 100,000 homes across the region have been damaged by the torrential rains and flooding.</p> <p>"Never before has it been tarred before like that," Ramírez said Monday standing in her devastated ground floor, where walls that had once been pink were now vertically striped with black.</p>
<p>Mexico has deployed some 10,000 troops in addition to civilian rescue teams. Helicopters have ferried food and water to the 200 some communities that remained cut off by ground and carried out the sick and injured.</p> <p>"There are sufficient resources, this won't be skimped on ... because we're still in the emergency period," President Claudia Sheinbaum said during her daily press briefing Monday.</p> <p>But on some streets in Poza Rica, 170 miles (275 kilometers) northeast of Mexico City, the cleanup of mud and debris was complicated by thick oil deposits on trees, roofs and vehicles tossed by the current that swept through Friday.</p>
<p>Parts of Veracruz state received some 24.7 inches (62.7 centimeters) of rain from Oct. 6 to 9.</p> <p>Ramírez said that at other times of heavy rains, the state oil company Pemex had drained nearby areas with oil to avoid it spreading.</p> <p>Roberto Olvera, one of her neighbors, said that a siren from a nearby Pemex facility alerted them to danger. "It was a really anguishing moment because a lot of people from the neighborhood stayed behind and some perished," he said.</p> <p>Pemex said in a brief statement to the AP that so far it did not have reports of an oil spill in the area.</p>
<p>Sheinbaum acknowledged it could still be days before access is established to some places. "A lot of flights are required to take sufficient food and water" to those places, she said.</p> <p>The president denied that government systems had failed to provide sufficient warning. "It would have been difficult to have had much advance knowledge of this situation, (it's) different from with hurricanes," she said.</p> <p>Mexico's Civil Protection agency said the heavy rains had killed 29 people in Veracruz state on the Gulf Coast as of Monday morning, and 21 people in Hidalgo state, north of Mexico City. At least 13 were killed in Puebla, east of Mexico City. Earlier, in the central state of Querétaro, a child died in a landslide.</p> <p>Authorities have attributed the deadly downpours to two tropical systems that formed off the western coast of Mexico and have since dissipated, Hurricane Pricilla and Tropical Storm Raymond.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>SpaceX launched another of its mammoth Starship rockets on a test flight Monday, successfully making it halfway around the world while releasing mock satellites like last time.</p> <p>Starship — the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built — thundered into the evening sky from the southern tip of Texas. The booster peeled away and made a controlled entry into the Gulf of Mexico as planned, with the spacecraft skimming space before descending into the Indian Ocean. Nothing was recovered.</p> <p>"Hey, welcome back to Earth, Starship," SpaceX's Dan Huot announced as employees cheered. "What a day."</p> <p>It was the 11th test flight for a full-scale Starship, which SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk intends to use to send people to Mars. NASA's need is more immediate. The space agency cannot land astronauts on the moon by decade's end without the 403-foot (123-meter) Starship, the reusable vehicle meant to get them from lunar orbit down to the surface and back up.</p>
<p>Instead of remaining inside Launch Control as usual, Musk said that for the first time he was going outside to watch — "much more visceral."</p> <p>The previous test flight in August — a success after a string of explosive failures — followed a similar path with similar goals. More maneuvering was built in this time, especially for the spacecraft. SpaceX conducted a series of tests during the spacecraft's entry over the Indian Ocean as practice for future landings back at the launch site.</p> <p>Like before, Starship carried up eight mock satellites mimicking SpaceX's Starlinks. The entire flight lasted just over an hour, originating from Starbase near the Mexican border.</p> <p>NASA's acting administrator Sean Duffy praised Starship's progress. "Another major step toward landing Americans on the moon's south pole," he said via X.</p> <p>SpaceX is modifying its Cape Canaveral launch sites to accommodate Starships, in addition to the much smaller Falcon rockets used to transport astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station for NASA.</p>

<div class="article-title">Madagascar's president flees country in fear for his life after military rebellion</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar — Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina said he has fled the country in fear for his life following a military rebellion but did not announce his resignation in a speech broadcast on social media late Monday from an undisclosed location.</p> <p>Rajoelina has faced weeks of Gen Z-led anti-government protests, which reached a pivotal point on Saturday when an elite military unit joined the protests and called for the president and other government ministers to step down. That prompted Rajoelina to say that an illegal attempt to seize power was underway in the Indian Ocean island and leave the country.</p>
<p>"I was forced to find a safe place to protect my life," Rajoelina said in his late-night speech, which was also meant to be shown on Madagascar television but was delayed for hours after soldiers attempted to take control of the state broadcaster buildings, according to the president's office.</p> <p>The speech was ultimately broadcast on the presidency's official Facebook page but not on national TV.</p>
<p>They were Rajoelina's first public comments since the CAPSAT military unit turned against his government in an apparent coup and joined thousands of protesters rallying in a main square in the capital, Antananarivo, over the weekend.</p> <p>Rajoelina called for dialogue "to find a way out of this situation" and said the constitution should be respected. He did not say how he left Madagascar or where he was, but a report claimed he was flown out of the country on a French military plane.</p> <p>A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson declined to comment on that report.</p> <p>Madagascar is a former French colony and Rajoelina reportedly has French citizenship, which has been a source of discontent for some Madagascans for years.</p> <p>The anti-government protests began on Sept. 25 over chronic water and electricity outages but have snowballed into wider discontent with Rajoelina and his government.</p>
<p>It is the most significant unrest in the island nation of 31 million people off the east coast of Africa since Rajoelina himself first came to power as the leader of a transitional government following a 2009 military-backed coup.</p> <p>The same elite CAPSAT military unit that rebelled against Rajoelina was prominent in him first coming to power in 2009.</p> <h2 class="edTag"><strong>Elite unit claims to control the military</strong></h2>
<p>Rajoelina hasn't identified who was behind this attempted coup, but the CAPSAT unit has said it now controls all the armed forces in Madagascar and has appointed a new officer in charge of the military, which was accepted by the defense minister in Rajoelina's absence.</p> <p>CAPSAT appears to be in a position of authority and also has the backing of other military units, including the gendarmerie security forces.</p> <p>A commander of CAPSAT, Col. Michael Randrianirina, said the army had "responded to the people's calls" but denied there was a coup. Speaking at the country's military headquarters on Sunday, he told reporters that it was up to the Madagascan people to decide what happens next, and if Rajoelina leaves power and a new election is held.</p> <p>Randrianirina said his soldiers had decided to stand with protesters and had exchanged gunfire with security forces who were attempting to quell weekend protests, and one of his soldiers was killed. But there was no major fighting on the streets, and soldiers riding on armored vehicles and waving Madagascar flags were cheered by people in Antananarivo.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in Madagascar still advised American citizens to shelter in place because of a "highly volatile and unpredictable" situation. The African Union urged all parties, "both civilian and military, to exercise calm and restraint."</p> <h2 class="edTag"><strong>Weeks of protests</strong></h2> <p>Madagascar has been shaken by three weeks of deadly anti-government protests that were initially led by a group calling itself "Gen Z Madagascar."</p> <p>The United Nations says the demonstrations left at least 22 people dead and dozens injured and criticized Madagascan authorities for a "violent response" to what were largely peaceful protests in the early days of the movement. The government has disputed the number of deaths.</p>
<p>The demonstrators have brought up a range of issues, including poverty and the cost of living, access to tertiary education, and alleged corruption and embezzlement of public funds by government officials, as well as their families and associates.</p> <p>Civic groups and trade unions also joined the protests, which resulted in nighttime curfews being enforced in Antananarivo and other major cities. Curfews were still in effect in Antananarivo and the northern port city of Antsiranana.</p>
<p>The Gen Z protesters who started the uprising have mobilized over the internet and say they were inspired by the protests that toppled governments in Nepal and Sri Lanka.</p> <h2 class="edTag"><strong>History of political crises</strong></h2> <p>Madagascar has had several leaders removed in coups and has a history of political crises since it gained independence from France in 1960.</p> <p>The 51-year-old Rajoelina first came to prominence as the leader of a transitional government following the 2009 coup that forced then-President Marc Ravalomanana to flee the country and lose power. Rajoelina was elected president in 2018 and reelected in 2023 in a vote boycotted by opposition parties.</p> <p>Madagascar's former prime minister under Rajoelina and one of the president's closest advisers have also fled the country and arrived in the nearby island of Mauritius in the predawn hours Sunday, the Mauritian government said. Mauritius said it was "not satisfied" that the private plane had landed on its territory.</p>

<div class="article-title">In Marc Maron's last 'WTF' podcast episode, Obama offers advice on closing chapters</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The bi-weekly podcast by actor and comedian Marc Maron ended with presidential flair — capping a more than 15-year run that reached millions of listeners.</p> <p>Episode 1,686 of <em>WTF with Marc Maron</em> dropped on Monday featuring former President Barack Obama as the final guest.</p> <p>At the start of the episode, Maron explained that he wanted to speak with someone who can help not only reflect on the podcast's legacy, but how he and his listeners should navigate the world. He also wanted insight from the former president on the current state of politics moving forward.</p> <p>"And how do we do it with some grace and perhaps some hope and some focus," Maron said, asking how to engage in civil discourse.</p>
<p>Obama first appeared on <em>WTF</em> back in 2015, recording from inside Maron's garage. For the second conversation, Maron said it was only fair that this time he host the show from Obama's house in Washington, D.C.</p> <p>During their hour-long talk, the two spoke about President Trump's second administration, the impact of social media and the need to treat others with decency and respect.</p> <p>Maron launched <em>WTF</em> with producer Brendan McDonald in September 2009 when podcasting started to gain traction. Over the years, it became the go-to spot for in-depth conversations with actors, directors, writers and most notably, other comedians. Some entertainers who appeared on the podcast include Robin Williams, Louis C.K. and Lorne Michaels.</p> <p><em>WTF  </em>won several awards throughout the years, including Best Comedy Podcast in 2016 by the Academy of Podcasters.</p> <p>In July, Maron told <em>NPR's Fresh Air</em> that ending the podcast was a difficult decision, but that he and McDonald had reached a point where they were proud of what they created and were feeling burnt out.</p>
<p>"I just don't think there's any shame in stopping if moving forward would compromise either my or Brendan's vision of the thing or our ability to do it," he said on <em>Fresh Air</em>. "We've maintained our audience all these years, and a lot of them are very close to me. And oddly, the decision made sense to a lot of them."</p> <p>Part of Maron's charm on<em> WTF </em>was his vulnerability. He openly discussed his struggles with anxiety, loss and past addiction to drugs and alcohol.<em> </em>During the last episode of <em>WTF</em>, Maron told Obama that he was ready for the break but he also felt some nervousness about what comes next.</p>
<p>"There is sort of a fear there, of what do I do now?" he said.</p> <p>"There is a feeling of like, how am I going to feel less alone? How am I going to deal with my mental this or that? And how am I going to find, you know, a way to exist in the world that we're living in?" Maron added.</p>
<p>The former president responded by sharing how he adjusted to life after leaving the White House.</p> <p>"Don't rush into what the next thing is. Take a beat and take some satisfaction," Obama said. "Pat yourself on the back for a second."</p>

<div class="article-title">Ecuador: The Andean reinvention of cumbia</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p><em>This is part of a special series, </em><em>Cumbia Across Latin America</em><em>, a visual report across six countries developed over several years, covering the people, places and cultures that keep this music genre alive.</em></p>
<p>The first cumbia recorded in Ecuador at the end of the 1960s had only one verse. It was called "Cumbia Triste" and was written by Polibio Mayorga. This musician from Ambato, Ecuador, tropicalized the national music of the Ecuadorian highlands, which had long been stigmatized for its Indigenous roots and the sad melodies often associated with them. Mayorga combined the rhythms of the San Juanito — traditional Andean music — with rural Colombian cumbia, which arrived in Ecuador via the record industry, already processed and whitewashed. The result marked a new identity for many provincial migrants who came to populate the country's urban centers.</p>
<p>While Polibio Mayorga laid the groundwork for an Ecuadorian cumbia sound, it was musicians like Medardo Luzuriaga who transformed the genre into a national sensation. His son Manuel Luzuriaga plays for the cumbia orchestra Los Cumbancheros and when he talks about his father, his eyes shine. Medardo was Manuel's teacher and one of the most respected musicians in the history of cumbia orchestras in Ecuador. At the end of the '60s, Medardo created the orchestra Don Medardo y sus Players. Medardo recorded more than 100 albums, and his emblematic cumbias, including "Cumbia Chonera" and "La Novia," still live in the collective conscience of the entire country. Many of his children and grandchildren created multiple orchestras after his death, all still playing his golden repertoire.</p>
<p>Estafanny Guerrero has wanted to be a "Canelita" since she was 5 years old. Standing with her boots and red hair extensions on the table, she sang the songs of Tierra Canela, a female tecnocumbia group that hires young women from all over the country. Thousands participated in the latest callout to find new members. Some musicians and spectators criticize the group, saying they're just pretty faces and sexy bodies, but they spend long hours in singing and dancing classes, and can fire up any audience. Tecnocumbia, a product of mass consumption, mixes Indigenous rhythms from Ecuador and Peru to make them danceable.</p>
<p>Guerrero eventually made it to Tierra Canela and still wears red hair extensions. The 31-year-old says that she plans to withdraw from the group soon — to avoid being kicked out for being "too old." The group's managers prefer its members, who are often supporting their families, conceal their real ages and not disclose whether they're mothers or if they have boyfriends in interviews.</p>

<div class="article-title">Ecuador: La reinvención andina de la cumbia</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p><em>Esta cobertura es parte de una serie especial, </em><em>Cumbia across Latin America</em><em>, un reportaje visual en seis países documentado durante varios años, que abarca seis países y cubre a las personas, lugares y culturas que mantienen vivo este género musical.</em></p>
<p>La primera cumbia grabada en Ecuador a finales de la década de 1960 tenía solo una estrofa. Se llamaba "Cumbia Triste" y fue escrita por Polibio Mayorga. Este músico de Ambato, Ecuador, tropicalizó la música nacional de la Sierra ecuatoriana, que había sido estigmatizada por considerarse demasiado triste o demasiado indígena. Mayorga combinó los ritmos del sanjuanito —música tradicional andina— con la cumbia rural colombiana, que llegó a Ecuador a través de la industria discográfica, ya procesada y blanqueada. El resultado marcó una nueva identidad para muchos migrantes provincianos que llegaron a poblar los centros urbanos del país.</p>
<p>Mientras Polibio Mayorga sentó las bases del sonido de la cumbia ecuatoriana, fueron músicos como Medardo Luzuriaga quienes transformaron el género en una sensación nacional. Su hijo, Manuel Luzuriaga, forma parte de la orquesta de cumbia Los Cumbancheros y, cuando habla de su padre, le brillan los ojos. Medardo fue maestro de Manuel y uno de los músicos más respetados en la historia de las orquestas de cumbia en Ecuador. A fines de los años 60, Medardo creó la orquesta Don Medardo y sus Players. Grabó más de 100 discos, y sus cumbias emblemáticas, como "Cumbia Chonera" y "La Novia", aún viven en la conciencia colectiva del país. Muchos de sus hijos y nietos fundaron varias orquestas tras su muerte, todas ellas siguen tocando su repertorio dorado.</p>
<p>Estefanny Guerrero quiso ser una "Canelita" desde los cinco años. Con sus botas y extensiones rojas sobre la mesa, cantaba las canciones de Tierra Canela, un grupo femenino de tecnocumbia que recluta jóvenes de todo el país. Miles participaron en la última convocatoria para encontrar nuevas integrantes. Algunos músicos y espectadores critican al grupo, diciendo que solo son caras bonitas y cuerpos sexys, pero ellas pasan largas horas en clases de canto y baile, y saben animar a cualquier público.

<div class="article-title">Tackles, projectiles and gunfire: Many fear ICE tactics are growing more violent</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>

<p>There are countless videos on social media showing similar scenes. One, filmed by a photographer in Hyattsville, Md., shows a man pinned to the ground by two ICE officers. He pleads in Spanish and English for someone to help him.</p> <p>During the incident, one of the officers drops his gun and fumbles for it. Then, he appears to point it at bystanders. Emily Covington, an assistant director in ICE's Office of Public Affairs, told NPR in a statement that drawing a weapon can be used as a de-escalation tactic.</p> <p>Another video, from Broadview, Ill., near Chicago, appears to show a man outside an ICE facility getting shot in the head with a pepper ball, a projectile filled with chemical irritants. That man, Pastor David Black, has sued the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Late last month, a local CBS reporter said a masked ICE agent fired a pepper ball at her car at that same facility, causing her to vomit for hours. The reporter, Asal Rezaei, said there was no protest happening at the time. Broadview Police are now investigating.</p> <p>"These are just the tip of the iceberg," says Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. "People being tackled, people getting pepper sprayed or tear gassed. We've seen people getting threatened. And we've seen at least two incidents involving gunfire."</p> <p>A majority of Americans do not approve of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics, according to a recent survey from <em>The New York Times</em> and Siena University. Yet in Chicago, immigrant advocate groups say federal immigration officers are escalating those tactics and becoming more violent.</p> <p>"This administration overall seems more interested in heightening the tensions instead of trying to ramp them down," Tsao says.</p> <p>In late September, federal officers broke down doors and arrested dozens of people during a massive apartment raid on Chicago's south side.</p> <p>Earlier this month, federal officers shot a woman in the city, and a few weeks before, they killed a man in a nearby suburb. In both shootings, officials at the Department of Homeland Security said the victims threatened officers. But in body camera footage from the fatal shooting, the officer who responded says his injuries are "nothing major."</p>
<p>In the case of the woman, her lawyer says officer body camera footage from the incident contradicts that narrative, too. On Thursday, a grand jury indicted her and another man, alleging that they "impeded, intimidated and interfered" with the duties of a federal officer.</p> <p>"What we're seeing is a general escalation of violence and the use of excessive force by ICE officers," says Ed Yohnka, director of communications and public policy at the ACLU of Illinois, which has brought a lawsuit against the Trump administration for violating the constitutional rights of protesters.</p> <p>In Covington's statement to NPR, she said ICE officers are "highly trained and act accordingly with law and policy." The statement also cited a sharp increase in assaults against ICE officers, though reporting from Colorado Public Radio suggests those claims are overblown.</p> <p>Gil Kerlikowske, the former commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection during the Obama administration, says federal immigration officers are not prepared for what is being asked of them.</p> <p>"They do not have the training or skillset or experience to police an urban environment," says Kerlikowske, who was also the police chief in Seattle and police commissioner in Buffalo, N.Y.</p> <p>Good policing in cities, he says, relies on de-escalation, trust and public cooperation. The show of force federal agents are using in Chicago and elsewhere is unnecessary, he says.</p> <p>"These are tactics and strategies that are clearly not needed to be able to do their job," Kerlikowske says. "I couldn't be more disappointed."</p> <p>Courts have weighed in on the amount of force a police officer — whether they're local, state or federal — can legally use, and determined that any use-of-force must be "objectively reasonable."</p> <p>"What does it mean to be objectively reasonable? That term by itself doesn't actually mean anything without context," says Seth Stoughton, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who trains police officers.</p>
<p>DHS, which includes ICE, uses that standard. The agency's most recent use-of-force policy notes that officers should only use force when "no reasonably effective, safe and feasible alternative appears to exist." Among the agency's principles are "de-escalation" and "respect for human life."</p> <p>For use of force to be constitutional, there must be a valid threat. But threats can range from someone with a gun, to someone resisting arrest, to many scenarios in between. How police respond to a situation also must be proportional to the danger of the situation.</p> <p>"We look at the situation through the lens of the reasonable officer on the scene," adds Stoughton. "It might be perfectly reasonable for an officer to step in front of someone, raise a hand and say, 'Stop. I need to talk to you.' And it would be totally unreasonable for the officer to put a gun in that person's face and say, 'Stop or I'm going to shoot you.'"</p> <p>Many uses of force can be legally justified, but Stoughton says just because officers can do something doesn't mean they should.</p> <p>"I don't think most people are asking the question, is this action in this particular video consistent or inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment?" Stoughton says, referring to the law that governs searches and seizures, which also protects against excessive force. "I think what they're asking is, is this a socially and democratically legitimate police action? And that's a very different question than whether it's a legal police action."</p> <p>Immigrant rights groups in Chicago, including the ACLU of Illinois, say federal agents are violating the law – by using "violent force" against protesters and others.</p> <p>Because of that, they say it's important for bystanders to document what they witness, which helps make questions of force a little less open for interpretation.</p>
