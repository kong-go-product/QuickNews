                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Country star Raul Malo shared that his battle against stage 4 colon cancer has "taken a turn," revealing he was recently diagnosed with a rare complication of the disease.</p><p>On Wednesday, the 60-year-old Mavericks frontman, who first disclosed his cancer diagnosis in June 2024, announced on social media that he has developed leptomeningeal disease (LMD). According to the Cleveland Clinic, LMD is an incurable condition in which cancer cells spread from an advanced cancer to the cerebrospinal fluid and the membranes around the brain and spinal cord.</p><p>Malo explained in an Instagram post that The Mavericks canceled their remaining 2025 tour dates, except for two December shows, so he can focus on his health.</p><p>"I want to update you all on my health, as things have taken a turn," Malo wrote alongside a video in which he was seen sitting in a chair and playing a guitar.</p><p>"As it goes with cancer, it’s a very unpredictable and indiscriminatory disease," the Grammy Award winner continued. "I’ve developed something called LMD, which stands for 'get this s--- out of my head.' Treatment for this is radiation, which I will start tomorrow."</p><p>"We will probably jump into some chemo, and are even looking at alternative therapies," Malo added. "But it’s time to take your words to heart of resting &amp; recovering, so that’s what I’m going to do."</p><p>While Malo shared that "all shows going forward are canceled," he promised fans The Mavericks will "continue doing cool projects, releasing live recordings, merchandise, Trovador and so forth."</p><p>The Mavericks have been touring with Dwight Yoakam on the country star's Cosmic Roundup &amp; Rodeo Tour but recently canceled or postponed several dates due to Malo's health struggles.</p><p>"I want to thank Dwight Yoakam, his band, and crew for their kindness and understanding this year, and sorry we couldn’t finish the tour the way we planned," Malo wrote.</p><p>However, Malo told fans to "hang on to your tickets" for the band's two shows at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium on Dec. 5 and 6, noting they are "planning something special" and will share details soon.</p><p>The "Dance the Night Away" hitmaker also assured fans he is "in no way alone, or scared."</p><p>"I have an amazing wife and boys, wonderful family, team, road crew, band, friends and fans," he wrote. "I don’t even have enough words to describe the love and support that I’m getting right now."</p><p>"To my friends who have sent me texts and messages, I want you to know that I’ve read them all," he continued. "I can’t return them all, but your love, prayers, and well wishes have not gone unnoticed."</p><p>Malo also reflected on how he plans to approach his cancer battle moving forward and vowed to share more updates.</p><p>"We don’t know what this will look like a couple months from now, but we are going into it like we have with everything else," he said. "Full steam ahead. Fight, recover, rest, repeat."</p><p>"I want to thank you all for your incredible support through all this, and sorry about the cancellations but we have no choice anymore," Malo continued. "Find kindness &amp; empathy out there wherever you can. Humans are alright, even if you don’t believe it from what you see on TV."</p></body></div></body></html>

The suspect will be turned over to the Southport Police Department for questioning.</p><p>"We don't feel like there's any additional threats to the community right now," Southport Police Chief Todd Coring told reporters during a press conference.

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Eric Dane's wife, Rebecca Gayheart, shared an update on how their family is coping following the actor's amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diagnosis. </p><p>The 52-year-old "Grey's Anatomy" alum announced in April he was battling ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. During an interview with People magazine published Saturday, Gayheart, 54, explained that she and the couple's two daughters, Billie, 15, and Georgia, 13, were "taking it day by day."</p><p>"We have some professional therapists who are helping us, and we're just trying to have some hope and do it with dignity, grace and love," the "Once Upon A Time in Hollywood" star said. </p><p>"I mean, it's heartbreaking," Gayheart continued. "My girls are really suffering, and we're just trying to get through it. It's a tough time."</p><p>Dane revealed his diagnosis in a statement that he shared with People.</p><p>"I am grateful to have my loving family by my side as we navigate this next chapter," he said. "I kindly ask that you give my family and I privacy during this time."</p><p>Dane and Gayheart began dating in 2003, and tied the knot in October 2004. In 2018, Gayheart filed for divorce from Dane, citing "irreconcilable differences." However, she filed a request to dismiss her divorce petition in March — one month before Dane revealed his diagnosis. </p><p>During her new interview with People, Gayheart admitted that she has struggled with maintaining a positive mindset amid Dane's health struggles. </p><p>"I don't think I'm at a place yet where I can pull out a positive nugget. I'm not there yet," she said. </p><p>Gayheart continued, "I mean, we're definitely dealing with something that has brought us all together, and Eric will always be my family, whether we're married or not, or living in the same house or not, but yeah, we are closer, but we don't like the reason why."</p><p>"It's a horrible disease, and I wish that there was a cure," she added. "I hope they find one soon, because it is just so sad."</p><p>In a June interview with People, Dane became emotional as he shared how Gayheart has supported him during his battle with ALS. </p><p>"I call Rebecca. I talk to her every day," the "Euphoria" star said as he teared up. "We have managed to become better friends and better parents. And she is probably my biggest champion, my most stalwart supporter, and I lean on her."</p><p>Dane has previously shared that he was celebrating his "good" days as he contends with his health challenges.</p><p>"Today I'm doing great," Dane told Fox News Digital in June. "I'm approaching this thing one day at a time, and today's a good day. So, that's a win." </p><p>During a June interview with Diane Sawyer on "Good Morning America," Dane detailed a few of the heartbreaking effects of the neurodegenerative disease, some of which included losing function in his limbs.</p><p>"I have one functioning arm," he said. "My left side is functioning. My right side has completely stopped working. [My left arm] is going. I feel like maybe a couple, a few more months, and I won’t have my left hand either. It's sobering."</p><p>While speaking with Sawyer, Dane explained how he's found hope in Dr. Merit Cudkowicz, the physician who has been leading his care.</p><p>"I'm very hopeful. ... I don't think this is the end of my story," he said. "And whether it is or it isn't, I'm gonna carry that idea with me.</p><p>"That's what I got from Merit when I met her. … There was a sense of hope I didn't get from other doctors that I met with," Dane added.</p><p>Dane said he had spoken previously with an organization that told him his doctors would be "there to ... monitor my decline — and that's not very helpful."</p><p>Cudkowicz said the risk factors behind the disease can include anything from environmental concerns like plastics and bacteria in lakes to sports injuries. </p><p>While the "Countdown" star may have physical setbacks, he refuses to let his diagnosis derail his career. </p><p>"I'm going to ride this till the wheels fall off," he told E! News.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Portland Mayor Keith Wilson on Saturday dismissed President Donald Trump’s plan to send federal troops to Oregon's largest city, claiming there is no lawlessness or violence there.</p><p>Trump announced Saturday morning he plans to send troops to Portland at the request of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.</p><p>The president said he directed War Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide "all necessary troops to protect war-ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists," adding he was authorizing full force, if necessary.</p><p>Hours later, Wilson said during a news conference the number of necessary troops is "zero" in Portland, "and any other American city."</p><p>"This is an American city," Wilson said. "We do not need any intervention. This is not a military target."</p><p>The mayor alleged the president would "not find" lawlessness or violence in the city, claiming video footage showing violence in the city was from five years ago was "recycled and then recycled again."</p><p>"If President Trump came to Portland today, what he would find is people riding their bikes, playing sports, enjoying the sunshine, buying groceries or produce from a farmers' market," Wilson said. "We've had hard conversations, and we've done important work in the years since that footage was taken, we reformed our public safety system. We've refocused our community and on our economy, and we've redoubled our efforts to help our most vulnerable."</p><p>Since June, protests have erupted near an ICE facility in Portland, where city officials cited land use violations, including improper detainee holding times and boarded-up windows. </p><p>The building has been vandalized with anti-ICE graffiti and clashes between protesters and federal agents have occasionally turned violent, leading to the use of rubber bullets, tear gas and flash bangs. </p><p>Video obtained by Fox News Digital confirmed another violent protest in August, with footage showing protesters rolling out a guillotine, lighting fires and fighting with authorities — forcing law enforcement to disperse the crowd with munitions.</p><p>Instead of sending troops to protect the federal facility, Wilson suggested the president send "hundreds of engineers, or teachers, or outreach workers" to Portland instead of a "short, expensive and fruitless show of force."</p><p>"I am so deeply disappointed with the federal government's irresponsibility," he said. "At the end of the day, this may be a show of force, but that's all it is. It's a big show, and after the big show, everyone goes home. That's what I want to happen here today in Portland. We have a long and proud tradition of peaceful protest. We have a long and proud track record of being at the forefront of positive social change."</p><p>"There are new risks today, risks that we do not yet fully understand," he continued. "The administration has refused to elaborate on what they mean when they say they will deploy full force against our city and citizens."</p><p>In his announcement on Saturday, Trump did not say he would deploy full force against the city of Portland and its citizens, as Wilson claimed. </p><p>The president said he would send "all necessary troops" to protect the city and its ICE facilities, authorizing full force against domestic terrorism "if necessary."</p><p>Portland, a sanctuary city since 2017, has resisted federal immigration enforcement, making it a focal point during the administration's immigration enforcement initiative.</p><p>In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Wilson, warning the city’s sanctuary policies undermine U.S. interests. She demanded Portland affirm compliance with federal law and end practices that obstruct immigration enforcement.</p><p>The City of Portland did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Granger Smith's wife, Amber Smith, is opening up about a devastating chapter in their lives. </p><p>The 46-year-old former country star and 42-year-old actress suffered a tragedy in 2019 when their 3-year-old son River drowned in the pool outside their Texas home.</p><p>Granger previously revealed in his 2023 memoir "Like a River" that he almost took his own life after reaching one of his lowest points following the loss of his son.  </p><p>In her forthcoming memoir "The Girl on the Bathroom Floor," Amber recounted the harrowing night of Granger's near-suicide attempt from her perspective, detailing how her husband "put a cold Glock 9mm into his mouth." She also said that he told her years later how close he was to pulling the trigger.</p><p>"He was out with the guys in Boise, Idaho, one night after a show," Amber began in an excerpt of the book published by People magazine on Thursday.</p><p>"They walked over to the local bar, laughed, and told old stories, all while drinking more than he had since River died," she continued. "When the evening wrapped up, he found himself drunkenly walking back to his tour bus alone."</p><p>Amber wrote that when Granger returned, he struggled to get onto the tour bus as he couldn’t recall the door code – a set of numbers he had pressed hundreds of times.</p><p>Once inside the bus, Granger "realized the severity of the situation" because he "hadn't been drunk in a really long time."</p><p>"Fearing that this would cause all the emotions and pain to come flooding back, he quickly grabbed for the weed pen and took a hit, hoping it would bring him out of his drunken state a bit, but nothing changed," Amber wrote.</p><p>Amber described how her husband became overwhelmed by the "slideshow" of tormenting mental images of their son's final moments. </p><p>"Visions of River facedown in the pool assaulted his thoughts and lies pierced his conscience that he was a failure as a father, that he had let River down," she continued. "In a moment of utter despair, he fumbled for the gun he kept in the drawer by his bed for safety on the road, aiming to end the pain."</p><p>"That night my sweet, incredible husband, the wonderful father of my kids, put a cold Glock 9mm into his mouth."</p><p>Amber shared that she is still wrestling with grief over her husband's struggle with suicide during that dark moment.</p><p>"I cry even typing this," she wrote. "It breaks my heart that he felt like this was the only way out. I wish I had known. I wish I could have grabbed him, shaken him, and said, ‘You’re a good father! I love you! We’ve got this! This isn’t the way!’ </p><p>"But I didn’t have to," she continued. "By the sheer grace of God, Granger became aware that the voice quietly telling him to pull the trigger wasn’t his own. He realized suddenly that he was under attack. He was engulfed in spiritual warfare."</p><p>Amber wrote that Granger, who is now a minister, turned to his faith during that moment of crisis.  </p><p>"He did the only thing he knew to do, crying out, ‘Jesus, save me! Save me, please, Jesus, save me!’" she wrote in the book. "In that moment of crying out to God, the visions suddenly stopped, the gun slipped out of his hand and he collapsed to the floor, falling asleep in a puddle of his own tears, fully clothed on the bathroom floor of his bus."</p><p>Amber recalled that Granger texted her the following morning, saying he had had "an awful night," drank too much and "came face to face with Satan."</p><p>"He never shared with me that he came so close to pulling the trigger," she wrote. "Not until three and a half years later."</p><p>In April 2024, Smith announced on Instagram that he had decided to retire from country music and his summer "Like A River" tour, which was named for his late son, would be his last.</p><p>In an interview with Entertainment Tonight in August 2024, Granger recalled that he thought of his two older children — daughter London, now 14, and son Lincoln, now 11 — during the moment he was contemplating suicide.</p><p>"I had one thought and it was Lincoln and London, my two kids at home. That was the first thought that hit me," he said. "I thought I just saw their faces and then I said, 'Jesus, help me.'"</p><p>He explained that surrendering to his faith in that moment set him on his path to becoming a minister. </p><p>"I said, 'Jesus, save me,' and suddenly I felt life sort of stop for the first time," Granger said. "The slideshow stopped. I slid the gun out of my hand and it hit the bank and I fell down on the floor and I was crying and I was horrified at my shame and my guilt and the weakness I was and the lack of strength that I had and the weak man I that I was. It all hit me at once and that was the beginning."</p><p>Since River's death, Granger and Amber, who welcomed their youngest son Maverick in August 2021, have become outspoken advocates for children's water safety.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Scientists from Australia are touting the results of bite-resistant wetsuit materials to reduce deaths from shark attacks.</p><p>Researchers from Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia, tested four wetsuit materials — Aqua Armour, Shark Stop, ActionTX-S and Brewster — inviting white and tiger sharks to bite the material as it was dragged behind a boat. </p><p>Tiger and white sharks are the two species responsible for the most unprovoked shark attacks.</p><p>"It’s not the entire suit, right, they’ve only used that special material in special parts of the suit, and it’s designed to protect you in the places that are most dangerous for blood loss and protect the major arteries," Nick Whitney, a senior scientist at the New England Aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life in Boston told the Associated Press. </p><p>Whitney was not involved in the study. </p><p>While the scientists found that catastrophic injuries could still occur, all four materials were found to lessen damage from shark bites. </p><p>Whitney noted that most people bitten by sharks die from blood loss, not from being eaten or carried away. </p><p>"It’s typically a bite and release so they bleed to death," he explained. "So, the goal of these suits is to protect you in specific areas and buy extra time for you to get to the beach and get to lifeguards and get medical assistance."</p><p>Chainmail wetsuits were created in the 1970s, but the researchers said that they didn’t offer the flexibility of movement necessary for activities like surfing and diving. </p><p>"New wetsuits that incorporate strong and light fibre often used in sailing rope, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, offer both flexibility and protection, making them more suitable for recreational use," the researchers said. </p><p>Dr. Thomas Clarke, of the College of Science and Engineering at Flinders University and study co-author, said that "While there were small differences between the four tested materials, they all reduced the amount of substantial and critical damage, which would typically be associated with severe haemorrhaging and tissue or limb loss." </p><p>The findings were published on Thursday in the journal Wildlife Research.</p><p>"Our study showed that bite-resistant materials incorporated into wetsuits can reduce damage from large white and tiger sharks (up to 3 metres) compared to standard neoprene wetsuit, even from moderate and severe bites," Clarke added. </p><p>Flinders University Professor Charlie Huveneers, study co-author who leads the Southern Shark Ecology Group, said that while the suits don’t eliminate the risk from sharks, "our results indicate that they can reduce blood loss and trauma from major lacerations and punctures, potentially saving lives."</p><p>The researchers concluded that all four materials "offer an improved level of protection that can reduce severe wounds and blood loss, and should be considered as part of the toolbox and measures available to reduce shark-bite risk and resulting injuries."</p><p>There were fewer than 50 unprovoked shark attacks globally last year, with most of the attacks in the U.S. happening in Florida. </p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump plans to meet with congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle on Monday, as a possible government shutdown looms, a White House official confirmed to Fox News. </p><p>The meeting comes after the president canceled one last week with Democrats, claiming they had "unserious and ridiculous demands." </p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., were set to meet with Trump on Thursday to discuss a path forward to avert a partial government shutdown before the Sept. 30 deadline.</p><p>Schumer and Jeffries will now meet with Trump, along with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. </p><p>Schumer and Jeffries put out a joint statement on Saturday on the rescheduled meeting. </p><p>"President Trump has once again agreed to a meeting in the Oval Office," the statement said. "As we have repeatedly said, Democrats will meet anywhere, at any time and with anyone to negotiate a bipartisan spending agreement that meets the needs of the American people. We are resolute in our determination to avoid a government shutdown and address the Republican healthcare crisis. Time is running out."</p><p>The Senate is expected to return on Sept. 29 following the Jewish new year, and the House is expected to be out until the deadline to keep the government funded passes.</p><p>In a lengthy post on Truth Social last week, Trump blasted Schumer and Jeffries for pushing "radical Left policies that nobody voted for." </p><p>"I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive," Trump added at the time. </p><p>The now-canceled meeting with Trump came on the heels of a letter from Schumer and Jeffries sent over that weekend where the top congressional Democrats laid the possibility of a shutdown on his and Republicans’ feet.</p><p>They argued that the Trump-backed short-term extension was "dirty," which would mean it had partisan policy riders or spending attached to it, and panned it for continuing "the Republican assault on healthcare," ignoring expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium subsidies, and possibly leading to the closure of hospitals and other healthcare facilities across the country.</p><p>"With the September 30th deadline fast approaching, Republicans will bear responsibility for another painful government shutdown because of the refusal of GOP congressional leadership to even talk with Democrats," they wrote at the time.</p><p>But Trump argued that their bill would allow for the nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts in his "Big, Beautiful Bill" to be repealed, and also blasted the Democratic continuing resolution (CR) for ending his bill's $50 billion rural hospital fund. </p><p>"We must keep the Government open, and legislate like true Patriots rather than hold American Citizens hostage, knowing that they want our now thriving Country closed," he said. </p><p>"I’ll be happy to meet with them if they agree to the Principles in this Letter," Trump continued. "They must do their job! Otherwise, it will just be another long and brutal slog through their radicalized quicksand. To the Leaders of the Democrat Party, the ball is in your court. I look forward to meeting with you when you become realistic about the things that our Country stands for. DO THE RIGHT THING!"</p><p>Without any action, a shutdown would start at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday.</p><p>Johnson said last week that he had encouraged Trump to cancel the meeting last Thursday. </p><p>"He and I talked about it at length yesterday and the day before. I said, look, when they get their job done, once they do the basic governing work of keeping the government open, as president, then you can have a meeting with him," Johnson said on the "Mike &amp; McCarty Show." "Of course, it might be productive at that point, but right now, this is just a waste of his time."</p><p><i>Fox News' Alex Miller and Elizabeth Elkind and the Associated Press contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> As the Sept. 30 government funding deadline looms, the Trump administration is warning that millions of Americans could lose flood insurance coverage if Democrats refuse to back a House-passed spending bill that also extends the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).</p><p>The White House supports the continuing resolution (CR) approved by House Republicans, which would avert a shutdown and reauthorize the NFIP. </p><p>Administration officials said they worked to ensure NFIP was part of the current funding package, reflecting what they call the urgency of protecting millions of policyholders during hurricane season.</p><p>Democrats have said they will not support the measure, citing broader spending disputes. Trump administration officials argue the standoff puts homeowners, the housing market and disaster recovery funds at risk just as peak storm season arrives.</p><p>"In an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital, a White House official said: ‘The NFIP is a vital program utilized by millions of Americans, and it’s not a hard call to extend it – which is exactly why the administration supports the House-passed CR that would do so. Unfortunately, Democrats are happy to shut down the government and hurt the many thousands of Americans who rely on this program in the process.’"</p><p>According to administration figures reviewed by Fox News Digital, a lapse in NFIP authorization could disrupt about 1,300 property sales every day. That’s roughly 40,000 closings in a single month, all in areas where flood insurance is required to secure a mortgage.</p><p>More than 400,000 policies are set to expire in October. Officials say about 152,000 of those have been prepaid, but more than 250,000 households could still lose coverage if the program stalls.</p><p>Administration officials also pointed to October 2024 as a warning sign. That month saw more than 427,000 new or renewed policies. Roughly 41,000 homeowners bought new policies while about 33,000 dropped coverage, leaving a net gain of nearly 9,000. Officials warn that similar growth this year could collapse if NFIP lapses.</p><p>Administration officials told Fox News Digital that FEMA currently has $2.6 billion available to pay valid claims, including $1.5 billion in the National Flood Insurance Fund and $1.1 billion in reserves. But they warned the agency would be unable to borrow additional money from the Treasury if a major disaster exceeded those reserves, a scenario they described as "dangerous and avoidable."</p><p>The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) echoed those concerns. </p><p>"Past disruptions of the NFIP have caused immediate and widespread negative impacts on property sales, home values and consumer confidence," NAHB said in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital.</p><p>"Home sales would cease in areas where flood insurance is mandatory in order to obtain a mortgage. What the housing market needs now is stability and certainty. NAHB calls upon the House to act quickly to continue to fund the operations of the federal government including the extension of the NFIP."</p><p>The NFIP has a long history of stopgap extensions. Since 2017, Congress has reauthorized the program more than 30 times, often through short-term measures. Lawmakers have typically made coverage retroactive to prevent permanent gaps, but even brief lapses have stalled real estate closings and left homeowners in limbo. The program currently serves about 4.5 million policyholders nationwide.</p><p>Unless lawmakers strike a deal, FEMA will be barred from selling or renewing flood insurance policies starting Oct. 1, a lapse that could leave millions of homeowners in limbo as Washington hurtles toward a shutdown. Administration officials argue the risk is especially acute this year as hurricane season continues.</p><p>FEMA, Schumer and Jeffries did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

The Lynx are scheduled to play Game 4 of their semifinals series on Sunday.</p><p>Late in the fourth quarter of Game 3 against the Phoenix Mercury, Reeve was seen aggressively pursuing a referee. After the pursuit, Reeve appeared to engage in a verbal altercation with the game official. </p><p>After her ejection, the Lynx head coach refused to leave the court in a reasonable timeframe. There were just over 21 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter at the time Reeve was tossed.</p><p>Reeve also appeared to direct comments toward fans as she eventually left the court.</p><p>After the Lynx suffered an 84-76 loss to the Mercury, Reeve went on a lengthy rant in the postgame press conference.</p><p>In her postgame rant, Reeve called for the WNBA to make changes at the league level when it comes to officiating.</p><p>"If this is what the league wants, OK, but I want to call for a change of leadership at the league level when it comes to officiating," Reeve said. "The officiating crew that we had tonight, for the leadership to deem those three people semifinal-playoff worthy, it's f---ing malpractice."</p><p>Isaac Barnett, Randy Richardson and Jenna Reneau were the three game officials from Friday night.</p><p>Minnesota assistant coaches Eric Thibault and Rebekkah Brunson also were fined by the league.

Catch this!" an apparent nod to writing that was written on bullet casings linked to Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's Sept. 10 assassination. </p><p>"I posted this flyer our team spotted at Georgetown, and now we find out professors at "elite" schools are members of this group and its offshoots," Kolvet wrote in the post.

That is not the proper role of FBI agents, and Wray was not forthcoming about what happened when he testified numerous times on Capitol Hill, Director Kash Patel said.</p><p>"Agents were sent into a crowd control mission after the riot was declared by Metro Police – something that goes against FBI standards," Patel told Fox News Digital. "This was the failure of a corrupt leadership that lied to Congress and to the American people about what really happened."</p><p>He added, "Thanks to agents coming forward, we are now uncovering the truth. We are fully committed to transparency, and justice and accountability continues with this FBI." </p><p>There’s no indication any FBI agents were involved in any events related to Trump’s speech on the morning of Jan. 6 at the Ellipse, an FBI official told Fox News Digital, adding that Wray should have disclosed that agents were there when he was asked by congressional leaders.</p><p>President Donald Trump, citing a report that the agents were in the crowd which did not make clear their mission, said earlier that Wray, "has some major explaining to do."</p><p>"It was just revealed that the FBI had secretly placed, against all Rules, Regulations, Protocols, and Standards, 274 FBI Agents into the Crowd just prior to, and during, the January 6th Hoax," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday afternoon following a report from The Blaze, revealing the number of agents that were there. </p><p>Trump added, "This is different from what Director Christopher Wray stated, over and over again! That’s right, as it now turns out, FBI Agents were at, and in, the January 6th Protest, probably acting as Agitators and Insurrectionists, but certainly not as ‘Law Enforcement Officials.’"</p><p>The president said he wanted to know each officer’s identity and what they were doing at the U.S. Capitol. </p><p>"Many Great American Patriots were made to pay a very big price only for the love of their Country," he said, referring to Trump supporters who faced charges for their involvement on Jan. 6.</p><p>Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of every person charged for involvement on Jan. 6 after he took office this year. </p><p>He concluded, "I owe this investigation of ‘Dirty Cops and Crooked Politicians' to them! Christopher Wray, the then Director of the FBI, has some major explaining to do. That’s two in a row, Comey and Wray, who got caught LYING, with our Great Country at stake. WE CAN NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN TO AMERICA AGAIN!" </p><p>Citing a senior congressional source, the Blaze report said that the number of agents wasn’t "necessarily a surprise" because the FBI often "embeds countersurveillance personnel at large events."</p><p>Wray told a House Committee on Nov. 15, 2023, "If you are asking if the violence at the Capitol was part of some operation orchestrated by FBI sources or agents, the answer is no," but he wouldn’t disclose if any agents or sources were embedded within the crowd. </p><p>The 274 agents also includes those who were responding to the pipe bombs placed near the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters the night before Jan. 6, according to Politico. </p><p>Trump nominated Wray as FBI director in 2017 after he fired former FBI director James Comey, who was just indicted by a grand jury this week for allegedly making false statements to Congress. </p><p>A report released last December by Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz said: "We found no evidence in the materials we reviewed or the testimony we received showing or suggesting that the FBI had undercover employees in the various protest crowds, or at the Capitol, on January 6," although he acknowledged there were 26 paid informants, but only three of them were assigned by the FBI to be there.</p><p>The report also said that FBI personnel were sent to the Capitol at the request of overwhelmed Capitol Police to help with crowd control. </p><p>Horowitz said that none of the informants were allowed to incite the crowd, break the law or enter the U.S. Capitol. </p><p>In its reporting, Blaze noted that there may have been confusion regarding "plainclothes" and "undercover," meaning both the inspector general and the FBI could be telling the truth. </p><p>Many of the agents weren't happy to have been sent to the Capitol to do crowd control, another official told Fox News Digital. It was a chaotic scene with no pre-planning that contradicted the agency's original plan to not get involved in the event. The official said that agents are not trained to do crowd control. </p><p>The first agents arrived at the Capitol around 2:30 p.m. — there's no evidence there were any there before a riot was declared — and agents continued to arrive after that, the official added. </p><p>Wray had testified before Congress prior to the inspector general's report being released in December, but Patel called out Wray for deflecting and giving a "D.C. answer" when pressed by lawmakers. </p><p>"Why it took a ton of time and questioning in Congress for the director to get that point is what I'm trying to eliminate from the FBI," Patel said. "If Congress asks you a question under oath, whether or not there were sources in [or] around Jan. 6th at the Capitol, you as the director of the FBI need to know that and not deflect and give a D.C. answer. You have to be prepared for that."</p><p><i>Fox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>"Warning: The black course is an extremely difficult course we recommend only for European golfers."</p><p>That's what the infamous sign upon entering Bethpage Black might as well say after Day Two of the Ryder Cup in Farmingdale.</p><p>After a 3-1 showing in the morning, the Euros fought through the taunts of fans and tensions inside the ropes to grab another three points to the Americans' one in the afternoon session and expand their lead to 11.5-4.5.</p><p></p><p>With a chance for the USA to steal the final match on 18, Tyrrell Hatton and Matt Fitzpatrick stuck their iron shots to inside three feet, while Sam Burns and Patrick Cantlay were ways away, changing all the momentum brought by J.J. Spaun just minutes earlier after he birdied 18 to win his match.</p><p>The early talk of this year's Ryder Cup had been that the United States would have incredible home-field advantage. Apparently, it's been anything but, yet the crowds were attempting to do their part. However, some may have crossed lines.</p><p>Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry heard it from fans all day. McIlroy was spotted telling a fan to "shut the f--- up" in the morning session. Lowry had to be held back by a caddie on the 10th tee and asked security to escort a fan away. Lowry also backed off a shot twice as fans were counting the seconds he took to swing. On six, he stared down a particular fan after dropping a putt to halve a hole. He even dropped a "f--- you" to a fan after eagling the fourth.</p><p>Golf Digest reported that, through four holes, there were 30 F-bombs directed toward McIlroy. Plenty of other insults about his Irish heritage and even his performance at Pinehurst No. 2 in the 2024 U.S. Open were heard. A fan was threatened with ejection by security on the 15th green after swearing at McIlroy.</p><p>In more playful banter, this time at 16, again in the afternoon, a fan chirped McIlroy by saying he is "not that good." McIlroy promptly responded, "I'm really f---ing good" and smoked a drive down the middle.</p><p>European captain Luke Donald stayed relatively melancholy when discussing the Long Island crowd but made note of when fans do "cross the line."</p><p>"It was loud. It was raucous. What I consider crossing the line is personal insults and making sounds when they are trying to hit on their backswings or very close to when they are trying to go into their routines. That did happen a little bit. It's happened at other Ryder Cups, too," he said. "It's something we prepared for, and I can see, I think, how well they have dealt with it.</p><p>"I think people have individually different ways to deal with it. But, you know, crowds have energy, and you can use it however you want. It's however you frame it. There's a stimulus, a response, and in between that is how you decide what you want to do with it, okay. I think some people find that motivating. So, you know, sometimes the crowd going at you can be a motivator for some of these players, and I think Rory and Shane certainly looked like they were sort of almost enjoying the difficult environment out there."</p><p>It was not just the fans exchanging pleasantries with the players, though.</p><p>Bryson DeChambeau and Tommy Fleetwood got into it on the 15th green, as caddies also began to share pleasantries following Justin Rose lining up a putt. But Keegan Bradley said the beef was squashed shortly afterward.</p><p>"In sports, golf, it's blown into this huge thing. It happens in sports all the time," Bradley said. "They seemed fine after the round. You know, it's super passionate out there, especially for — well, for both sides. But from what I understand, everything was fine after the round. These sort of things happen when you're playing for your country."</p><p>Fleetwood then earned his fourth point in as many matches this weekend on the very next hole, as his partner Justin Rose birdied to win the match, 3 &amp; 2. Fleetwood is now 11-3-2 in his Ryder Cup career, the best record by any Euro with at least 10 matches played.</p><p>While Fleetwood is a Ryder Cup legend, world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is anything but. He is 0-4-0 this weekend and became the first player since 1971 to lose his first three matches and then go back out for a fourth on Saturday.</p><p>Facing the largest deficit entering Sunday under the current 28-point format (since 1979), the United States needs 10 points to win the Ryder Cup. That would be the most points ever scored by one team in the event's history, and only 12 are available in Sunday singles.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>For some adults, their hobby is fantasy football. For others, it is Broadway shows, day-trading or maybe pickleball.</p><p>But for another passionate group of Americans — with or without kids of their own — it's all about Disney.</p><p>A recent article labeled Disney enthusiasts "the most hated group online" and such criticism often comes with viral anecdotes, like a 2022 Reddit post from a couple who admitted they skipped catering their wedding to pay for a 30-minute appearance by Mickey and Minnie Mouse.</p><p>The couple may not be alone in their dedication. Roughly 1,500 couples get married at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., each year, according to wedding planners.</p><p>And some fans love Disney until death — literally.</p><p>In the new book "Disney Adults: Exploring (And Falling In Love With) A Magical Subculture," author AJ Wolfe describes visitors who have scattered the ashes of loved ones on rides like the Haunted Mansion, despite repeated warnings from park staff.</p><p>"They take one last trip there before they die," Wolfe writes. "And they even buy funeral urns etched with images of Disney World's Cinderella Castle."</p><p>Disney adults talk about "converting" their loved ones into fans because Disney is a kind of church for them, according to Wolfe, who is also the founder of the Disney Food Blog.</p><p>Wolfe spoke with a San Diego tattoo artist who exclusively inks Disney-related art and a couple who regularly flew from New York City to Disney World for single overnight stays.</p><p>"We max out our credit cards to go," Wolfe wrote of her Disney community. "We count down the days until we can go again and plan obsessively about what we’re going to do, eat, wear, and experience the next time we’re there. We post on social media about how life ceases in between trips."</p><p>Journalists covering the parks have noted more child-free millennials and Gen Xers since the pandemic, with after-hours events, food and cocktails catering to an older crowd.</p><p>In 2023, Walt Disney World drew about 48.8 million visitors, according to reports. Part of Disney's draw lies in its unmatched reputation, said Roy Schwartz, a New York-based pop culture historian and author.</p><p>"Disney is probably the most iconic brand in entertainment," Schwartz told Fox News Digital. "They're the most associated with classic, timeless, innocent stories and characters. That's very appealing to childless adults who're looking for a way to recapture or keep alive that feeling of delight and comfort."</p><p>While Schwartz acknowledges that part of the loyalty is cultivated through savvy corporate strategy, he believes much of it is organic. Adults are searching for community, identity and simple joys, whether it be through Disney, Taylor Swift, CrossFit or political movements.</p><p>Wolfe admits that Disney adults are buying what the multibillion-dollar corporation is selling.</p><p>In her book, she describes "smellizer" machines that pump scents of apple pie, jasmine and roses into the air to entice shoppers in the parks. </p><p>"Everything at Disney is bigger, brighter, and more infused with visuals, smells, feelings, flavors and sounds," she wrote.</p><p>Critics often dismiss Disney fans as people who refuse to grow up, but Wolfe describes Walt Disney World as a safe, predictable escape. </p><p>For her, Disney was still preferable to European, Alaskan or Thai vacations after she became a mother. </p><p>"They spoke English and used American dollars, transportation was simple and urgent care for my asthmatic kid was highly accessible," she wrote.</p><p>Experts agree the appeal is about comfort, connection and fun.</p><p>"Sometimes we need to revisit childlike spaces — like Disney — in order to heal our inner child," Dr. Robyn Koslowitz, a New Jersey-based clinical psychologist and trauma specialist, told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Dr. Debra Kissen, CEO of Light On Anxiety Treatment Centers in Chicago, agreed, calling Disney a "turnkey escape."</p><p>"It offers safety, cleanliness, predictable logistics and a reliable emotional arc," she said. "Adults often use the space more intentionally as a mood reset, a couples ritual or a hobby."</p><p>But that fandom can tip into excess.</p><p>Kissen advises asking, "Is work, sleep or relationships suffering? Are you spending beyond your means or hiding costs? Can you skip an event without distress?</p><p>"If yes to any, it's time to set guardrails — budgets, trip frequency, 'no-park' months, or diversify your hobbies," she said.</p><p>Wolfe told Fox News Digital that her interviews with Disney adults showed her that their fandom isn’t their only defining characteristic. </p><p>"It’s a hobby among many others," she said. "Having an affinity for Disney allows people to process life with a bit more optimism — that you can be strong, grow, be the hero of your own story and that happily ever after can happen."</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New Jersey Democrat candidate for governor Mikie Sherrill has not addressed her congressional voting record on bills related to transgender athletes in women's sports. </p><p>President Donald Trump called out Sherrill for her stance on the issue in a Truth Social post on Thursday. </p><p>"Sherrill wants Open Borders (again!), men playing in Women’s Sports, Transgender for everyone, and all of the things that almost DESTROYED America," Trump wrote.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Sherrill's campaign multiple times for clarification on her stance on the issue of trans athletes in women's sports but has not received a response. </p><p>Sherrill has been the subject of criticism on social media for her congressional voting record on the issue. She voted against the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act twice when the bill was first proposed in 2023 and again in February when it was reintroduced. </p><p>Sherrill also co-sponsored the Equality Act but also co-sponsored the Transgender Bill of Rights, which more explicitly "guarantees certain rights for transgender and nonbinary people with respect to public services and accommodations." </p><p>Sherrill is a self-proclaimed "advocate for women’s athletics."  She previously proposed the Women in NCAA Sports Act in the U.S. House of Representatives alongside Rep. Maria Salazar, D-Fla., and led a resolution to honor Billie Jean King with the Congressional Gold Medal. </p><p>However, she has recently been the subject of criticism on social media for her congressional voting record on the issue of trans athletes in women's sports. </p><p>Former University of Pennsylvania women's swimmer and women's sports activist Paula Scanlan, the first UPenn swimmer to speak up about the school's Lia Thomas controversy in 2022, called out Sherrill on X over the issue this week. </p><p>The New Jersey GOP attacked Sherrill for this record directly in a campaign graphic last week. </p><p>Sherrill's opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, mentioned this issue for Sherrill in a post back in July. </p><p>New Jersey is the original home state of well-known transgender track and field athlete Sadie Schreiner, who previously competed for Rochester Institute for Technology and went viral multiple times for posting videos sharing the athlete's firsthand experience as a biological male trans athlete competing against, and often dominating, females. Schreiner is from Hillsborough, according to the athlete's RIT Athletics page. </p><p>Schreiner has filed a lawsuit against Princeton University for an alleged incident at a May 3 women's race. Schreiner's lawsuit claimed the athlete attempted to participate in the women's 200-meter sprint at the Larry Ellis Invitational as one of the 141 participants unattached to a university or club. The suit alleges officials told Schreiner the athlete could not participate 15 minutes before the race began. </p><p>Schreiner alleged the university violated the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, which designates "gender identity or expression" as a protected status. </p><p>Schreiner has since filed a second lawsuit against SUNY Genesco for being banned from a women's race in March, per multiple reports.</p><p>Back in January, a New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. </p><p>Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women. Among 1,022 Republicans, that number was 94%. </p><p>The 81 independents who were interviewed represented the group with the most reluctance to say transgender athletes shouldn't be allowed to compete. Just 64% said they were against it, while 26% refused to answer. Just 3% of the Democrats and 1% of the Republicans refused to answer.</p><p>Nearly 70% of Americans say biological men should not be permitted to compete in women's sports, according to a Gallup poll last year.</p><p>Additional data suggests the issue impacted the 2024 election. </p><p>A national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America (CWA) legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of "Donald Trump’s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls' and women’s sports and of transgender boys and men using girls' and women’s bathrooms" as important to them. And 6% said it was the most important issue of all, while 44% said it was "very important."</p><p>Meanwhile, prominent Democratic figures have backpedaled on their party's support for males in women's sports, including Pete Buttigieg, Gavin Newsom and even Kamala Harris. </p><p>In her recent book "107 Days," Harris wrote that she "agrees" with the concerns of parents and athletes who oppose letting males compete with females.</p><p>"I agree with the concerns expressed by parents and players that we have to take into account biological factors such as muscle mass and unfair student athletic advantage when we determine who plays on which teams, especially in contact sports," Harris wrote. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A new list has named the top 10 global world-class airlines, and one small airline made the list for the first time ever, while a boutique Texas carrier also claimed top honors in a separate U.S. ranking.</p><p>The prestigious APEX "World Class" award, presented annually by the Airline Passenger Experience Association, recognizes just 10 airlines worldwide that meet the highest standards of service, safety and passenger satisfaction.</p><p>This year, Fiji Airways, the national carrier of the South Pacific country, landed on the list for the first time, making it the smallest airline by fleet size to ever receive the APEX honor and the first in Oceania to receive it, according to the airline.</p><p>Andre Viljoen, managing director and CEO of Fiji Airways, said in a statement that the recognition, which was announced Sept. 11, "is a proud and historic moment for the airline and for Fiji."</p><p>"In 2016, we were ranked outside the world's Top 100 airlines," Viljoen said. "Today, through sheer grit, relentless innovation and the unbreakable spirit of our people, we have risen to be named one of the Top 10 Airlines in the world.</p><p>"This recognition is not just an award. It's about showing every Fijian, and every member of our team, that we can achieve the impossible."</p><p>Fiji Airways undertook a massive overhaul of its in-flight experience, upgrading equipment, building new supply chains, partnering with local businesses and introducing new premium products, the company said in a news release. </p><p>The airline also revamped its dining with Pacific Rim-inspired cuisine, retrained hundreds of cabin crew and created a team of "World Class Trainers" to ensure service met global standards.</p><p>Founded in 1951 and known as Air Pacific until 2012, Fiji Airways now flies to several cities in the United States, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas and Honolulu.</p><p>The other airlines honored on APEX's "World Class" list this year, in no particular order, are All Nippon Airways, Emirates, Japan Airlines, Oman Air, Qatar Airways, Saudia, Singapore Airlines, Turkish Airlines and Xiamen Airlines.</p><p>Japan Airlines was honored specifically for safety and well-being. Saudia was honored for service-guest experience, and Turkish Airlines won "Best in Class: Sustainability and Food &amp; Beverage Execution."</p><p>"Achieving this higher standard reflects dedication not only to outstanding service and comfort but to safety, sustainability and customer satisfaction that resonate with travelers today," APEX CEO Joe Leader said in a statement.</p><p>"This distinction marks a significant stride toward a future where every flight should be benchmarked against a higher standard of world-class quality," he added.</p><p>APEX evaluates each airline through professional audits, yearlong customer reviews and expert peer assessments, according to the company.</p><p>"Smaller and regional carriers are starting to challenge the big players by focusing on niche excellence, better service, cultural authenticity and a sense of place that the mega-airlines can’t always replicate," said Francis Hellyer, co-founder and CEO of Tickadoo, an AI-powered service that helps people discover and book experiences in major cities.</p><p>"The trend to watch is boutique excellence," Hellyer told Fox News Digital. "Airlines like Fiji show that you can stand alongside the giants if you focus on service, identity and consistency."</p><p>And that trend isn’t limited to international airlines.</p><p>Travel + Leisure magazine released its 2025 World's Best Awards survey of U.S. domestic airlines in July, and readers chose JSX, a Houston-based boutique public charter carrier that offers private jet–style service around the country. It was the second year in a row JSX topped the list.</p><p>Readers praised it for speedy, 20-minute check-ins and free Wi-Fi. It outscored its closest competitor by more than 12 points, according to the outlet.</p><p>Flying JSX is "almost like flying private," one Travel + Leisure reader said. "Friendly staff, easy check-in, help with boarding, luggage."</p><p>The list, which highlights airlines for timeliness, safety, customer service and amenities, also included Hawaiian Airlines, Breeze Airways, Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines in the top five. Delta was the only major "big four" carrier to rank that high.</p><p>Rounding out the top 10 were JetBlue, Southwest, United, American and Sun Country, reflecting a mix of legacy airlines and newer low-cost carriers.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New Jersey GOP gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli called out his opponent, U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., during a town hall Saturday, branding her as out of step with the Garden State on immigration, policing, taxes and ethics.</p><p>"She wants you to believe she’s a Jersey girl. She’s not. She wants you to believe she’s a centrist. She’s not," Ciattarelli told voters.</p><p>The remarks preview Ciattarelli’s closing argument in a tight race for the state's top post as he seeks to define Sherrill by tying her to national Democrats and controversies over immigration enforcement, policing and left-wing allies. Both campaigns have been asked for comment.</p><p>Ciattarelli charged that Sherrill "supported Joe Biden’s open border policies" and "voted no on the Laken Riley Act." Sherrill missed the Riley Act vote earlier this year but later said she would have voted no, arguing the measure was overly broad.</p><p>He also accused her of backing policies on transgender athletes, saying "this mother of two daughters voted yes twice to allow biological boys to play in girls sports." Sherrill voted against GOP bills in 2023 and 2025 that would have banned transgender students from competing based on gender identity.</p><p>On immigration enforcement and policing, Ciattarelli said Sherrill "supports sanctuary cities" and "voted anti-police … looking to get rid of qualified immunity." Sherrill has spoken favorably of New Jersey’s 2018 "Immigrant Trust Directive" and supported the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which sought to curtail qualified immunity and policy police unions opposed.</p><p>He also attacked the congresswoman's opposition to the GOP’s 2025 "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which raised the SALT deduction cap to $40,000, expanded child credits and eliminated federal taxes on overtime and tips. Sherrill and all House Democrats voted no on the package.</p><p>Ethics featured prominently in Ciattarelli’s critique. He reminded voters Sherrill paid a fine under the STOCK Act after disclosing stock trades late and noted her household traded shares in defense companies while she sat on the House Armed Services Committee, though she divested individual holdings in 2019. </p><p>He also covered recent reports that Sherrill was disciplined in the 1994 Naval Academy cheating scandal for failing to report classmates, which barred her from walking at graduation even though she was commissioned.</p><p>Beyond the policy contrasts, Ciattarelli sought to cast Sherrill as aligned with the left. Reporting shows she welcomed support from Zohran Mamdani, the socialist nominee for New York City mayor, saying she shared his voters’ goal of "throwing out the old playbook." </p><p>Republicans labeled the embrace "disqualifying" and warned New Jerseyans could not afford such politics.</p><p>He also pointed to her remarks after the House voted to honor conservative activist Charlie Kirk following his assassination. Sherrill said Kirk had "advocated for a Christian nationalist government and to roll back the rights of women and Black people," while adding that the Constitution protects free speech "even for those I vehemently oppose." Sherrill voted for the resolution.</p><p>Throughout his remarks, Ciattarelli framed Sherrill as left-wing despite her record of caucusing with moderates. Sherrill once belonged to the centrist Blue Dog Coalition and is now a member of the New Democrat Coalition. </p><p>Ciattarelli, by contrast, leaned into his local roots, calling himself the "Jersey guy" and stressing that his family has lived and run businesses in the state for a century. </p><p>"How about we elect the Jersey guy? Ciattarellis have been here for a hundred years … always will be," he said.</p><p>Sherrill, a Navy helicopter pilot and Virginia native, was first elected in 2018 and has lived in Montclair with her family since 2010.</p><p>Ciattarelli, a CPA and former assemblyman, was the GOP nominee for governor in 2021. Polls suggest their 2025 rematch is close.</p><p>Ciattarelli’s attacks showcase his strategy of portraying Sherrill as tied to national Democrats and ethically compromised while presenting himself as a homegrown alternative. </p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to both campaigns for comment on Ciattarelli’s remarks and Sherrill’s past statements.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Lt. Col. George Hardy, one of the last surviving members of the famed Tuskegee Airmen, has died at age 100.</p><p>Hardy served in World War II as part of the unit of America's first Black military pilots. At age 19, he became the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot to fly his first combat sortie over Europe, according to the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. National Office.</p><p>"His legacy is one of courage, resilience, tremendous skill and dogged perseverance against racism, prejudice and other evils," the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. national office said in a statement Friday. "We are forever grateful for his sacrifice and will hold dear to his memory."</p><p>Stationed at Ramitelli Air Field in Italy during WWII, Hardy completed 21 missions over Germany and occupied Europe in P-51 Mustang aircraft. His death leaves only 13 documented original Tuskegee Airmen alive today, the organization noted.</p><p>Hardy, who was born in Philadelphia in 1925 and was the second of seven children, was upstairs doing homework Dec. 7, 1941, when he was interrupted with news of the Pearl Harbor attack, according to the National WWII Museum.</p><p>In 1944, he entered the U.S. Army Air Forces, trained at Tuskegee Army Air Field and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. By early 1945, Hardy deployed to Italy with the African American 99th Fighter Squadron, 332nd Fighter Group, the National WWII Museum noted.</p><p>Hardy’s service extended beyond World War II. He flew 45 missions in the Korean War and 70 in the Vietnam War. </p><p>He later earned degrees at the Air Force Institute of Technology and helped develop the Department of Defense's first global military telephone system before retiring as a lieutenant colonel in 1971, according to the National WWII Museum.</p><p>Following his retirement, Hardy became an advocate for keeping the Tuskegee Airmen’s story alive, speaking to students nationwide. The Tuskegee Airmen received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007 and, in 2024, the National WWII Museum’s American Spirit Award. </p><p>"When I think about the fellas who flew before me and with me at Tuskegee and the fact that we did prove that we could do anything that anyone else could do, and it’s paid off today ... it’s hard to believe that I’m here receiving this award — with them," Hardy said when accepting the American Spirit Award on behalf of the Tuskegee Airmen.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov used his address to the United Nations General Assembly (UGNA) Saturday to deliver one of Moscow’s starkest warnings yet to the West, accusing NATO and the European Union of waging a "real war" against Russia.</p><p>Lavrov opened with sweeping historical references to World War II, positioning Russia as the heir to the Soviet Union’s role in defeating Nazism and defending global sovereignty. He accused the U.S. of dismantling those postwar principles through interventions in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya and warned that the same was happening today in the Middle East. </p><p>While condemning Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, Lavrov said Israel’s campaign in Gaza amounted to "collective punishment" of civilians, linking the conflict to what he portrayed as decades of unchecked Western use of force.</p><p>Lavrov accused NATO of ignoring decades of security commitments. He insisted Russia has "never had and does not have" plans to attack NATO countries, calling Western warnings of a Russian offensive "provocations." </p><p>He singled out claims by European leaders as "false portrayals" of Moscow’s intentions, echoing President Vladimir Putin’s denials that Russia plans to strike NATO or EU territory. </p><p>At the same time, Lavrov issued a direct threat, saying, "Any aggression against my country will be met with a decisive response. There should be no doubt about this among those in NATO and the EU."</p><p>The warning comes amid heightened tension along NATO’s eastern flank. Estonia recently accused Russian jets of violating its airspace, and NATO forces shot down drones over Poland. The U.S. responded by telling the U.N. Security Council it would "defend every inch of NATO territory." Against this backdrop, Lavrov’s speech underscored Moscow’s effort to frame any clash with NATO as an existential threat to Russia itself.</p><p>The timing also intersects with a shift in U.S. rhetoric. President Donald Trump, who met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this week, has hardened his tone on the war, telling reporters that Ukraine <i>can</i> and <i>should</i> reclaim all its territory.</p><p>That marks a departure from earlier signals of openness to negotiation, more than a month after U.S. and Russian officials held rare talks in Alaska. Lavrov’s UN address seemed calibrated to counter Trump’s new line, reminding Washington that Moscow sees the war not as a distant conflict but as a direct confrontation involving the United States.</p><p>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, in his own address to the General Assembly, warned that failing to stop Russia now would unleash "the most destructive arms race ever."</p><p>Lavrov reinforced his message at a press conference after the speech, responding to a question about Western calls to shoot down Russian aircraft that might violate European airspace. He dismissed Trump’s earlier remark that Russia was a "paper tiger," noting that the president had already walked it back. </p><p>He then issued a stark warning: "If there are attempts to down any flying object … over our territory, in our airspace, then I think people will very much regret it, undertaking such an egregious violation of our territorial integrity and sovereignty."</p><p>Lavrov also took aim at U.S. sanctions on Iran, blasting Western efforts to restore or tighten restrictions as "illegal" and evidence of what he described as Washington’s strategy of "blackmail and pressure." </p><p>He said the West had sabotaged diplomatic options to revive the 2015 nuclear deal and rejected what he called manipulations at the U.N. Security Council to isolate Tehran.</p><p>Beyond Europe, Lavrov portrayed Russia as aligned with a rising "global majority" against Western dominance, pointing to BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and African and Latin American calls for greater representation at the U.N. Security Council. </p><p>He accused Washington of using sanctions and military blocs to preserve hegemony, while claiming Russia was defending sovereignty for nations across the Global South.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Timing, they say, is everything, and it is not director Paul Thomas Anderson’s fault that his latest film, "One Battle After Another<i>,"</i> is opening after the worst two weeks of American left-wing political violence in decades. But it sure makes it hard to watch.</p><p>Imagine a movie about World War II in which you are meant to be cheering for lovable Nazis.</p><p>The film is an adaptation of the 1990s novel "Vineland<i>,"</i> and it turns out making Thomas Pynchon novels into movies is a bit like translating James Joyce’s "Ulysses" into Chinese. You can do it, but you miss a lot.</p><p>What is missing here is even the slightest bit of nuance about the glorious necessity to kill people, including innocents, in order to topple Anderson’s weird and paranoid version of the American government.</p><p>At the top, Leonardo DiCaprio’s Bob Ferguson, or Rocketman character, is in a star-crossed love affair with Perfidia Beverly Hills, played by Teyana Taylor. When they aren’t blowing up immigration detention facilities — yes, you read that right — they find time to create a daughter.</p><p>Things go south when Perfidia murders an unarmed guard in cold blood during a bank heist while her partner yells about Black power. The killing disrupts their little family and sends Bob and daughter Willa into hiding as Perfidia runs off, presumably to Cuba.</p><p>The rest of the movie is spent with Sean Penn’s racist and sexually strange Army Col. Steven Lockjaw, who is auditioning for a secretive and elite white supremacist group called the Christmas Adventurers. They presumably have massive political power and spend their time chasing the father and daughter.</p><p>It’s not clear who this racist group is; it’s not even clear if the United States still exists. All we really know is that, aside from DiCaprio, pretty much all the white men in the movie are super-duper villains.</p><p>Lockjaw and his band of racists are just pure evil. There is nothing redeeming about them, and they clearly represent the American government or some version of it, because nobody ever stops Lockjaw from doing wildly illegal things.</p><p>Probably the strangest choice Anderson makes is to shift the time period of the story. In the original, the protagonists are 1960s radicals and the action takes place in 1984. That tracked. This does not.</p><p>"One Battle" starts with a mass political violence campaign from Perfidia’s group, called French 75, in about 2010, with the rest of the movie taking place in the present day. The idea that the federal government was engaged in racist fascism in Obama’s first term just feels absurd.</p><p>For this movie to make any sense at all, one has to believe the United States, today, right now, is a fascist dictatorship. That is not only a dangerous fallacy but, as we have found out recently, a deadly one.</p><p>It is also dangerous to celebrate murderers. Another eerie coincidence is that the film was released the same week exiled far-left cop killer Assata Shakur died in Cuba. The Chicago Teachers Union took to X to honor "the life and legacy of a revolutionary fighter." So the people who teach our kids, just like Anderson, it would seem, think killing cops is fine, as long as it is for the left.</p><p>Growing up in Philadelphia, the name Mumia Abu-Jamal, who sits on death row for killing a cop in the 1980s, was famous, as it is around the global left, where he is celebrated as some kind of hero.</p><p>But in the little Irish bars from Northeast Philly to the Italian Market, you will often see an old, dim photo of a man in a police hat and light blues. His name was Officer Daniel Faulkner, the man Abu-Jamal killed, a man who never became famous outside of our hearts.</p><p>As I walked to my car after the nearly three-hour indictment of America, I lit a cigarette and wondered how all these multimillionaires like DiCaprio and Anderson can live with themselves if they truly believe America is as rank and horrible as the film depicts.</p><p>How can all those actors at the Emmy Awards who yell "F--- ICE!" like ignorant toddlers reconcile that the same government is what protects their fabulous lifestyles of the rich and famous?</p><p>Anderson won’t be committing any "brave" acts of murder to right the supposed wrongs of our nation. He’ll just make movies encouraging others to do so while he basks in the fruits of capitalism.</p><p>The whole movie made me a little angry, but then I remembered that the Trump administration is cracking down on Antifa — today’s very real domestic terrorists — and maybe this will be a fun movie for them to watch once they are all in jail.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Atlantic published an article criticizing Democrats for talking a big game about moderating their positions to win back the public, while failing to actually do so out of fear of their base.</p><p>While some rising Democratic leaders have called out the party as being too "weak and woke" and urged them to "retake the flag" after their historic loss in November, other commentators have challenged Democrats to specify which progressive cultural policies they will actually leave behind, knowing it might enrage their base.</p><p>The Atlantic’s assistant editor, Marc Novicoff, was the latest to weigh in, publishing a piece headlined "Democrats Don’t Seem Willing to Follow Their Own Advice." He asked, "Party leaders know they need to moderate on cultural issues to win back working-class voters — so why don’t they?" </p><p>The piece argued that, with a few exceptions, Democrats have avoided disavowing specific far-left policies, "whether regarding trans athletes or other high-profile social issues on which the party is vulnerable, such as immigration and climate."</p><p>One example Novicoff cited was Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., who said the political pendulum had swung too far leftward. Yet, "Even Torres’s big postelection immigration ‘flip-flop,’ as Politico put it, was to announce that he would no longer fight against the deportation of undocumented immigrants who have a criminal record."</p><p>Novicoff also highlighted another example of a Democrats offering symbolic policies that extend an olive branch to conservatives without alienating liberals, noting this was a "leading example" of moderation cited by The Washington Post.</p><p>He pointed to Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who boasted that he had legalized hunting on Sundays. </p><p>"No core constituency in the Democratic Party is outraged by the thought of hunting on Sundays, which is why you almost certainly heard nothing about Shapiro’s comment," Novicoff wrote.</p><p>Novicoff argued that the gold standard of actual moderation was former President Bill Clinton’s "Sister Souljah" moment in 1992, referencing when Clinton denounced the rapper's remarks about race while he was running for president, infuriating many far-left activists.</p><p>Elaine Kamarck, who worked in the Clinton White House, told The Atlantic that sometimes "you’ve got to go against your party," and "if nobody gets mad, you’re not doing anything courageous."</p><p>Even Trump, Novicoff argued, deserves some credit for using moderate messaging to win support. </p><p>"Trump is no moderate, but in 2016 and 2024, he used selective moderation to make inroads with swing voters who disapprove of certain unpopular Republican Party orthodoxies," the writer suggested. "In his first run for president, he committed to not cutting Social Security and Medicare, and he hammered his primary opponents for supporting the invasion of Iraq. </p><p>"In his 2024 run, he promised not to enact a national abortion ban. All three of these positions were broadly popular but offended core Republican constituencies — budget hawks, neoconservatives, and pro-lifers, respectively. They seem to have paid off."</p><p>But Democrats seem to have reason to fear their base if they attempt moderation. Novicoff recalled Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who angered progressives by opposing biological men competing in women’s sports. The Atlantic reported that Moulton quickly faced protesters at his district office, was branded a "Nazi cooperator" and drew a primary challenge from a transgender opponent. </p><p>Moulton asserted to The Atlantic that "fear of backlash" is what is holding many of his fellow Democrats back from changing their stances publicly.</p><p>Novicoff suggested that a key reason is that many Democrats hold safe seats, where their biggest threat is a primary challenge from the left. But, at the national level, he argued, refusing to moderate is a losing strategy.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Rep. Torres and Gov. Shapiro but did not receive an immediate response.</p></body></div></body></html>
