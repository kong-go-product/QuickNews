                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A North Carolina state representative is under fire for saying there is "no correlation" between the murder of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old refugee from Ukraine, and the fact that her accused killer had been released from jail 14 times.</p><p>State Rep. Marcia Morey, a longtime Democratic lawmaker and former judge, made the comments while defending the state’s bail system. Critics argue the system has allowed violent offenders to cycle in and out of custody with little accountability.</p><p>Decarlos Brown has been described by authorities as a dangerous career criminal who was repeatedly in and out of jail before he allegedly stabbed Zarutska to death on a light rail train in Charlotte. Many believe a broken bail system allowed him to remain free despite his violent record.</p><p>Morey, one of North Carolina’s most vocal advocates for bail reform, defended her comments and went on to condemn efforts to connect the case to bail policies.</p><p>"But don’t correlate what happened in January and a magistrate who set a bail according to guidelines to what happened in August. There is no correlation," she said during a legislative session.</p><p>Her argument has been countered by many lawmakers, who claim the tragedy shows exactly why it’s dangerous to allow repeat offenders back on the street.</p><p>Republican Senate Leader Phil Berger argued that bail reform measures designed to keep more defendants out of jail while awaiting trial are endangering public safety.</p><p>"Iryna should still be alive. She should be thriving and enjoying time with her family and friends," Berger said. "We cannot let North Carolina be held hostage by woke, weak-on-crime policies and court officials who prioritize criminals over justice for victims. We are also taking steps to revive the death penalty for those who commit the most heinous crimes."</p><p>However, supporters of bail reform argue the system unfairly punishes low-income defendants who cannot afford release.</p><p>Families of victims like Zarutska, on the other hand, believe the consequences are deadly when repeat offenders are given chance after chance.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The media continue to bend over backward to avoid the overtly political nature of the murders of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson — while President Donald Trump has taken the step of "designating" Antifa as a terrorist organization.  </p><p>So, with political violence on the rise — undeniably from the left — will we finally see federal terrorism charges against domestic actors committing political violence on the home front? Will the likes of Tyler Robinson and Luigi Mangione now face federal terrorism charges?  </p><p>Alas, as the law is currently constructed, we will not.  </p><p>That should change. Not by simply "designating" domestic groups as terrorists; that actually won’t change anything when it comes to charging "domestic terrorism." </p><p>No, there’s a simpler, less politically charged means available. And the blueprint is already proven.  </p><p>Some background: The way the federal law is structured now, only foreign groups can be designated as "terrorists." The fear among legislators has been — and remains — that the ability to designate a domestic group as "terrorists" could be used as a cudgel by both sides of the political aisle.   </p><p>As a result, federal prosecutors twist themselves into pretzels to charge violent acts committed by politically inspired actors on the home front. Mangione’s federal murder prosecution, for instance, rests on the foundation of a weak stalking statute; as of this writing, any federal case against Robinson would likely look similar. </p><p>But is the process of "designation" — the pre-labeling of a group by the executive branch — actually necessary? Would it not be preferable to leave to the court process the decision as to whether violence committed for ideological purposes qualifies as "terrorism"?   </p><p>The model for how to do this exists already in the federal hate crime regime. Simply put, there are violent acts that qualify as "crimes-of-hate" if they are inspired by animus against certain groups on the basis of race, religion, etc.  </p><p>Whether you agree with hate crime statutes or not, they have survived legal scrutiny. So why not apply the same model to terrorism? </p><p>Here’s how it would go. First, there would be a list of various serious crimes that qualify. These would be either violent felony-level acts or the support or funding of such acts.  </p><p>Then, when charging that crime, the prosecutor would have to allege, and then prove, the perpetrator’s intention to influence government policy or coerce the civilian population (the federal definition of what constitutes "terrorism").  </p><p>And that’s it.  </p><p>In light of Robinson and Mangione, let’s use murder as an example. If the prosecutor can demonstrate that a murder has been committed with this requisite terroristic intent, the crime would then be charged as "murder as a crime of terrorism."  </p><p>Typically, the prosecutor would charge both regular "murder" and, also, the "murder as a crime of terrorism." If the judge decides there is not enough evidence for the "terrorism" charge, he can knock it out right at the beginning of the trial process.  </p><p>If the charge survives the judge, the prosecutor has to then prove the whole shebang to a jury — not just the murder charge, but also the terroristic intent behind the killing.  </p><p>This, in fact, is how New York’s state terrorism laws are structured — and it works. A state judge, in fact, just knocked out the terrorism piece in the Mangione case, but the regular murder charge survives. </p><p>So, why bother? If we can backdoor our way to at least some federal charges in many instances of political violence anyway, do we really need a new regime that invokes the "t" word?  </p><p>We do. As a society, we recognize that ideological murder is a crime against more than simply the individual victim. It also impacts society writ large, and cuts to the heart of our shared social contract.  </p><p>As such, these crimes should qualify for enhanced sentencing parameters, while, at the same time, taking politics out of the mix by letting a judge and jury control the process.  </p><p>Is there still potential for politicization here? Sure. But there always is in the criminal justice system. To pretend otherwise is foolhardy.  </p><p>But what is also foolhardy is witnessing events like the murders of Charlie Kirk and Brian Thompson — and pretending they were not committed for political purposes. </p><p>It’s past time to stop lying to ourselves. We have a domestic terrorism problem — and yes, despite the Biden administration’s endless invocations of "White supremacy," it is coming almost exclusively today from elements of an aggrieved, enraged left. </p><p>It’s time to charge it so. </p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>China recently rejected President Donald Trump’s offer to discuss nuclear arms reductions. Then, shortly after, Beijing revealed new weapons in its World War II parade, a celebratory affair that Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un also enjoyed. </p><p>The parade included a variety of cutting-edge technologies, but the nuclear delivery systems stood out. The Chinese military showcased a full triad of improved capabilities: silo-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, an air-launched ballistic missile and a submarine-launched ballistic missile.</p><p>Just three years ago, China denied it was rapidly building up its nuclear arsenal. In 2022, Fu Cong, then the director-general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s arms control department (now China's permanent representative to the United Nations), told reporters that China was maintaining only a minimum deterrent necessary to defend itself. </p><p>Minimum deterrence is a strategy based on the assumption that a nation needs only to possess enough nuclear weapons to survive a first strike and credibly threaten a retaliatory strike sufficiently destructive in the mind of its adversary that the original act of aggression is deterred. Although the exact numbers that would meet those criteria are difficult to discern, the size of the force is modest.</p><p>China also continues to insist that it holds a no-first-use policy. This means it would not use a nuclear weapon against a nation first, but only in response to an attack. In theory, this policy would complement its alleged minimum deterrent strategy, but its nuclear investments belie both claims.</p><p>Four years ago, then Stratcom Commander Adm. Charles Richard publicly warned that it is more useful to watch what the Chinese are doing than what they were claiming. China was amid what he called a "strategic breakout." The military exercises between China and Russia were becoming more frequent, too, making what he described as "breathtaking" expansion even more alarming. </p><p>The Chinese were quickly expanding the size of their nuclear force and investing in diverse systems, and they were on a trajectory that suggested a challenge to the U.S. deterrent force, which is only designed to deter one major nuclear power, not two simultaneously. </p><p>Because of this, Adm. Richard concluded that, while it was impossible to know exactly how Xi Jinping might think about the purpose of the nuclear force, "what matters is they are building the capability to execute any plausible nuclear employment strategy – the last brick in the wall of a military capable of coercion."</p><p>Any successful act of coercion relies on a nation’s adversary believing that it has the capability and willingness to attack. And Beijing is working on a force to convince Washington of that. Not only is China building a large and diverse nuclear arsenal that can reach U.S. ships, bases and allies, it is mixing its nuclear and conventional weapons on dual-capable systems. And China’s strategic nuclear breakout is leading up to the time when U.S. officials have assessed China may try to take Taiwan by force (2027).</p><p>A 2024 annual Department of Defense report to Congress described China’s nuclear force as including "low-yield precision strike missiles to ICBMs with multi-megaton yields to provide it options at every rung of the escalation ladder." </p><p>That same report also said, "DoD estimates that the PRC will have over 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030, much of which will be deployed at higher readiness levels, and will continue growing its force to 2035 in line with its goal of ensuring [People’s Liberation Army] modernization is ‘basically complete’ that year, an important milestone on the road to Xi’s goal of a ‘world class’ military by 2049."</p><p>The report also noted that China will probably use its new fast breeder reactors and reprocessing facilities to produce plutonium for its nuclear weapons. Just like when China said it was keeping a minimum deterrent and a no-first-use policy, it was lying about this. Chinese officials claimed that these technologies are for peaceful purposes.</p><p>After China’s recent parade, I asked retired Adm. Richard what he made of it. He told me, "I think it's important to look at it in totality. They are advancing rapidly in all aspects necessary for a military designed for aggression." The new information, all publicly available, shows that the admiral was right when he sounded the alarm several years ago.</p><p>And while the nuclear expert community has found a consensus on the need to quickly modernize and adapt the U.S. nuclear force to deter Chinese aggression, decision-makers in the Pentagon have not fully grappled with this change. For example, the Biden administration did not make sufficient changes to field a nuclear deterrent force that could deter China and Russia simultaneously.</p><p>To preserve the peace, the Trump administration should do the following:</p><p>One, fully modernize the program of record by replacing its nuclear delivery systems; modernizing its warheads as well as U.S. nuclear command, control, and communications; and recapitalizing the nuclear enterprise infrastructure. </p><p>The total cost of this is disputed, but the upper range of the estimates is roughly 7% of the national defense budget, whose entire budget is less than 4% of the nation’s gross domestic product. To prevent nuclear war and preserve the peace, this is more than a bargain.</p><p>Two, formally terminate the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) with Russia, which expires in February 2026. Russia announced during its invasion of Ukraine that it would no longer abide by the treaty’s accounting requirements.</p><p>If the United States decides to stay within the confines of New START—when there is no way to determine if Russia is doing the same, and when China is completely unrestrained by a treaty – then Washington would be unilaterally restrained when it desperately needs to adapt its force to deter the growing Chinese arsenal.</p><p>President Trump understood the foolishness of remaining bound by the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty during his first term when Russia was cheating on it and formally withdrew from it. The same logic applies to New START today.</p><p>Three, bolster theater nuclear deterrence in the Pacific by speeding up the delivery of the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile (SLCM-N), a program President Trump initiated during his first term. The first Trump administration explained that it was adding this "prudent" option to enhance "the flexibility and diversity of U.S. nuclear capabilities… by signaling to potential adversaries that their limited nuclear escalation offers no exploitable advantage." </p><p>The Biden administration did not support President Trump’s initiative until the end of its term, losing significant time. Now President Trump has the ability to speed up efforts to deliver this critical capability in time to deter Chinese aggression. </p><p>Additionally, the next generation bomber, the B-21, will be instrumental for deterring China and assuring allies. And as its older cousin, the B-2, showed off against the illicit Iranian nuclear program in Operation Midnight Hammer, stealth bombers are a threat to the most deeply buried targets inside enemy territory. </p><p>The Air Force plans to produce 100 B-21s, but adding a second production line and doubling the production output would be wise. This would also bring down the cost per item while delivering a powerful deterrent that the president can use across geographic theaters.</p><p>China claims that it has a minimum deterrent, follows a no-first-use policy and uses nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. None of that is true. For the sake of peace, the United States should boost the credibility of its nuclear deterrence accordingly – and fast.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> – Georgetown University students who spoke to Fox News Digital said they were afraid and disappointed when they saw flyers posted on campus Wednesday by a far-left group that approvingly referenced the killer of Charlie Kirk.</p><p>"My first emotion was fear," Jordan Van Slingerland, a senior international politics major, said on Thursday. "What happened to Charlie Kirk hit myself and, of course, many of my friends on this campus very hard, and seeing the text that was on the bullet of the assassin that had taken his life, certainly, was a bit scary."</p><p>While one student told Fox News Digital that the flyers were only posted for about 30 minutes on Wednesday before they were taken down, several more flyers were posted on campus the following night, including a photo of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated three weeks ago, with the slogans: "Follow your leader" and "Rest in p-ss Charlie." Video obtained by Fox News Digital showed a Georgetown University police officer removing the flyers Thursday. </p><p>"It made me feel very upset," Elizabeth Oliver, a Georgetown senior and president of the university's "Right to Life" group, told Fox News Digital in an interview. "Over the years, I've heard many hateful things against conservatives, and this was so blatant and in people's faces that it made me very worried for my other friends who share my similar beliefs."</p><p>The flyer was posted by the John Brown Gun Club, whom the Center for Counter Extremism has labeled a "far-left group." They contained the phrase, "Hey fascist! Catch!" – an apparent nod to the slogan authorities say was etched in a shell casing found near the bolt-action rifle allegedly used to assassinate Kirk at Utah Valley University.</p><p>The group is named for militant slave abolitionist John Brown and the flyer also referred to their organization as "the only political group that celebrates when Nazis die" on the flyers. </p><p>Matthew Cosenza, a Georgetown freshman, said the flyer caught his eye when it went viral on X on Wednesday. </p><p>"I really wasn't that surprised to see material like that on campus," Cosenza said. "I've seen other material that likens Trump to Hitler, the conservatives to fascists and the conservative movement on campus to Nazism."</p><p>Senior Rowan O'Sullivan also was not surprised.</p><p>"Certainly, it's out-of-control," O'Sullivan said. "But I think it's pretty obvious that whatever version of leftism, whatever you want to call this is, I think is, to some degree, window dressing for bloodlust at the end of it, and you saw that with the reactions to Charlie Kirk's death."</p><p>As the director of Campus Affairs for Georgetown's College Republicans chapter and a board member for conservative groups on campus, Van Slingerland said he has been threatened with political violence since President Donald Trump was elected. </p><p>"The climate has certainly been very hostile here for conservative students since then," Van Slingerland said. </p><p>After Shae McInnis, a sophomore at Georgetown University and treasurer of the school's College Republicans club, spoke to Fox News Digital, O'Sullivan said he "has been identified by these left-wing groups on anonymous campus messaging platforms," and students "have been spreading lies and fabrications about him."</p><p>"I've heard from many people that they don't want to get involved in groups like debate societies," Oliver said. "This anonymous attacking from people, where you don't know where it's coming from, is very scary. So many people are deterred from even sharing their beliefs in classrooms."</p><p>Georgetown released a statement on Thursday affirming the campus has "no tolerance for calls for violence or threats to the university."</p><p>"The flyers have been removed, and the university is investigating this incident and working to ensure the safety of our community," Georgetown University said. </p><p>But students said the administration could do more to deter this type of violent rhetoric. </p><p>"I would love to see the university distinguish itself from other elite universities in the United States, which have all completely succumbed to leftism and have rotted from the inside out," O'Sullivan said. </p><p>While defending the right to free speech, O'Sullivan argued that Georgetown is a private institution, and "if the school had any spine, they would absolutely condemn it and come down hard, and not just send us an email."</p><p>Two students who spoke to Fox News Digital said they were concerned the Trump administration would cut their federal funding in response to the flyer. </p><p>Cash Moore, a Georgetown sophomore and a member of the College Democrats club, said that when he first saw the poster in a group chat, he felt "disappointment" that some students view violence as acceptable.</p><p>"The first thing I thought was a little disappointment that some people, perhaps on this campus, hold that violence is something that is productive in society," Moore said.</p><p>However, he said he is concerned that the Trump administration’s attention to the flyer could put a "target" on the university."</p><p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon posted a statement on Wednesday condemning the "appalling posters" and urging the university to "determine what it stands for as an institution."</p><p>"ED officials have spoken to Georgetown administrators, who made the decision to remove the flyers. Campus police are investigating the incident and will deploy resources to protect students as necessary. Allowing violent rhetoric to fester on our nation’s campuses without consequences is dangerous. It must be condemned by institutional leaders," McMahon said. </p><p>"I think one of the things I am worried about is, is Trump going to target us next?" Moore asked. </p><p>When reached for comment regarding the students' fears of retaliation, White House spokesperson Liz Huston told Fox News Digital, "This despicable act at Georgetown underscores just how mainstream political violence has become on the left and why Charlie Kirk’s work on college campuses was so important."</p><p>"Through debate, Charlie taught students how to think critically and engage across differences. Americans should continue to live by the same principles as Charlie – speaking the truth, fostering real dialogue, and loving your country," the White House added. </p><p>Referencing Trump's speech at Kirk's memorial on Sunday when he said, "I hate my opponents," Moore told Fox News Digital that it's "valid for the left to also feel afraid."</p><p>Moore said he has only seen the left take steps to condemn the violence and that "a lot of the escalation is coming from the right, not just a few crazy people putting up posters on the left."</p><p>"We do have a free speech right on this campus, and I think that’s something a lot of us value and, obviously, a call to violence isn’t something that should take place, but there also is that free speech aspect that's important to acknowledge," he said.</p><p>Max Wolff-Merovick, a sophomore and a member of the school’s largest debating society, said he believes the flyers were put up by "a small group of students" in an attempt to spark outrage rather than to promote a student club.</p><p>"It’s unequivocally bad to be emulating the rhetoric of a political assassin," Wolff-Merovick said. "That’s not something that anyone should be doing. But it also struck me as something that was more intended to provoke outrage on purpose rather than a serious attempt at creating a student organization as it's been characterized by a number of different people."</p><p>Wolff-Merovick said that "this does not represent the student body" at the school.</p><p>"Certainly I feel for it, but I think, at the same time, we need to be grounded in reality and know that this does not represent the student body at Georgetown as a whole, much less the left in general," he said.</p><p>Wolff-Merovick said both sides "could do a better job at universally calling to turn the temperature down."</p><p>Jonathan Rothschild, a student at Georgetown University, said free speech should remain protected, but political violence "should not be glorified."</p><p>"If it is not a direct call to violence, I think the Georgetown University administration, to protect free speech, should leave it up, even though I personally find it abhorrent," Rothschild said, adding that most students on campus oppose political violence.</p><p>"I think everyone with common sense should be against political violence," he said.</p><p>Georgetown University did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. </p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Peter D'Abrosca contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>: After a fatal anti-ICE shooting in Dallas this week, a special federal agent working on deportations revealed that their "biggest fear" is that they will be left stranded by sanctuary jurisdictions in the face of third-party rioters "who have been riled up to believe that I'm kidnapping somebody."</p><p>In an interview with Fox News Digital, the agent, who works in New England, said that interference from protesters who have been radicalized by Democrats’ anti-ICE rhetoric has become a regular occurrence.</p><p>Amid these interferences, the agent said that they receive very little support from local and state law enforcement, whose hands are tied due to Democratic-passed sanctuary policies. The result is an extremely tense situation, which the agent fears could get out of hand at any moment.</p><p>"My biggest fear is third parties who have been riled up to believe that I'm kidnapping somebody, I'm taking away their rights, and I'm destroying somebody's life for no reason, being present when this happens and trying to interfere with what we're doing, because that gets dangerous, it really does," the agent explained.</p><p>"One of our biggest fears," the agent went on, "is, let's say we go and there's 3 or 4 of us, and we stop a guy, and then crowds come out, and the crowds become violent, or they become really aggressive, they impede our jobs."</p><p>According to the Department of Homeland Security, ICE agents are facing a 1,000% increase in assaults.</p><p>The danger is especially acute in sanctuary jurisdictions, the agent said, because there, "local police will not help us all the time."</p><p>"It’s very dependent on where that ICE facility sits, how it's going to be treated," they explained.</p><p>In New England, the agent said that some law enforcement agencies "do not want to help us with anything."</p><p>"They'll have nothing to do with it," the agent said. "That gets very, very stressful."</p><p>Because of this lack of support, the agent said that situations with rioters or protesters are significantly more dangerous.</p><p>"That means it's fight or flight at that time," the agent explained. "They're yelling at me, at the same time, they're attracting the attention of other people, but I'm trying to focus on getting this person handcuffed, processed, interviewing them, determining their alienage while someone's yelling at me or someone's getting in my face … I don't know if they have weapons, I don't know if they're on drugs and they're going to attack me. I don't know all this."</p><p>While some Democrats have vilified ICE agents, accusing them of racially profiling people, using "Gestapo tactics" and "terrorizing" communities, the agent likened their job to an "investigative reporter" working within the confines of U.S. federal law.</p><p>"I prove and disprove allegations; I have tools to do it. I have search warrants. I have grand jury subpoenas, I do interviews, I do surveillance, I do record checks, that's what I do. When you boil everything down in the simplest terms, I'm not trying to do riots," the agent said.</p><p>They shared that when one of their colleagues explained to a protester what ICE agents really do with illegals, she was shocked.</p><p>"He was explaining to her, ‘We're not going to harm this guy.’ She's like, ‘Oh, he's going to disappear,’ and all the stupid talking points, no due process, this and that. And he took the time to explain to her that he's going to get to call his family, he's going to get a call with a lawyer, and he'll see a judge. She was like, ‘Well, I didn't know all that.' This is what they're telling me. That's what we're dealing with."</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-title">I’m a gender detransitioner. I told the FTC how doctors abused their power over me</div>
                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>This summer, I, alongside several fellow detransitioners, spoke to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) about how the medical establishment lied to us as children.   We were told we could become members of the opposite sex if only we took the puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones they prescribed us and underwent surgeries to remove healthy body parts.  </p><p>That was a lie. No one can switch sexes.   </p><p>Our parents were told we would kill ourselves if they didn’t sign on to these medical and surgical regimens. </p><p>That was a lie, too. There is no evidence that transgender-identifying people commit suicide if they are not affirmed, despite activists’ claims to the contrary. </p><p>The FTC’s job is to go after "unfair and deceptive practices" in trade — and what I have experienced from the medical establishment is about as unfair and deceptive as it gets. After hearing stories like mine, the agency is requesting comments from those harmed by gender-affirming care, and I’m calling on all Americans adversely affected by this ideology to join me in telling the FTC their stories. </p><p>I’ll start with mine. </p><p>After all those so-called "treatments" doctors gave me — which would be better described as interference with our bodies’ natural processes — I was left with a long list of medical issues that no woman should have to suffer. </p><p>When I was just 17, doctors put me on testosterone, which is not meant for female bodies in such high doses. The hormone, as a result, caused damage to my healthy endocrine system that persists years after stopping testosterone: I now suffer from vaginal atrophy, sexual dysfunction, chronic pain and a weakened voice that I can no longer use to sing.  </p><p> Additionally, the testosterone made it so my pubescent body was also never allowed to develop properly, leaving my hips smaller than they otherwise would have been, which made pregnancy extremely painful. I was forced to deliver my son via C-section because doctors’ interference with my healthy body made vaginal delivery impossible. </p><p>The medical establishment also thought it acceptable to amputate my healthy breasts, in what I later realized was a botched procedure. When performing a double mastectomy on me, the surgeon cut off my nipples, cut them up to reshape them into a supposedly more "masculine" shape, and sewed them on in the wrong place. Not only did this surgeon take away my choice to breastfeed — as I was recovering from my C-section, the milk I was supposed to be able to feed my son was trapped in my chest, leading to intense pain. </p><p>All of this was done on me despite the fact that doctors knew I was mentally ill, likely suffering from borderline personality disorder and having been diagnosed as a child with anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, suicidal ideations and depression. The idea that putting me through irreversible chemical and surgical changes would make me better is absurd on its face, and, yet, was given a big thumbs up by the medical establishment — which has its own incentives to do so.   </p><p>Indeed, beyond ideology, there is a financial motive here for them. For the rest of my life, I will be forced to pay the same medical establishment that harmed me in order to deal with the side effects that they caused me in the name of "care." Meanwhile, for those doctors and surgeons, my case is a double profit: charge patients for hormones and surgeries and then charge patients again to manage whatever injuries those hormones and surgeries caused. </p><p>This is essentially the gender industry’s business model, one that rakes in cash for hospitals and pharma while destroying our bodies in the process. This cannot be left to stand. While I and other detransitioners may be dependent on the system that caused us great medical harm, no one else should have to go through this.  </p><p>Thankfully, the FTC is standing up for us — and all the Americans who could get trapped by the medical industry as I did. It is deceit when doctors call this butchery "care," and they should not be able to get away with it. </p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Seattle Seahawks held off their NFC West rival, the Arizona Cardinals, in a 23-20 victory on the road on Thursday night.</p><p>The Seahawks improved to 3-1 to start the early season, while the Cardinals fell to 2-2. </p><p>There wasn’t much coming from the Cardinals’ offense in this game, but the fourth quarter made the game very interesting as Kyler Murray finally got some momentum going. </p><p>Marvin Harrison Jr., who was having a rough game at that point, was trusted by Murray on a pass to the end zone, and he hauled it in over Seahawks cornerback Devon Witherspoon to make it a one-score game after the extra point. </p><p>Sam Darnold and the Seahawks, owning a 20-13 lead, knew they could seal victory with a long drive, killing clock and making it a two-score game. It looked like that was coming when Jaxon Smith-Njigba caught a 36-yard pass on third-and-6 to get into Cardinals territory. </p><p>But three plays later, Jason Myers was trying a 53-yard field goal and he missed wide right to keep the Cardinals’ hopes alive. And Murray delivered the drive his team needed to tie it up. </p><p>The Cardinals went 12 plays and 57 yards in just under three minutes, as running back Emari Demercado was wide open on second-and-goal and he ran into the end zone for the tie following the extra point with 28 seconds left to play in regulation. </p><p>There was a slim chance Darnold could get Myers back in his field goal range to try a game-winner, but that all changed when Chad Ryland’s kickoff attempt failed to get into the designated landing zone between the goal line and the 20-yard line. The ball bounced just before the 20-yard line, giving Seattle the ball at their own 40-yard line. </p><p>Darnold got the ball onto Arizona’s side thanks to a perfect pass to Smith-Njigba for a 22-yard gain. After a Zach Charbonnet four-yard run, Myers had another chance from almost the same distance as he lined up a 52-yarder. </p><p>This time, it was true as the Seahawks celebrated their victory in a big divisional matchup. </p><p>As noted, this game wasn’t an offensive thriller as both defenses were playing their opponents well. However, Darnold was able to orchestrate two touchdown drives, finding tight end A.J. Barner from 16 yards out for the team’s first points on the scoreboard, while Charbonnet ran one in at the goal line in the second quarter to head into the locker room with a 14-3 lead. </p><p>Both teams would find a field goal in the third quarter before the fourth turned this game into a thriller. </p><p>Looking at the stat sheet, Darnold was 18-of-26 for 242 yards with his touchdown pass and no interceptions, with Smith-Njigba leading the way with 79 yards on just four catches. Kenneth Walker III may not have found the end zone, but he did lead the rushing attack with 81 yards on 19 carries compared to Charbonnet’s 39 yards on 12 touches in the backfield. </p><p>As for the Cardinals, Murray was 27-of-41 with two touchdown passes and two interceptions thrown, including one that luckily went back to Arizona after Cobe Bryant ran into his own Seahawks teammate and fumbled while returning the pick. Harrison was the leading receiver with 66 yards on six catches. </p><p>Trey Benson, who will be filling in for James Conner the remainder of the season after his year-ending foot injury last week, had 35 yards on just eight carries in his first game as the team’s primary running back. He also had five catches from Murray for 19 yards. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Georgetown University said it removed a second wave of inflammatory posters mocking the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and has reported the incident to the FBI. </p><p>Photos of the flyers at the elite Washington, D.C., university, including one that showed Kirk’s face with his eyes blacked out and the words "Follow your leader" and "Rest in p-ss Charlie," were first obtained by Fox News.</p><p>The posters were taped up Thursday night in Georgetown’s central Red Square, the school’s main free speech zone. They also carried QR codes and the seal of the "Georgetown John Brown Club," a group tied to leftist activism and past violence.</p><p>"Georgetown University has no tolerance for calls for violence or threats to the university," a university spokesperson told Fox News Digital. </p><p>"Upon discovering the new flyers, the university removed them and reported them to the FBI. The university’s team of safety and security experts, including its police department and specialized threat assessment professionals, will continue to investigate this incident and work in partnership with law enforcement to ensure the safety of our community."</p><p>Shae McInnis, treasurer of the Georgetown College Republicans, told Fox News Digital he was taken aback by the flyers' reappearance on campus. </p><p>"Just even more shocked than I was [Wednesday]… it really makes me feel like our entire university is under attack by people with no decency and no respect for our society," he said.</p><p>McInnis said conservative students are now openly questioning whether it is even safe to host events on campus. </p><p>"Should I go out to this event? Should we have a Georgetown College Republicans event? Is that even safe now?" he asked. But, he added, his group refuses to back down: "They’re trying to shut us up, but we’re not going to. We’re going to be bolder, be louder and proclaim our message with confidence."</p><p>U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon condemned the flyers Wednesday, writing on X that violent rhetoric on campus "must be condemned by institutional leaders."</p><p>The first round of posters appeared on Wednesday and used the slogan "Hey fascist! Catch!" </p><p>Accused assassin Tyler Robinson used the same phrase etched onto the shell casing in Charlie Kirk’s Sept. 10 killing at Utah Valley University. Those same flyers also declared, "The only political group that celebrates when Nazis die," alongside a QR code linking to the John Brown Gun Club.</p><p>McInnis said Thursday’s posters marked a clear escalation. </p><p>"[Wednesday] there were fewer posters on a less prominent area of campus. Today, they went to what’s called ‘Red Square,’ the main free speech zone… They went in broad daylight… They’re being even more brash."</p><p>He warned the rhetoric has already chilled free speech on campus. "How can people be safe to express themselves freely if they know their classmates could be wanting to kill them, literally kill them for expressing their own ideas?"</p><p>The John Brown Gun Club, cited in the Georgetown flyers, is classified as a far-left group by the Center for Counter Extremism. It has been linked to violence, including a July 4, 2025, armed attack on an ICE detention center in Texas that left an officer injured, and the 2019 attempted firebombing of an ICE facility in Tacoma, Washington, where attacker Willem van Spronsen was killed.</p><p>McInnis called for swift accountability. </p><p>"The university should identify every student involved, and they must be immediately expelled… If the university is not willing to do that, I would urge the federal government to please help," he said. "Please protect conservative students at Georgetown and across every campus in our country."</p><p>McMahon and the FBI did not immediately return Fox News Digital's additional request for comment Thursday.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Peter D'Abrosca, Kiera McDonald, and Andrew Murray contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Vice President JD Vance said he would "love" Jimmy Kimmel to apologize to Erika Kirk and the people he "slandered" after the late-night host returned to the airwaves Tuesday after a brief suspension.</p><p>Kimmel’s show was pulled from the air after his comments on Charlie Kirk’s death drew backlash from conservatives and Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr, who warned the agency could take regulatory action.</p><p>"He [Kimmel] tries to say that he told a joke. He didn't tell a joke. He was actually accusing right-wing America, conservative America, of killing Charlie Kirk. We now know that is false. Charlie Kirk was murdered by a left-wing assassin who was radicalized by some of the rhetoric that we see coming from the far-Left," Vance said Thursday during an interview on "The Ingraham Angle."</p><p>"When you accuse the people who've been holding prayer vigils, who have been praying about Charlie Kirk, you accuse them of killing Charlie Kirk, when we know as a left-wing assassin, you're actually apologizing for his murder, you're encouraging more of that violence to happen."</p><p>The vice president continued: "If we're going to stop this crazy strain of left-wing violence, we have to be honest about what it is, and the honest truth is that Charlie Kirk was not killed by a MAGA American. He was not killed by a Republican. He was killed by a left-wing radical. Let's be honest about that fact, so that we can stop it from happening."</p><p>Kimmel’s Sept. 15 remarks criticized the Republican response to Kirk’s assassination, accusing the "MAGA gang" of trying to politicize it by portraying the shooter as "anything other than one of them" to score "political points."</p><p>Kirk’s alleged assassin, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, surrendered to police and was charged with aggravated murder, two counts of obstruction of justice, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, among others. </p><p>A family member of Robinson told investigators that he had "become more political in recent years" and disliked Kirk’s views, according to Utah Gov. Spencer Cox.</p><p>"Clearly there was a lot of gaming going on — friends that have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet, the Reddit culture, and these other dark places of the internet where this person was going deep," Cox told NBC’s "Meet the Press."</p><p>Kimmel’s first monologue since his return has drawn more than 21 million views on YouTube as of Thursday evening, and averaged 6.2 million viewers, according to The New York Times.</p><p>His show is still being preempted by Nexstar Media and Sinclair, which own ABC-affiliated television stations. </p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Trump reacted to the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, telling Fox News Digital during an exclusive interview that he "placed a cloud over the entire nation" with the bureau’s "Crossfire Hurricane" probe.</p><p>Comey, on Thursday evening, was indicted by a grand jury on two counts, alleged false statements within jurisdiction of the legislative branch and obstruction of congressional proceeding.</p><p>"What they did was so terrible and so corrupt," Trump told Fox News Digital, referring to those involved in the Trump-Russia probe. "We had a great administration, though."</p><p>Former Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok formally opened the Trump-Russia investigation, known inside the bureau as "Crossfire Hurricane" on July 31, 2016.</p><p>Trump fired Comey in May 2017. Days later Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to take over the Crossfire Hurricane probe.</p><p>"He is a very corrupt person. He was absolutely a terrible man for what this country stood for," Trump told Fox News Digital.</p><p>"Comey placed a cloud over the entire nation, and actually, the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax made it very difficult," Trump said. "It could have caused wars."</p><p>Fox News Digital exclusively reported in July that Comey was under criminal investigation by the FBI. </p><p>Fox News Digital also exclusively reported that former CIA Director John Brennan is under criminal investigation related to the Trump–Russia probe. </p><p>When asked whether Brennan should be charged as well, the president told Fox News Digital: "We’ll have to see what happens."</p><p>"It is up to the Justice Department, but I can tell you, it is a group of people that was very disappointing," the president said. "This makes Watergate look like peanuts." </p><p>He added: "They tried to destroy our country."</p><p>Comey's case is being handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.</p><p>The indictment alleges that Comey obstructed a congressional investigation into the disclosure of sensitive information in violation of 18 USC 1505.</p><p>The indictment also alleges Comey made a false statement when he stated he did not authorize someone at the FBI to be an anonymous source. According to the indictment, that statement was false. </p><p>His arraignment is set for 10 a.m. on Oct. 9, in Alexandria Courtroom 600 before District Juge Michael S. Nachmanoff.</p><p>"No one is above the law," Attorney General Pam Bondi said on X. "Today’s indictment reflects this Department of Justice’s commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case."</p><p>FBI Director Kash Patel took to X to say, "Today, your FBI took another step in its promise of full accountability."</p><p>"For far too long, previous corrupt leadership and their enablers weaponized federal law enforcement, damaging once proud institutions and severely eroding public trust," Patel wrote. "Every day, we continue the fight to earn that trust back, and under my leadership, this FBI will confront the problem head-on. Nowhere was this politicization of law enforcement more blatant than during the Russiagate hoax, a disgraceful chapter in history we continue to investigate and expose.</p><p>"Everyone, especially those in positions of power, will be held to account – no matter their perch."</p><p>Meanwhile, after nearly two years, former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, which concluded in March 2019, yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Shortly after, John Durham was appointed as special counsel to investigate the origins of the "Crossfire Hurricane" probe.</p><p>Durham found that the FBI "failed to act" on a "clear warning sign" that the bureau was the "target" of a Clinton-led effort to "manipulate or influence the law enforcement process for political purposes" ahead of the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>"The aforementioned facts reflect a rather startling and inexplicable failure to adequately consider and incorporate the Clinton Plan intelligence into the FBI’s investigative decision-making in the Crossfire Hurricane investigation," Durham’s report states.</p><p>"Indeed, had the FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation as an assessment and, in turn, gathered and analyzed data in concert with the information from the Clinton Plan intelligence, it is likely that the information received would have been examined, at a minimum, with a more critical eye," the report continued.</p><p>Durham, in his report, said the FBI "failed to act on what should have been — when combined with other incontrovertible facts — a clear warning sign that the FBI might then be the target of an effort to manipulate or influence the law enforcement process for political purposes during the 2016 presidential election."</p><p>In an Instagram post on Thursday, Comey acknowledged that he and his family have known for years that there are costs to standing up to President Donald Trump.</p><p>"We couldn’t imagine ourselves living any other way," he said. "We will not live on our knees and you shouldn’t."</p><p><i>Fox News' David Spunt contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

The whole thing stinks," Waltz said. "There’s 150 world leaders there and this only happens to him, not once, not twice, but three times."</p><p>He said the incidents are under investigation by the Secret Service and noted the Secretary General has pledged full cooperation.</p><p>"As the ambassador, I said, you’ve got to open your doors, and some people were kind of shoulder shrugging at this," Waltz said.

We're trying to shift from sort of nightlife into day life. There are so many opportunities to connect with people that aren't just drinking," says Hannah Eyre who co-founded the 'Savannah Ice Tub Club.'  Eyer's events feature an hour-long yoga class followed by an ice tub plunge and sauna session. The concept was born from a desire to connect with people in a healthy, mindful way. And she adds the events offer, "A space for people to be able to show up, to be be able meet new people that are like-minded."  Eyre says, "It just grew into sort of this larger thing that's a part of this large trend towards sobriety and wellness."</p><p>According to Eyre, the roughly 100 to 150 brave participants get a lot of health benefits from dipping in the ice baths, especially if you can submerge yourself in the icy waters for two and a half minutes. "It's good for your inflammation, it's good for your circulation," she adds that it's been beneficial to her too, "the ones that I have seen personally that keep me coming back have been all mental health benefits."</p><p>As younger Americans prioritize mental health, better sleep, and physical fitness, data shows 61% of Gen Zers want to drink less, indicating it's a deeper cultural shift, not just a 'sober curious' trend.  Highlighting this, event ticking site, Eventbrite is seeing a 92% increase in sober gatherings, redefining the traditional night out with a fusion of wellness, music, and authentic community connections.  Eyre enthusiastic about the emerging trend, "It's nice to get to see more and more opportunities for connection beyond drinking or being at the bar."  </p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> Former Vice President Kamala Harris tried to quell a nine-month-pregnant mom's concerns over having a baby boy under the Trump administration, resurrecting a campaign phrase celebrating the "children of the community."</p><p>"Part of how I was raised to think about things was that the children of the community are our children of the community. And we all have some, I think, responsibility — you can call it a moral responsibility, you can think of it in different ways — but to be invested in their well-being and success," Harris said Wednesday evening from The Town Hall theater venue in Midtown Manhattan. </p><p>Harris was in New York City to launch her book tour to promote "107 Days," which offers a detailed and personal retelling of her days on the 2024 presidential campaign trail after then-President Joe Biden dropped out amid mounting concerns over his mental acuity. </p><p>Harris only took a couple questions from the audience, including one from a nine-month-pregnant mom who was concerned about raising a son with a "good heart and moral compass" under "this current political climate."</p><p>Harris quelled the mom's concerns by reassuring her she would teach her son how to be "strong," which would catapult him to "role model" status as an adult. </p><p>"To teach that our own children, that that is the way that we expect that they will live, which is to see the connection between themselves and others, to see the interdependence between themselves and others, and to have a sense of understanding that it's a sign of strength to lift other people up," she continued. </p><p>Harris argued that President Donald Trump has a "perverse notion" that strength is measured by "who you beat down," which she rejected. </p><p>"I used to talk about it a lot in those 107 days, which is this perverse notion that is absolutely being pushed by this guy in the White House, which is to suggest that the measure of strength is based on who you beat down," she said. "Instead, what I think everyone here understands, which is the true measure of strength, is based on who you lift up." </p><p>Harris added that she was excited about the future of the unborn baby under his mom's leadership. </p><p>"You're going to teach him to be strong in every way that is important, and he will be a role model," she continued. "And we are very, very excited for the future of that child." </p><p>Harris repeatedly has used the phrase "the children of the community are the children of the community" while speaking during public events, including as vice president and when she was running for the presidency in 2024. </p><p>Conservative critics and others frequently mocked Harris' "word salad" comments during the election cycle, including in September 2024 when she tied inflation to her "children of the community" phrase. </p><p>"I grew up understanding the children of the community are the children of the community, and we should all have a vested interest in ensuring that children can go grow up with the resources that they need to achieve their God-given potential," Harris said, explaining she wanted to lower the cost of groceries for struggling families and vowing to take on big corporations who gouged customers. </p><p>Harris kicked off her book tour in New York City before traveling to cities from coast to coast to promote her new book, which was released Tuesday. </p><p>Her roughly hourlong conversation Wednesday evening included taking a few shots at Trump, as well as celebrating how former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served as her mentor and supporter throughout the 2024 election. </p></body></div></body></html>

One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI. Today he was indicted by a Grand Jury on two felony counts for various illegal and unlawful acts. He has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" the president wrote.</p><p>Attorney General Pam Bondi also issued a sharp statement on X declaring, "No one is above the law. The American people deserve justice after years of lies and political interference."</p><p>FBI Director Kash Patel amplified that opinion and cast the indictment as part of a broader effort to restore trust in the bureau. </p><p>"Today, your FBI took another step in its promise of full accountability," he wrote. </p><p>"For far too long, corrupt leadership weaponized federal law enforcement, damaging once proud institutions and eroding public trust. Under my leadership, this FBI will confront the problem head-on. No one is above the law."</p><p>U.S. Senator John Cornyn responded noting the gravity of Comey's offenses.</p><p>"While our legal system provides for the presumption of innocence, Comey’s accountability for FBI abuses during the first Trump term are long overdue," he said. "These charges are serious offenses, especially if committed by the head of our nation’s top law enforcement agency, and there must be consequences for any crimes."</p><p>Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called it "a long-awaited correction to years of corruption and cover-ups," while economic adviser Peter Navarro said it proved "justice delayed is not justice denied."</p><p>Democrats condemned the charges as politically motivated. </p><p>Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) denounced what he called a "malicious prosecution," reminding reporters that Trump previously fired a prosecutor who refused to bring "frivolous charges."</p><p>Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, issued an even sharper rebuke. </p><p>"This kind of interference is a dangerous abuse of power," he warned. "By ousting a respected, independent prosecutor and replacing him with a partisan loyalist, Trump is undermining one of the most important U.S. Attorney’s offices in the country and eroding the rule of law itself."</p><p>Republican Rep. Don Bacon, of Nebraska — who announced earlier this year that he will not run for re-election in 2026 — used the term "Lawfare."</p><p>"Lawfare undermines our great country. It didn’t start in Jan, but it didn’t end either. The continued escalation will only hurt us all," the congressman said in a post on X. "Comey has his hands dirty in regards to Lawfare. But, in its totality, this is all bad for us," he opined in another post.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Alex Nitzberg contributed to this report</i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Talk show host Bill Maher argued on Thursday that the Democratic Party’s brand is so tarnished in the eyes of voters that it needs a total outsider like sports commentator Stephen A. Smith to redeem it.</p><p>During an interview on Smith’s "Straight Shooter" podcast, the host, who has flirted with running for the presidency, asked Maher, "Who’s the candidate on the left that can somehow derail [Trump]? Because I don’t see anybody with a national presence that can pull that off. Where are you on that?"</p><p>"I see somebody right here in my Zoom camera," Maher replied.</p><p>Smith denied that he would run, saying he is too careful about giving up his money, but Maher pressed his case, arguing the Democratic Party is a "ghost brand," like one of the major chain stores once ubiquitous in shopping malls that have struggled in recent times but still are remembered by the public. </p><p>Like these stores, Maher argued, it would take "an outsider" who has no sentimental attachment to the Democratic Party’s past who could redeem it.</p><p>"But it would have to be somebody who is unapologetic about calling them out. People have lost faith in the Democratic Party for very good reasons. And you’re the only one I hear who doesn’t look like he cares what the other Democrats will say about it," Maher said.</p><p>"I don’t care. I really don’t," Smith agreed. "I don’t give a damn what they say. I really don’t."</p><p>"I know," Maher agreed, "I don’t either. I’m right where you are. We’re very close on all these things. And I think somebody with that kind of abandon is the only person who is going to win back former Democratic voters who have switched over."</p><p>Maher also praised Newsom’s ability to move to the center on issues but warned he would have to do so "a lot more" to be viable and to separate his image from being associated with far-left policies in California. </p><p>"Do you think a far-lefty can win a national election in this day and age? A presidential election?" Smith asked before saying he didn't think so. </p><p>"I don't think so either," Maher agreed.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Bree Danyele Montoya, a city councilmember representing Norman, Oklahoma's Ward 3, resigned effective immediately Tuesday after a Facebook comment she wrote telling a Trump supporter to harm herself resurfaced and went viral when shared by Libs of TikTok.</p><p>The resignation followed months of inaction from the city council, critics say, until the exchange gained national traction online. The City of Norman has since emphasized that while elected officials speak for themselves, it "does not support actions or behaviors that may encourage harm."</p><p>"In various capacities, I have served this community since 2008, and I am ready to pursue other interests. Effective immediately, I am resigning as councilmember for Ward 3. Thank you, Ward 3," Montoya said at the meeting.</p><p>The recipient of Montoya’s comments, constituent Audra Abbott, told FOX affiliate KOKH she was shocked when she realized who had written them. </p><p>"I saw that she was a city council member within moments of her posting it, and I was like, ‘Wow, I can’t believe that an elected official would talk like that online,’" she said.</p><p>"If it hadn’t went viral with Libs of TikTok picking it up, I don’t think that anything would have happened at all."</p><p>Chaya Raichik, who runs Libs of TikTok, told Fox News Digital, "With a rising trend of violent left-wing extremists targeting conservatives, it is our duty to hold elected officials, such as Oklahoma City Councilor Bree Montoya, accountable for violent rhetoric, regardless of their status or position.</p><p>"While the fake news media refuses to acknowledge the truth of the rising epidemic of far-left violence, Libs of TikTok will continue to expose elected leaders who promote violence, demonize ICE, or issue threatening statements against the American people."</p><p>In an email to Fox News Digital, Norman Chief Communications Officer Tiffany Martinez Vrska said, "The City of Norman as a municipal corporation does not support actions or behaviors that may encourage harm; carrying out municipal functions that provide or support public service remains the focus of the corporation." She added that elected officials speak only for themselves when making personal remarks. Officials pointed to resources explaining Norman’s council–manager government structure and how the Ward 3 vacancy will be filled in the coming weeks.</p><p>The online clash dates back to June, when Montoya and Abbott argued on Facebook about the size of a "No Kings" protest. Montoya called Abbott "uneducated" and escalated by telling her to harm herself. </p><p>Screenshots of the exchange spread in local Facebook groups during the summer before Libs of TikTok recently amplified them on social media. Abbott and others say Norman officials ignored the controversy until the post gained traction online. Montoya was first elected in 2023, re-elected in February 2025, sworn in again July 1 and resigned less than three months later.</p><p>At the Sept. 23 meeting, Mayor Stephen Tyler Holman addressed the incident.</p><p>"As your mayor, I want to affirm our commitment to upholding the rights guaranteed under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The right to free speech is fundamental to our democracy, and it is our responsibility to ensure that every citizen has the opportunity to express their opinions and be heard," the mayor said.</p><p>"While we honor the right to free speech, we must also maintain an environment that is respectful, orderly and conducive to productive discussion," Holman added. "My goal is to ensure that every voice in this room can be heard while maintaining the integrity and decorum of our meetings. I ask for your cooperation and mutual respect as we continue to work together for the betterment of Norman."</p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Tim Allen is speaking out about how Erika Kirk's memorial speech "deeply affected" him.</p><p>On Thursday, Allen took to X to share that he was personally moved by Kirk's forgiveness of the man who allegedly killed her husband, Charlie Kirk, since forgiveness has not been as easy for him to give.</p><p>"When Erika Kirk spoke the words on the man who killed her husband — ‘That man … that young man … I forgive him’ — that moment deeply affected me."</p><p>"I have struggled for over 60 years to forgive the man who killed my Dad. I will say those words now as I type: ‘I forgive the man who killed my father.’ Peace be with you all," Allen wrote.</p><p>Allen's father died in 1964 after a drunk driver's vehicle collided with his vehicle. Allen was 11 years old at the time of his father's death.</p><p>At Charlie's memorial service on Sunday, Erika publicly forgave Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old who is accused of killing the Turning Point USA founder.</p><p>Charlie "wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life," she said. </p><p>"Our Savior said, 'Father, forgive them, for they not know what they do.' That young man … I forgive him," Erika said. "I forgive him because it was what Christ did, and it's what Charlie would do."</p><p>Charlie was assassinated at a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10 in Orem, Utah. </p><p>Robinson was arrested and is facing several charges, including aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, obstruction of justice, witness tampering and violent offense in the presence of a child.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>For the first time since 1935 at Ridgewood Country Club in Paramus, New Jersey, the Ryder Cup will be played in the New York City metro area, as Team USA and Team Europe will spend the weekend at the famed Bethpage Black on Long Island.</p><p>It was announced that this year's Ryder Cup would take place at Bethpage Black, famously recommended "only for highly skilled golfers" on Sept. 17, 2013. Originally, this was supposed to be the 2024 Ryder Cup, but the pandemic postponed the 2020 Ryder Cup, pushing back each of the events that followed.</p><p>This was actually the second time the Ryder Cup had been delayed, the first being in 2001 due to the Sept. 11 terror attacks. So, the Ryder Cup, which originally was planned to take place in odd-numbered years, has reverted to its old ways. </p><p></p><p>Now, after nearly 12 years since the announcement, golfers will finally tee off shortly after 7 a.m. ET on Friday. NBC, USA and Peacock will be streaming the events.</p><p>The Ryder Cup began in 1927, originally as a competition between the United States and Great Britain and Ireland. But the Americans dominated, and Jack Nicklaus was part of expanding the overseas team to include all of Europe beginning in 1979, changing the tournament forever.</p><p>The change brought in legends like Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer and Sandy Lyle, and Europe became a legitimate force. Since the expansion, there have been 22 Ryder Cups, and Europe has a 12-9-1 record in that span. That includes the U.S. winning the first three Ryder Cups since the European expansion.</p><p>The biennial match-play tournament is a three-day event with five different sessions. Friday and Saturday see four fourball matches and four alternate-shot matches split between the morning and afternoon. On Sunday, all 24 players go one-on-one in singles matches.</p><p>A total of 28 points are up for grabs, so a team needs 14.5 points to win the Ryder Cup. However, since Team Europe won the last event, a tie would result in it retaining the trophy until 2027.</p><p>Team USA, captained by Keegan Bradley, consists of Scottie Scheffler, J.J. Spaun, Xander Schauffele, Russell Henley, Harris English, Bryson DeChambeau, Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, Cameron Young, Ben Griffin, Patrick Cantlay and Sam Burns. Bradley had the opportunity to select himself but ultimately chose not to.</p><p>Luke Donald is bringing back just about his entire winning team from 2023. The only difference is Rasmus Hojgaard taking the place of his twin brother, Nicolai. Hojgaard will join Rory McIlroy, Robert MacIntyre, Tommy Fleetwood, Justin Rose, Tyrrell Hatton, Shane Lowry, Sepp Straka, Ludvig Aberg, Viktor Hovland, Matt Fitzpatrick and Jon Rahm.</p><p>Team Europe has a chance to break a pair of streaks because no team has won back-to-back Ryder Cups since Europe won three straight from 2010 to 2014. That 2012 European team also remains the last to win a Ryder Cup on the road.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>
