                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New York Mets broadcaster Gary Cohen criticized Chicago Cubs player Matt Shaw for missing one of the team's games this past weekend to attend Charlie Kirk's funeral. </p><p>Cohen's comments came during SNY's broadcast of the Mets' game against the Cubs on Tuesday night, while Shaw was up to bat in fourth inning, calling the decision "weird." </p><p>"I don't want to talk about any of the politics of it, but the thought of leaving your team in the middle of a race for any reason other than a family emergency, really strikes me as weird," Cohen said. </p><p>Fellow Mets broadcaster Todd Zeile called Shaw's absence "unprecedented." </p><p>"It's unusual, I think it's unprecedented at least from my experience as a player, and I think it made it a little more unusual that it was not revealed until after it came to issue because he was thought to be in the dugout and maybe available, and was not, and that's how it was revealed," Zeile said. </p><p>Cohen and Zeile were criticized on social media for their comments about Shaw's absence. </p><p>Shaw missed the Cubs’ 1-0 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday to attend the memorial service in Glendale, though manager Craig Counsell mentioned to the media that Shaw wasn’t available for the game because he was at a funeral for a friend. </p><p>Shaw explained why he made it a point to attend the memorial despite his team’s schedule.</p><p>"My connection with Charlie was through our [Christian] faith," Shaw said before the Cubs opened a new series with the New York Mets on Tuesday, per the Chicago Sun-Times. "And that’s something that drives me every day, the reason why I’m able to do what I do every day, and that’s something I’m extremely thankful for. </p><p>"I know without my faith and without the many blessings I’ve been given in my life, that I wouldn’t be here, be able to talk to you guys, able to help this team eventually go and win championships.</p><p>"That’s something I feel really, really blessed about, so whatever backlash comes is OK. I feel strong about my faith and that what was meant to be happened."</p><p>Shaw added that he and Kirk became friends last offseason as they lived in the same apartment complex in Arizona. The two stayed in contact throughout the MLB season, Shaw said. </p><p>Shaw said he was emotional when he found out Kirk was assassinated while at a speaking event at Utah Valley University Sept. 10. </p><p>"When that happened, a lot of emotions came over me," he explained. "I didn’t foresee that happening. I don’t know how to describe everything that happened, how I was feeling, But I will say I was tearing up pretty good. I had a lot of [teammates] supporting me, and that will be something I’ll remember for my entire life."</p><p>Shaw had been scratched from the Cubs’ lineup that night before a game against the Atlanta Braves. </p><p>Kirk, a native of Arlington Heights, a northern suburb of Chicago, was "one of the biggest Cubs fans I ever Met," according to Shaw. In fact, Shaw said it was Erika Kirk, his widow, who asked him to attend the memorial. After a conversation with Counsell and some teammates, Shaw felt his decision to attend was accepted. </p><p>"The reason Charlie and I connected so close was because of our faith," Shaw added. "That’s something that drives me every single day, something that I think about all the time. So, if people are wondering who I am and what I stand for, I’d say that my faith and the many blessings I’ve been given are why I’m able to be here, and I just want to make sure that I can give that back to people, that I can support people around me, that I can love people around me the same way that I’ve been blessed."</p><p>The Cubs were among the MLB teams to pay tribute to Kirk, calling for an end to "all political violence." </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Once a member of al Qaeda and the Islamic State and now leading Syria’s fragile transition since toppling the Bashar Assad regime, Ahmed al-Sharaa is ready to take to the global center stage at the United Nations General Assembly Wednesday and make his case for a new path forward for his war-torn nation.</p><p>"This marks the first participation in high-level meetings of a Syrian president at the United Nations General Assembly since 1967, so this is a very big deal," Natasha Hall, senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Fox News Digital.</p><p>"On such a historic occasion, what he will try to emphasize and underline is that this is a new day for Syria. They have overthrown the brutal dictatorship of the Assad regime. He will talk about the progress that's been made and what more progress needs to happen in terms of recognition and the lifting of U.N. sanctions to help Syria move forward," Hall added.</p><p>A high-ranking Syrian government official confirmed to Fox News Digital that al-Sharaa will use the opportunity at the U.N. to present Syria’s vision for stability, reconstruction, and reconciliation.</p><p>"The most important issues he will raise include the need to lift all forms of unilateral sanctions that continue to hinder Syria’s recovery, the importance of combating terrorism in all its forms, the return of displaced Syrians and refugees, and the advancement of a genuinely inclusive political process rooted in the will of the Syrian people," the Syrian official said.</p><p>Al-Sharaa, who led the Islamist rebel group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) to victory over Assad, ditched his military fatigues for a Western-style suit and has been on a charm offensive, hosting European and Western diplomats and politicians in hopes of bringing Syria out from its international pariah status.</p><p>The new Syrian leader received an unprecedented endorsement from President Donald Trump when the two met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in May. </p><p>Trump called al-Sharaa a "young, attractive, tough guy," announcing that the U.S. would lift sanctions in place since the Assad era and even discussed normalizing relations. </p><p>Hall noted that al-Sharaa might be looking to secure a security pact between Israel and Syria along the UNGA sidelines, emphasizing that he seeks a Syria that is at peace with its neighbors and doesn't want to position Syria to be a threat to any outside forces, particularly Israel. </p><p>He will also be looking to secure much-needed reconstruction aid to rebuild a country ravaged by 13 years of civil war. The cost for reconstruction is estimated to be between $250 and $400 billion, and 16.7 million people, or 75% of the population, are in dire need of humanitarian assistance, according to the U.N.</p><p>Since seizing Damascus, he has publicly said all the right things. He promised an inclusive government that would represent all religious and ethnic factions in Syria, uphold women’s rights, and protect minority rights.</p><p>Al-Sharaa also fulfilled promises to target ISIS and other terrorist groups operating in Syria. One month after taking power, Syrian security forces seized a shipment of heavy ammunition destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon, once a key ally of the Assad regime and Iran’s Axis of Resistance.</p><p>While optimism for a new Syria remains high, some caution it’s still too soon to judge al-Sharaa as a Western ally given his terrorist past.</p><p>"Al-Sharaa is not a democrat. He ruled Idlib without power-sharing. So far, in terms of control of vital government functions like security, foreign affairs, intelligence and justice, he has put loyalists in place," former U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Ford, who was the last U.S. ambassador in Damascus in 2011, said the crucial question is whether, over time, individual political and civil liberties will be respected and that people maintain, as they have now, the freedom to organize and protest.</p><p>"Al-Sharaa's heavy hand ruling Idlib prior to Assad's fall has been lighter in Damascus, Aleppo and elsewhere. But so far, there is more political freedom to speak and protest in Syria than in many other countries in the region, such as Egypt, Algeria and some Gulf states," Ford added.</p><p>Ambassador Barbara Leaf, who served as assistant secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, visited Damascus and met with Shara in December, becoming the highest-ranking official to meet with Syrian leadership since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011. </p><p>Leaf, a distinguished diplomatic fellow with the Middle East Institute, told Fox News Digital about her initial contact with Shara right after HTS overthrew Assad. Her mission was to get eyes on him, to assess him and to send a clear signal on U.S. expectations if he was going to lead a new Syria.</p><p>"My takeaway from the meeting was that he came across as somebody who was very well-prepared for the discussion. He had clearly anticipated all of the topics that I raised and he had pretty thoughtful responses with a readiness to engage," she said.</p><p>Al-Sharaa made a point several times to say that Syria would no longer be a threat or a staging point for threats against its neighbors, including Israel, and that he would not allow the Iranians, Hezbollah, or Palestinian groups, to use Syrian territory to conduct terrorist activities, the ambassador said.</p><p>"I came to the sense that he was already making a shift from being a military commander to being a politician, to being a political leader," Ambassador Leaf noted.</p><p>While Ambassador Leaf highlighted his pragmatism, his true intentions as the new leader of Syria remain murky.</p><p>The ambassador said that it appears al-Sharaa has traveled a trajectory away from his jihadist terrorist past, but it remains a question how far he is willing to go to effectuate what she believes is an intention to form an Islamist style of governance.</p><p>"Does he want to formulate a kind of Islamist governance, conservative governance and social order that, frankly, Syria has not seen? And would he be willing to use force to get there? That's an unknown," the ambassador cautioned.</p><p>What’s concerning for Ambassador Leaf and others is that many of the people serving in key roles in the transitional government are close associates of al-Sharaa and others affiliated with HTS and other allied armed rebel groups. </p><p>"Al-Sharaa is still engaged in a careful balancing act within his own government between liberal opposition voices, former regime bureaucrats and more Islamist proponents aligned still with HTS’ mission and principles," Caroline Rose, director of The New Lines Institute, told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Rose, who traveled to Syria earlier this year, said that Syria's complex political dynamics have led not only to gridlock but even incapacity in times of crisis, "such as failure to rein in radical Sunni fighters during violent outbreaks in Latakia and Suwayda, but also policies appeasing more conservative elements of al-Sharaa’s support network, such as the ruling requiring full-body swimwear at Syrian pools and beaches."</p><p>While Syria’s new government has looked to consolidate control over a restive society, Shara’s forces had to manage a fragile society divided along ethnic and religious lines.</p><p>Syria has experienced a wave of sectarian violence since the revolution to overthrow Assad. Government security forces retaliated after forces loyal to the Assad regime launched an attack in the coastal city of Latakia, Assad’s hometown. In total, around 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were massacred, according to the U.N. Most of the victims from the Alawites, a minority group in Syria, which the Assad family belonged to, as well as from the Druze community.</p><p>It was the worst episode of violence since the overthrow of Assad in December 2024.</p><p>Clashes between Bedouin tribes, Druze militias, and government forces in Suweida led to hundreds of deaths and drew in Israeli military intervention — to protect Syria's Druze minority. A ceasefire was eventually agreed to but the spiraling ethnic violence highlights Syria's rocky transition. </p><p>The country's dwindling Christian community has also felt the brunt of extremist violence. In June, the Islamic State was suspected of carrying out a deadly suicide bombing at a Greek Orthodox church in Syria, which killed 22 worshipers and injured 63 others. Christians have also been attacked and, in some cases, killed, allegedly by forces tied to the al-Sharaa government. </p><p>The new authorities will also have to incorporate Kurdish forces operating in Northeast Syria, where the Syrian Democratic Forces have been crucial to the U.S.-led counter-ISIS campaign. Any disruptions in the merging of the SDF into the Syrian state raises the risk of an ISIS resurgence.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> The Utah County Sheriff's Office said the suspect accused of assassinating Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk remains within a "special housing unit" of a jail, even though his mental evaluation has been completed.</p><p>Kirk was taken to a local hospital in critical condition following the shooting on Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, where he later died, officials said. Tyler Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder, two counts of obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, two counts of witness tampering and commission of a violent offense in the presence of a child.</p><p>Utah County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Ray Ormond told Fox News Digital on Tuesday that Robinson saw mental and medical staff at the jail, but will remain within the special housing unit.</p><p>"Robinson has been seen by our medical and mental health staff. Due to patient privacy regulations, I'm not able to [go] further into that," Ormond said. "Robinson will stay in our special housing unit for the time being."</p><p>When asked if Robinson will remain in the special housing unit indefinitely, Ormond said, "That's not set in stone and his housing location may change down the road."</p><p>Previously, the law enforcement agency said Robinson would remain on a special watch status in the Utah County Sheriff's Department special housing unit so staff could "keep an eye on him" until he cleared a mental health screening.</p><p>"Special watch" status is done for several reasons, including violent behavior, type of crime, suicidal comments and behavioral issues, the department said.</p><p>Previously, the department said it wasn't aware of Robinson making any suicidal comments.</p><p>Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Fox News Digital the mental health evaluation likely "suggests that he should not be housed with the general population," as Robinson remains within a "special housing unit."</p><p>"A full mental health evaluation will be conducted by his defense team to try to negotiate a plea deal to save his life, to put on an insanity or diminished capacity defense during the guilt phase, which is challenging under Utah law, or to put on evidence of mitigation during the death penalty phase," Rahmani said.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Antifa activist Gabriel Nadales praised President Donald Trump’s executive order designating Antifa a domestic terrorist organization, telling Fox News the step was long overdue.</p><p>"This is a long time coming, and I hope that Congress really follows suit and helps define what this means," Nadales said Tuesday on "Fox &amp; Friends First."</p><p>His appearance on the Fox News Channel came days after Trump signed an executive order with the formal designation, asserting that the left-wing activist group poses a direct threat to the U.S. government, law enforcement and rule of law.</p><p>Nadales, who has said he left Antifa as his political beliefs shifted, said Trump's order means that many of the "self-described" and "localized" groups under the Antifa umbrella could now be labeled domestic terrorist organizations.</p><p>"There's this idea that Antifa is merely an idea and, to an extent, that is true, but Antifa is a very collective or a specified set of ideas that believes in political violence to enact its own political goals. That is literally the definition of terrorism," he said.</p><p>"So if you call Antifa just an idea, it is literally the idea of terrorism itself."</p><p>Trump's order branded Antifa as a "militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States government, law enforcement authorities, and our system of law." </p><p>"It uses illegal means to organize and execute a campaign of violence and terrorism nationwide to accomplish these goals."</p><p>Antifa claims to be an "anti-fascist" movement that also opposes white supremacy and far-right extremism.</p><p>The group, however, has come under fire for wearing all black and concealing their identities and using tactics like doxxing, violence and intimidation.</p><p>Nadales said giving Antifa the "domestic terrorist" label could have two effects: first, helping law enforcement address what he called "terror cells," and second, launching a public-relations battle challenging the group’s identity as "anti-fascist."</p><p>"Antifa continues to claim itself as the anti-fascist, and [say], 'If you are against Antifa, you're pro-fascist,' but nothing can be further from the truth," he said. </p><p>"To combat Antifa is to combat political violence, no matter where it comes from, because, to a great extent, a lot of these Antifa activists, they are themselves the terrorists, they are themselves the fascists, so labeling them as domestic terror groups, it really helps in the battle against Antifa in the PR realm, because it really shows them for what they are. They are a domestic terrorist movement."</p><p><i>Fox News' Alexandra Koch and Sophia Compton contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Archaeologists in Israel recently found an ancient treasure hoard dating back more than 1,600 years – not far from where Jesus carried out much of His ministry.</p><p>The coins were found at Hukok, a kibbutz in northern Israel, according to the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA). Hukok is roughly three miles west of Capernaum, an ancient fishing town where Jesus preached and performed miracles.</p><p>Hukok and Capernaum are part of the Galilee region, which stretches from Israel's Jezreel Valley to the border of Lebanon.</p><p>The coins, however, were not contemporary to Jesus. The IAA said that they date back to the 4th century A.D., over 1,600 years ago.</p><p>They were left by Jews during the Gallus Revolt, the last Jewish uprising under Roman rule, between 351 and 352 AD.</p><p>The hoard consists of 22 bronze coins found "in a small crevice prepared deep in an underground hiding complex," the IAA noted.</p><p>IAA researcher Uri Berger said the hoard's location suggests it was "carefully planned its hiding place, [with its owners] hoping to return to it when the threatening troubles were over."</p><p>The coins were found in a pit at the end of a narrow, winding tunnel.</p><p>Interestingly, the hiding complex also dates back to earlier revolts, such as the Great Revolt in the first century A.D. and the Bar-Kochba Revolt, between 132 and 136 A.D.</p><p>"This shows that hundreds of years after these tunnels were dug out, they were reused," the IAA noted. </p><p>"The hoard provides, in all probability, unique evidence that this hiding complex was used in one way or another during another crisis – during the Gallus Revolt – a rebellion for which we have only scant historical evidence of its existence."</p><p>Researchers were "great[ly] surprised" by the discovery, which was found by volunteers excavating the complex for tourism development.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, it was the many volunteers excavating the hiding complex who actually uncovered this important treasure, and they enjoyed this great moment of the joy and excitement of discovery," the IAA's Einat Ambar-Armon said. </p><p>"The excavation thus became not only an important scientific event, but also a significant communal educational experience – one that brings the public closer to its heritage, and strengthens the sense of belonging and the connection to the past."</p><p>In a statement, IAA director Eli Escusido said he hopes the Hukok site will "be a magnet for tourists from Israel and the world."</p><p>He added, "We are working together so that the entire public can enjoy the hidden treasures of this site."</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-title">Princess Diana found unexpected political ally during marriage crisis: book</div>
                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Princess Diana had an unexpected political ally during the public breakdown of her marriage.</p><p>Royal author Valentine Low has written a new book, "Power and the Palace," which details the relationship between the British royal family and the government over the years. </p><p>In the book, Low describes how former Prime Minister Sir John Major quietly served as a mediator between the "warring Waleses" while also being a "sympathetic listener to Diana at a time when she felt at her most alone."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Major, 82, for comment.</p><p>"People don’t realize this about John Major, but he … is a very warm, empathetic man," Low told Fox News Digital. "He did his best to talk to both Charles and Diana at that time. … He wasn’t going to try and bring them back together again, but he was trying to make sure that the whole crisis passed off without too much unnecessary drama, unnecessary unpleasantness, and that afterward, Diana would find some kind of role."</p><p>"I think it was very important in John Major’s eyes that Diana found a role after separating from Charles," Low added.</p><p>According to the book, Alex Allan, Major’s private secretary, said the prime minister had "a number of sessions with both Charles and Diana." When one royal had a meeting with him, the other would quickly ask if they could have a sit-down too. </p><p>Allan noted that while Major was not trying to stop the separation, he was "quite concerned" about Diana, in particular. Lord Butler, who was cabinet secretary at the time, felt that Major offered Diana "a shoulder to cry on."</p><p>"Diana tragically relied on numerous mystics, astrologers and spiritualists as she was so desperately lonely," royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams told Fox News Digital. "Major was soft-spoken and had a personable manner. His approach as broker endeared him to both Charles and Diana, winning the trust of the warring parties, in itself a monumental feat."</p><p>"Diana talked to people when she felt relaxed in their company," British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital. "I imagine Major offered Diana a safe space. However, he would have also been concerned about … Diana’s future position. He wanted to ensure a smooth separation process."</p><p>Diana’s private secretary, Patrick Jephson, told Low in his book that Major kept in regular contact with Diana, who yearned for a friend during a dark period in her life.</p><p>"Major would come and visit Diana quite frequently in the run-up to the separation and afterward," said Jephson. </p><p>"They would have tea, just the two of them. It was great, because always afterward, she was encouraged, she was buoyed up. She would refer to him fondly as ‘the Hon. John.’ … I got the very clear message that he enjoyed those meetings. He was there to be an honest broker, to be a source of practical help if she needed it, and to help her find happiness. Or at least contentment in what she was doing."</p><p>Low told Fox News Digital that Major has always been fiercely protective of his private conversations with Diana. Major never wanted to exploit Diana’s trust, Low pointed out.</p><p>"I’d like to say something about what John Major’s private conversations with Diana revealed, because I’m sure they revealed all sorts of absolutely fascinating things," said Low. "But John Major is one of the most discreet people known to man and has given away no details whatsoever about his conversations with any member of the royal family and never will."</p><p>Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital he believed that Major’s concerns for Diana were the real deal.</p><p>"I worked behind the scenes with the John Major government," he explained. </p><p>"I played a very small part in him becoming prime minister and then was asked to take his official inaugural photographs … The reality is, John Major understood loneliness. … When he saw the emotions in Diana, he reached out to help her. He saw it as his constitutional duty, but also, Major came from a middle-class background, unlike his contemporaries, who came from wealthy backgrounds."</p><p>"Diana was ‘The People’s Princess,’" Turner pointed out. "Major was very much a man for the people. So intuitively, he offered support. It was in his power to help, but also in his heart too."</p><p>Still, Fitzwilliams believed Major "undoubtedly misled Parliament" when he announced in 1992 that Charles and Diana had decided to separate but had "no plans to divorce." </p><p>"That was hardly practical," said Fitzwilliams.</p><p>For four more years, Charles and Diana continued to tear each other apart in public, Esquire reported. Each gave televised tell-alls about their crumbling union. In 1995, Diana famously sat down with the BBC’s "Panorama" and declared, "There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded." She was referring to her estranged husband's mistress and longtime love, Camilla Parker Bowles.</p><p>The outlet noted that this was the last straw for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, who were still hoping the pair could work out their differences. The queen finally allowed them to get an official divorce.</p><p>The divorce was finalized in 1996.</p><p>"Diana essentially reinvented herself," said Chard. "She recognized her superpower as ‘The People’s Princess’ and threw herself into charity work … and connecting with people. </p><p>"This led her to being known and loved as the ‘Queen of People’s Hearts.’ She felt free and independent away from the institution and realized how the media helped her tell her story and sway public opinion. She used the press strategically."</p><p>A former royal aide also told Low that Major did his best to make Prince William and Prince Harry feel they were cared for as their parents’ breakup played out on the world stage.</p><p>"He was an important, sympathetic, helpful mentoring figure," said the aide.</p><p>"He is a very genuine person, very natural," Sir Malcolm Rifkind said, as quoted in Low’s book. "He is a very warm but also very astute person. He is the sort of person that, if you did have something very personal that you wanted to discuss in private, you would feel comfortable doing that."</p><p>Diana’s claim of independence was brief. In 1997, the Princess of Wales died from injuries sustained in a Paris car crash. She was 36.</p><p>Major was in office from 1990 to 1997. Town &amp; Country reported that following Diana’s death, Major was appointed special guardian to her sons, a role suggested by Charles. This made Major responsible for the legal and administrative matters relating to the princes. </p><p>In 2005, the queen appointed Major a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. Then in 2012, he became chairman of the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust.</p><p>His relationship with the royal family remained close. Over the years, he appeared at events supporting the Trust, often alongside the queen or other members of the royal family, the outlet shared. </p><p>Major attended both Prince William’s wedding to Kate Middleton in 2011, and Prince Harry's marriage to Meghan Markle in 2018. He also attended the queen’s funeral in 2022 and the more private service afterward.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-title">Pastors hail Erika Kirk’s forgiveness of husband's accused killer as powerful testimony to Christian faith</div>
                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Jesus Christ’s 2,000-year-old call to believers to love their enemies was vividly demonstrated Sunday when Erika Kirk publicly forgave her husband’s alleged killer before an audience of millions.</p><p>Charlie Kirk, 31, was gunned down Sept. 10 while speaking at a Utah campus. Prosecutors filed murder charges against suspect Tyler Robinson, who admitted to shooting Kirk in a text message to his roommate and transgender partner, saying that he "had enough of [Kirk's] hatred."</p><p>After losing her husband — and as some fringe figures celebrated his killing — Erika Kirk delivered a tearful message of forgiveness at his memorial service.</p><p>"My husband, Charlie. He wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life. On the cross, Our Savior said, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.' That young man… I forgive him," Kirk said. "I forgive him because it was what Christ did, and it's what Charlie would do."</p><p>"The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the Gospel is love — always love. Love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us," she continued.</p><p>Faith leaders across the country praised her words as one of the most powerful public acts of Christian witness in years.</p><p>Bishop Robert Barron, founder of Word on Fire Ministries and bishop of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota, attended the memorial. He called it "one of the most impressive and moving displays of the Gospel I have ever experienced."</p><p>"Jesus speaks of loving and forgiving our enemies, but this is one of the very hardest of his teachings to realize in practice. That Erika Kirk was able to pronounce a word of forgiveness to her husband’s assassin, even as her heart must have been breaking, was breathtaking," he told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Her remarks, broadcast to millions, were "extraordinarily significant," Barron added. "She became in that moment a brilliant evangelist, not so much through the intellectual articulation of the faith but the enactment of it."</p><p>The comments drove international headlines and praise from across the political spectrum.</p><p>Rev. Franklin Graham, president and CEO of Samaritan’s Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, said countless people around the world witnessed the power of God through Kirk's testimony.</p><p>"The world just witnessed something incredible. Erika Kirk — while grieving the death of her husband and the father of their two young children — forgave his killer. Erika did it so well, straight from her heart," Graham told Fox News Digital. "To forgive like this is very difficult to do. It is possible only through the grace of God."</p><p>Pastor Jack Hibbs of Calvary Chapel Chino Hills said her message showed that God’s grace is stronger than evil.</p><p>"When she said, ‘I forgive that young man,’ she could only do that from the strength of God because Erika knows what it’s like to be forgiven," Hibbs told Fox News Digital. "And by doing that, she set herself free from that man’s act of horrific violence… At the same time, she sends a message to this young man that her act of goodness and grace is greater and much more powerful than his act of evil."</p><p>The Christian leaders noted that Kirk's message and the peaceful mourning of believers stood in stark contrast to people online celebrating Kirk’s death.</p><p>"There was no bitterness. There were no protests, no hatred, no violence," Graham said. "There have been very few times when I have seen the name of Jesus Christ lifted up for the world to see quite like this, and I am grateful to Erika for showing millions of people around the world what it looks like to live — and forgive — like Christ."</p><p>Barron called the celebrations over Kirk's death evidence of "a deep rot in our culture" that Christians are meant to confront.</p><p>"Christians are called upon by Christ to be light in the darkness," he said. "They have to go into the dysfunctional parts of our culture and bring the spirit of Jesus. And so we reach out, especially to those in greatest moral peril, with love, forgiveness, and an invitation to repent."</p><p>Hibbs pointed to Jesus' warning to believers that the world would hate them, but said Christians have hope in the midst of hostility.</p><p>"And we are actually seeing that [play out today]," he said. "But the Christian rejoices. We know that heaven is for real and that this life is short. And so we want to make sure that others know that they too can be forgiven like we have been forgiven and that Christ died for that very reason. That's what the whole story of the Bible is about. And so we find great comfort even in the hostility. There's a message of comfort to us because we understand."</p><p>The Christian leaders were hopeful that Kirk's act of forgiveness would embolden Christians to fearlessly live out their faith and could spark revival worldwide.</p><p>"I believe there are many people harboring hatred and unforgiveness in their hearts today. It is my prayer that God will use Erika’s message and example to move people to forgive. This could result in countless changed lives across our nation and around the world," Graham said.</p><p>Christian singer Chris Tomlin, who led worship at the service, also said Kirk's words could plant the seeds for a spiritual awakening.</p><p>"That kind of forgiveness can only come from somebody who really walks with God," Tomlin told The Christian Post. "And for people to see that and witness that — what a moment around the world. I think so many people came to faith yesterday, thousands and thousands of people. And I pray it’s an awakening in this nation."</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>"[T]here’s no other government," said the United States secretary of State, "that’s cooperating as much with us in the fight against crime as the Government of Mexico." Issued several days ago from the Palacio Nacional in Mexico City, with the uppermost tier of Mexico’s political elite beaming approvingly, it was a bold statement for Marco Rubio to make.  </p><p>It’s a big win for them, in their desperation to ward off what they see as a series of worst-case outcomes, among them tariffs, the end of United States–Mexico–Canada trade agreement (USMCA), American extraditions of their cartel-connected political class, and U.S. military strikes in their country. In this context, the praise from Rubio — perceived as a Latin America hawk in general — comes as a tremendous relief. They will, at minimum, wield it as validation the next time any other American suggests Mexico isn’t doing enough.  </p><p>From Mexico’s perspective, it is nearly a get-out-of-jail-free card. The question is what, exactly, it means.  </p><p>To borrow a phrase, Rubio’s affirmation is "big, if true." It is so big, in fact, that it begs a great many questions — none of them answered or answerable in the public sphere. As longtime observers of Mexican affairs know, exemplary cooperation with the United States has not been a hallmark of Mexican governance for well over a decade now.  </p><p>What used to be an exceptionally close security relationship was first dented under the Mexican presidency of Enrique Peña Nieto, from 2012-2018, and then almost totally severed under his successor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, from 2018-2024. Peña Nieto presided over a political structure shot through with corruption, and Lopez Obrador, himself, reportedly has had a long relationship with the Sinaloa Cartel for at least the past 20 years.  </p><p>All this combined to produce a Mexican state that was an antagonist, not a partner, to the United States — a narco-state in all but name, and moreover an active ally of hemispheric dictatorships including the ones in Cuba and Venezuela.  </p><p>The present administration of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Lopez Obrador’s handpicked successor, has labored to present a different image, if not necessarily a different reality, for American consumption. Threatened early by the Trump administration with American military action against its allied cartels, Sheinbaum’s regime did several things that the Mexican state could have done all along, including closing the border and extraditing narcos by the dozen.  </p><p>All these measures are necessary, from the American perspective — and also tactical at best. What it has never done, as far as we know, is address the strategic problem undergirding all the rest: the longstanding collusion between the regime and its criminal cartels. </p><p>That collusion is neither minor nor the mere background noise of Mexican civics. It is rather fundamental to the MORENA regime — the political party of both Lopez Obrador and Sheinbaum — and has been essential to the consolidation of its power. Nearly unnoticed in American policy discourse, that regime has been busily transforming Mexican society into an autocratic left-populist state akin to that which unfolded to disastrous effect in Venezuela.  </p><p>In this framework, cartel money and guns have been essential in delivering elections, curbing independent public life and enriching key powerholders, by which the coalition holds together. It is an open secret in today’s Mexico that though Sheinbaum herself is likely not corrupt — she is that most fleeting phenomenon in Latin America, the pure ideologue — her regime is stacked with those who are. There are recipients of cartel funds in Mexico’s Senate, Congress, governorships and beyond. </p><p>These men and women are the fulcrum, the essential link, between Mexico’s state and its cartels, and until they are dealt with, any arrangement with Mexico — no matter how quiet the border is, and no matter how many narcos are sent north — is temporary. The problem is unsolved so long as the state-cartel alliance remains in effect.  </p><p>This is also precisely the class of culpable figures that Sheinbaum has left untouched, and unworried by anything like justice. Absent that action, it is quite difficult to say that "there is no other government that is cooperating as much with [America] against criminality than the Mexican government." Yet Secretary Rubio did say that, and so we return to the original question: why? </p><p>We must be open to three major possibilities.  </p><p>One is that the United States is treading the well-worn pathway of showering the Mexicans with unearned praise, in the hopes of appealing to their better natures. This is a dreary norm in our communications with them — which never yields the hoped-for outcomes — and we should be open to the possibility that more of the same is at work here.  </p><p>Another possibility is that the current level of cooperation, such as it is, is deemed sufficient by the United States, and we are content with leaving Mexico’s fundamental strategic problem unaddressed. This would be a tremendous error — a worse crisis is therefore an inevitability — but there is a constituency for it within the American bureaucracy. </p><p>The final possibility, and the one for which we hope, is that the secretary of State is dead-on right — and there is much more underway behind the scenes than we know. Perhaps real action against Mexico’s narco-state apparatus is forthcoming, and both the Americans and President Sheinbaum are in on it.  </p><p>We can hope for it, and we do, but at some point, we have to know. Inside Mexico policy circles, a conversational commonplace is that we won’t know until 2028 or so, at the opening of Sheinbaum’s second half of her six-year term — not at all coincidentally, right at the point at which the accountability brought by the Trump administration will be in its final months. If this is the case, it isn’t enough. </p><p>What Americans need, in validation of the secretary of State’s rhetoric, is a visible signal now. Sheinbaum, if she is a good-faith partner, need not risk her regime or her life with an immediate assault on her cartel-partner regime elements — but she can affirm the analysis, and the principles of action that come from it. She can recognize reality and say so. She is fond of proclaiming her dedication to Mexico’s soberania — its sovereignty — and now she has the opportunity to declare that soberania includes sovereignty from the cartels, its agents and its partners … no matter how high up in government they go.  </p><p>We on the American side need it. We want to trust — but we must verify.  </p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and Commerce Minister Li Chenggang in Madrid last week. They announced a "framework agreement" over TikTok, the Chinese-owned app used by millions of Americans. </p><p>But the story isn’t only about TikTok. It’s also about how America uses TikTok as a lever – and why that lever is more necessary than ever.</p><p>TikTok is an important issue in and of itself: control over data, algorithmic influence, foreign ownership – all of which are critical for national security. In addition, however, TikTok is a tool the U.S. can and should use in ongoing trade engagement, as well as to counter China’s growing leverage in rare earths, critical minerals and semiconductors.</p><p>When I served in President Donald Trump’s first administration ("Trump 45"), the core issues we confronted included a massive trade imbalance, intellectual property theft, cyber-theft and China’s Belt and Road infrastructure expansion. These were predatory practices in trade, tech and finance. Today, in "Trump 47," the battlefront has broadened – but one thing that hasn’t changed is the psychological warfare the Chinese employ any time negotiations are underway.</p><p>I was at the center of one of the most dramatic examples of this during Trump 45… </p><p>After an exhausting month of prep work, I boarded my flight to Beijing in March 2018 with wary optimism. I had worked intensively leading up to this trip, drafting a comprehensive framework document outlining a new trade deal with China, a proposal that would overhaul virtually every aspect of the U.S.-China economic relationship.</p><p>We’d sent the proposal to our Chinese counterparts several days earlier, and now our high-level trade delegation was en route to Beijing to negotiate the largest change to trade relations in at least 10 years. The cast of characters illustrates just how significant this trade deal could be. It included Secretary Steven Mnuchin (head of the delegation), Under Secretary David Malpass and me (Treasury), Secretary Wilbur Ross (Commerce), U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and several of his deputies, NEC Director Larry Kudlow, Under Secretary Ted McKinney (Agriculture), and Peter Navarro (special assistant to the president and director of trade and manufacturing policy).</p><p>We arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing with about an hour to review our plans one more time before we had to depart for Diaoyutai – the state guest house where Mao and every leader since has entertained foreign dignitaries. But there was a surprise waiting for us at our embassy:a brand-new proposal, drafted by the Chinese, which they were putting forth at the eleventh hour, and which we had never seen. It was about 15 pages long – and completely in Chinese!</p><p>I was one of the few people in the room who could read it. After a quick scan, I told the group: "This is wholly unacceptable. This document doesn’t say anything – they’re just messing with us." A heated debate ensued over how to respond, and how the Chinese were likely to react. But there was no time to reach a consensus; it was time to leave for Diaoyutai.</p><p>There was a mass exit from the secure room where we met at the embassy, and, almost like a well-choreographed ballet with a hundred moving parts, we all shuffled to our designated cars. As Secretary Mnuchin stepped into the limousine to take us to the meeting, Malpass insisted that I ride with the secretary and pushed me into the seat next to Mnuchin, saying, "We need to know exactly what this says – can you translate it on the way?"</p><p>As we sped through the streets of Beijing, I sat in the back seat, literally shvitzing as a technical term in Chinese got the better of me, and furiously translated as I read out loud, in English, what the Chinese had dropped in our laps.</p><p>Even as we climbed the stairs into the building and entered the meeting room, none of us was quite sure how Mnuchin was going to handle this hot potato. After Vice Premier Liu He’s flowing stream of diplomatic pleasantries welcoming us to China, the secretary calmly stated in response, "We received your draft. Thanks for sending it over – but we’re going to use our draft for today." It wasn’t the preamble they expected. But it was entirely consistent with the new tone that President Trump had set from the day he took office.</p><p>Today, China has moved from using tariffs and IP theft to controlling choke points – especially in rare earth elements, critical minerals, semiconductors and advanced manufacturing capacity. The numbers are clear indicators of China’s leverage. </p><p>China accounts for about 70 % of global rare earth mining and about 90 % of the world’s rare earth refining and separation capacity. In 2023, China controlled 61 % of global mining of rare earth magnet elements and 92 % of refining capacity for those magnets. </p><p>On semiconductors: while U.S. companies remain strong in chip design and advanced R&amp;D, China’s share of the semiconductor industry’s value-added has surged (from about 8 % in 2001 to over 30 % by 2016), and China is pushing aggressively to become self-sufficient in mature node production.</p><p>These are not passive metrics. They are active levers China already uses in the trade negotiations through export restrictions, licensing controls or by threatening disruptions. For example, in April 2025 China – clearly in response to President Trump’s bold tariff moves – added export licenses and restrictions for seven heavy rare earth elements, including dysprosium, terbium, samarium, plus rare earth magnets—materials critical to EV motors, wind turbines, electronics and defense systems.</p><p>The challenges faced in Trump’s first term have only evolved – not eased. The trade deficit is large, IP and tech theft are growing more dangerous, predatory development finance practices continue and China’s leverage in rare earths, semiconductors and control over supply chains threatens global development and American autonomy.</p><p>TikTok is a headline issue impacting critical issues of data, influence and national security. But it is also an essential lever to counter the new pressure points China is pressing. Madrid and Friday’s Trump–Xi call offer a chance to reshape this broader contest. </p><p>As I demonstrate in "A Seat at the Table," President Trump’s strategy and policies during his first administration allowed us to exert maximum pressure on our counterparts and to stay the course with firm negotiating positions and clear red lines. Last week’s dialogues demonstrate that Trump will continue to insist on substance over symbolism, an approach critical to our national interest. </p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>- The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Wednesday launched a new digital ad campaign spotlighting what it calls President Donald Trump's "ongoing attacks on free speech" following last week's suspension of comedian Jimmy Kimmel from his late-night TV perch.</p><p>The spots, which will target a handful of House Republicans in swing districts who face challenging re-elections in next year's midterms, will run on conservative and independent media, including the podcasts of media superstars Joe Rogan and Ben Shapiro, who are very popular among younger and male audiences.</p><p>The campaign, shared first with Fox News Digital, comes in the wake of ABC's move last week to pull Kimmel's late-night talk show off the air after his remarks about the alleged assassin of Charlie Kirk sparked outrage and a veiled threat from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).</p><p>The suspension of Kimmel sparked outrage among Democrats and progressives, and even some high-profile conservatives, who said the late-night host was being punished for exercising freedom of speech. Many Republicans countered that Kimmel's comments suggesting Kirk's suspected killer was a MAGA member were outrageous and false. </p><p>ABC reinstated Kimmel on Monday and his program returned to air Tuesday night, although the roughly 60 affiliated stations owned by Nextar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group preempted the program.</p><p>"The American people don't support attacks on free speech, which is why Trump is losing support among independent and conservative voters," the DNC argued in a statement. "The Republican base is fracturing, with Republican figures including Megyn Kelly, Ted Cruz, and Ben Shapiro loudly breaking with the administration."</p><p>The DNC ad includes a clip of Trump, during the first week of his second administration, announcing that "on day one I signed an executive order to stop all government censorship."</p><p>The narrator in the spot later charged that "Trump wants to control what you see so he can control what you think." </p><p>The DNC says the campaign, which is backed by a modest five figures, will target the congressional districts of Republican Reps. Rob Wittman of Virginia, Jen Kiggans of Virginia, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, and Tom Kean Jr. of New Jersey.</p><p>"It’s clear Donald Trump only cares about silencing his critics — and now, voters across the country and in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey are going to hear about it," the DNC claimed.</p><p>Trump and many of his top allies, long advocates of free speech, have criticized people who have been critical of Kirk since the conservative activist's assassination earlier this month.</p><p>The president welcomed ABC's decision to initially pull Kimmel off the air indefinitely. And Trump also suggested axing the broadcast licenses of networks who, in his opinion, treat him too negatively.</p><p>DNC Chair Ken Martin, in a statement to Fox News, said, "Donald Trump’s administration has amassed a chilling record of restricting speech, extorting private companies, and dropping the full weight of the government censorship hammer on Americans simply exercising their First Amendment rights. This is no exaggeration, and it’s splintering the coalition that got Trump elected."</p><p>Martin claimed that Trump is "attempting to silence people. It’s un-American, and Democrats won’t stand for it."</p><p>Republicans and conservatives,during the administrations of Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden railed against what they considered were efforts to muzzle free speech, attacking Democrats for pushing "cancel culture."</p><p>Trump and his allies are now defending their latest actions by saying that "consequence culture" is replacing "cancel culture."</p><p><i>Fox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Russian fighter jets recently entered Estonian airspace – a bold incursion that came just nine days after 19 Russian drones swarmed the airspace of fellow NATO member Poland. While the Kremlin has denied any intentional violations of NATO airspace, the evidence suggests that both actions were almost certainly deliberate. </p><p>These provocations appear to have been designed to test NATO for both operational and political weakness, and to tell the world that Vladimir Putin believes he can behave with impunity in Ukraine and beyond. Indeed, all of Putin’s recent feints toward peace have been belied by his actions: He followed up his Alaska summit with President Trump in Alaska with the largest aerial attacks on Ukraine of the past year, and ignored the ceasefire deadline offered by the president. </p><p>As NATO continues its deliberations on a coordinated response to the Polish incident and now Estonia, a unified, decisive and robust rebuke from the entire alliance is of paramount importance. The Western alliance failed to deter Russia in 2014, and again in 2022; with Putin now taking the fight even further into European territory, we cannot afford to show any weakness. </p><p>The U.S. and our European allies must show Putin that his acts of aggression will not stand, and that for every escalation and provocation, the costs to him will only multiply. </p><p>NATO is already taking action to strengthen the defense of its eastern flank – a salutary measure, but just one piece of the puzzle. The proposed withdrawal of U.S. military support in the Baltics would send a disastrous signal to the Kremlin, particularly given the incursion into Estonian airspace. </p><p>Congress and the administration should work together to ensure that the U.S. military presence in the frontline Baltic states remains in place as a key component of NATO’s defensive architecture. America and our allies in Europe should take additional steps to bolster the defensive capabilities of NATO’s eastern frontier, forge ahead with iron-clad security guarantees to Ukraine, and provide Kyiv with the defensive and offensive weapons it needs to put Russia on the back foot. </p><p>We also need to make it clear that Russia has torpedoed any prospects for peace talks for the foreseeable future. President Donald Trump has made a good faith effort to facilitate negotiations, but Putin has made it eminently clear that he has no interest in peace. Continuing to indulge the fiction that he wants what we want – or worse, that there is any kind of equivalence between Russia as the belligerent party, and Ukraine, the victim of Russian aggression – only buys Putin time and leverage. </p><p>Next, as President Trump has made clear, Europe needs to stop buying Russian oil and gas – now. It’s absurd that after more than three years, some European countries are continuing to supply Russia with the revenue it needs to conduct this brutal war on their own continent. What’s more, with President Trump leading America back to energy dominance, Europe will have alternative suppliers to turn to – avoiding price hikes while cutting off precious funding for Putin’s war effort. </p><p>The president is also correct to push for a coordinated campaign of financial pressure on Russia and its enablers. This should include sanctioning the Chinese banks that keep the Kremlin’s war machine moving, imposing crushing tariffs and secondary sanctions on the countries that are keeping the Kremlin afloat through oil, gas, and uranium purchases. Congress should work to pass the bipartisan bill put forward by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., which includes the measures outlined above as well as expanded restrictions on Russian financial entities and transactions and the Russian energy sector. </p><p>President Trump understands that peace can only be secured through strength. It’s why he pushed for Europe to assume greater responsibility for its own security in both his first and second administrations. As the former secretary of state, I know from experience that this insistence wasn’t always welcome – but as we all know, it turned out to be prescient. The president’s willingness to have those difficult conversations with our European allies has resulted in the landmark commitment of 5% GDP defense spending for NATO members – putting the alliance back on track to reestablish deterrence and restore Europe’s territorial integrity. </p><p>America must see that project through. It is critical to Europe’s security, and to America’s core interests, that we get this right – and that can only be done by imposing serious costs on Russia, and by showing Putin that his provocations have only strengthened the NATO alliance. </p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Trump just fired a top federal prosecutor because he failed to bring charges against two despised opponents, New York Attorney General Letitia James and ex-FBI chief James Comey.</p><p>The ouster of Erik Siebert, U.S. attorney for Virginia’s Eastern District — and Trump’s own appointee — came after he couldn’t find sufficient evidence to charge James with mortgage fraud.</p><p>The president blamed the firing on Siebert having been put forward by two Democratic senators – hardly a secret – under the archaic "blue slip" requirement that should be abolished.</p><p>"Yeah, I want him out," Trump said after ABC broke the story. Tish James is "very guilty of something."</p><p>What’s more, "he didn’t quit, I fired him!"</p><p>It’s a blip of a story, compared to Trump and his team naming a special prosecutor to again investigate Russiagate allegations from 2016; dropping corruption charges against New York’s Mayor Eric Adams, and suspending security clearances for the law firm that Robert Mueller left four years ago (later blocked by a judge).</p><p>The larger point is that perhaps we’ve become inured to the serious spectacle of a president not just interfering with the Justice Department but literally dictating who should be charged and who should be protected.</p><p>Trump told Pam Bondi over the weekend, "They impeached me twice, and indicted me (five times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!" </p><p>He said he believes James, Comey and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff are "all guilty as hell" but that nothing is being done.</p><p>As someone who used to roam the halls of the Justice Department — and covered three independent counsels involving Ronald Reagan’s AG, Ed Meese — I am acutely aware of the ethical boundaries. </p><p>After the Watergate scandal, which included Attorney General John Mitchell going to prison, led to reforms, the idea of a wall between the White House and DOJ was further cemented. </p><p>Joe Biden saw any involvement in criminal probes as radioactive, and no evidence of his tampering has surfaced (though he did pardon a bunch of allies, including his son).</p><p>There was a huge uproar back when Bill Clinton had a chance tarmac meeting with his AG, Loretta Lynch, while his wife was under investigation over her private email server. She said they talked about grandchildren and travel. A CBS reporter called the meeting "absolutely shocking." </p><p>But you don’t have to rely on unnamed sources to learn about Trump giving his attorney general marching orders. He broadcasts it, even boasts about it.</p><p>Of course, Trump stretching his executive powers goes well beyond DOJ. There are his funding freezes against universities, dispatching of the National Guard in D.C. and elsewhere, and attempting to fire members of supposedly independent agencies such as the Federal Reserve.</p><p>The escalation against the media has been nothing short of stunning. Trump cheered ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel against the backdrop of FCC Chairman Brendan Carr threatening to take action against its local licenses. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," he said, prompting some conservatives to say he sounded like a mafioso.</p><p>Trump won a $16 million settlement from ABC over George Stephanopoulos saying Trump had been held liable for "rape," not sexual abuse. He also won $16 million from CBS over the biased editing of a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris. </p><p>It just so happens that Nexstar, which preempted Kimmel and owns many CBS affiliates, needs administration approval to take over Tegna, another media conglomerate.</p><p>Trump filed suit against the Wall Street Journal for reporting he’d sent a birthday message to Jeffrey Epstein with a silhouette of a naked woman–and when that surfaced with what closely resembled his signature, continued to deny he had done it.</p><p>And then there is his $15 billion suit against the New York Times, which a judge threw out after just four days for its "inexcusable" breaking of the rules in a filing filled with "vituperation." It’s a strange suit because it wasn’t triggered by any particular story, just a general charge that the Times campaign coverage was illegal, including a Harris endorsement that ran on the front page.</p><p>Even the largest corporations have to spend big bucks to defend such suits, which is sort of the point.</p><p>But nothing is as sensitive and powerful as law enforcement, whose officials can shield allies and prosecute opponents.</p><p>The president’s position is that DOJ was weaponized against him during the Biden administration, and therefore he’s entitled to payback.</p><p>The latest news just broke. The Justice Department was investigating border czar Tom Homan for allegedly offering to help win federal contracts to businessmen — who were actually undercover FBI agents — in exchange for $50,000.</p><p>But as MSNBC reports, Trump’s DOJ dropped the case after he took office.Since the hidden-camera encounter took place before Trump was elected, when Homan was a private citizen, I could argue he was just doing what hundreds of lobbyists do. Except for one nagging detail — Homan took the 50K in cash, in a Cava fast-food bag. No paper trail.</p><p>And yet Pam Bondi’s department gave him a pass.</p><p>Prosecutors in every administration must make difficult judgment calls about whether they have enough evidence to convict, especially against government officials or high-profile figures. </p><p>And next time there’s a Democrat in the White House, what’s to stop that person from playing the same kind of hardball, saying their party was entitled to payback? The cycles could be endless.</p><p>As for now, it would be easier to have confidence in these prosecution decisions if the president wasn’t openly calling the shots. </p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>After a nearly weeklong suspension from ABC, Jimmy Kimmel returned to the air Tuesday with a 30-minute monologue addressing the controversial comments that led to his ouster and accusing the Trump administration of hypocrisy on free speech.</p><p>The late-night host questioned whether it was acceptable for the government to regulate "which podcasts the cellphone companies and Wi-Fi providers are allowed to let you download to make sure they serve the public interest."</p><p>Kimmel said such an idea would have been unfathomable in the United States – a land that prides itself on its long tradition of free speech – even just 10 years ago. </p><p>He took particular aim at FCC Chairman Brendan Carr over comments Carr made last week during an interview on the conservative podcast "The Benny Show," hosted by Benny Johnson.</p><p>Carr told Johnson there were potential "avenues" the FCC could take against ABC and Disney after Kimmel suggested that Trump supporters were "desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them." </p><p>Carr alleged that Kimmel was part of a "concerted effort" to mislead the public about the political leanings of Kirk’s suspected assassin, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who FBI officials and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said held a "leftist ideology."</p><p>Carr said broadcasters, whose licenses are granted by the FCC, have an "obligation to operate in the public interest." </p><p>"Look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or, you know, there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead," Carr said. </p><p>Kimmel said Carr telling an American company this would amount to a "direct violation of the First Amendment [and] is not a particularly intelligent threat to make in public." </p><p>"The FCC has a long tradition of meddling where they shouldn’t under many administrations. But it wasn’t always like this," Kimmel said. </p><p>He also highlighted a 2022 tweet from Carr himself, posted while serving as an FCC commissioner under the Biden administration, that read: "Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while using humor to draw more people into the discussion. That’s why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship."</p><p>Kimmel revealed that the commissioner who wrote that tweet was none other than Carr. </p><p>In his monologue, Kimmel clarified that it had not been his intention to "make light" of Kirk’s assassination earlier this month. </p><p>"I don’t think there’s anything funny about it," Kimmel said, choking up. "Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what … was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make." </p><p>Kimmel conceded that his remarks last week may have "felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both." </p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to the FCC for comment. </p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump slammed ABC and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel in a Truth Social post Tuesday night, questioning the network’s decision-making after it opted to keep Kimmel on the air.</p><p>"I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back," Trump wrote. "The White House was told by ABC that his show was canceled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent’ was never there."</p><p>Kimmel’s attempt to criticize reactions to Charlie Kirk’s assassination triggered his suspension.

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>"Jimmy Kimmel Live!" host Jimmy Kimmel insisted that he never intended to make light of Charlie Kirk's assassination in comments that led to his show's suspension.</p><p>Tuesday night was the first show Kimmel hosted since Disney announced its return on Monday after nearly a week off the air.</p><p>Kimmel came out to a standing ovation which continued into chants of "Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!" and ongoing cheering.</p><p>"If you are just joining us, we are preempting your regularly scheduled encore episode of 'Celebrity Family Feud,' we’re bringing you this special report," Kimmel opened. "I’m happy to be here with you tonight." </p><p>He went on to thank his fellow late-night talk show hosts, including Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart and David Letterman, along with right-leaning critics like Clay Travis and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for showing some support for him during his suspension.</p><p>Kimmel then addressed, though did not apologize for, the comments that originally got him suspended.</p><p>"I’ve been hearing a lot about what I need to say and do tonight, and the truth is, I don’t think what I have to say is going to make much of a difference," Kimmel said. "If you like me, you like me. If you don’t, you don’t. I have no illusions about changing anyone’s mind. But I want to make something clear, because it’s important to me as a human, and that is – you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man."</p><p>Kimmel began tearing up as he said he posted a message to Instagram sending love to Kirk's family the day of his death.</p><p>"Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions," he continued. "It was a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make, but I understand that, to some, it felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both, and for those who think I did point a finger, I get why you’re upset. If the situation was reversed, there’s a good chance I would have felt the same way." </p><p>Kimmel added, "I have many friends and family members on the other side who I love and remain close to, even though we don’t agree on politics at all. I don’t think the murderer who shot Charlie Kirk represents anyone. This was a sick person who believed violence was a solution, and it isn’t ever."</p><p>Kimmel also gave his mixed thoughts on Disney suspending his show after 23 years on the air.</p><p>"Every night, they defended my right to poke fun at our leaders and to advocate for subjects that I think are important by allowing me to use their platform, and I'm very grateful for that. With that said, I was not happy when they pulled me off the air on Wednesday," Kimmel said.</p><p>He added, "I did not agree with that decision and I told them that, and we had many conversations. I shared my point of view, they shared theirs. We talked it through. And at the end, even though they didn’t have to, they really didn’t have to, this is a giant company, we have short attention spans, and I am a tiny part of the Disney corporation, they welcomed me back on the air."</p><p>Kimmel closed his monologue by tearfully recounting Erica Kirk's speech at her husband's funeral where she showed forgiveness to his assassin.</p><p>"There was a moment over the weekend, a very beautiful moment. I don’t know if you saw this. On Sunday, Erika Kirk forgave the man who shot her husband. She forgave him. That is an example we should follow. If you believe in the teachings of Jesus, as I do, there it was. That’s it. A selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow. It touched me deeply, and I hope it touches many, and if there’s anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, I hope it can be that," Kimmel said.</p><p>Kimmel’s show was suspended by Disney last Wednesday after he said right-wing commentators were "desperately" trying to characterize Kirk’s alleged assassin as someone who wasn’t "MAGA."</p><p>"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it," Kimmel said on Sept. 15.</p><p>Broadcasting companies Sinclair Broadcasting Group and Nexstar Media Group announced after the episode aired that they would be preempting the show across dozens of ABC affiliates because of Kimmel’s "ill-timed and insensitive" comments. </p><p>Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr also made a veiled threat against the show following backlash from the comments.</p><p>Sinclair and Nexstar preempted Kimmel’s show again Tuesday night and have said they will keep doing so as discussions with ABC continue behind the scenes.</p><p>Ahead of Kimmel's return, President Donald Trump attacked both Kimmel and ABC for bringing the show back despite being told that it was "canceled."</p><p>"I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent’ was never there. Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who’s not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE," Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p><p>He continued, "He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers!

Democrats enjoy a nearly two-to-one voter registration advantage over Republicans in the Hispanic-majority district, which stretches from Yuma to Tucson and includes almost the entire length of the state's border with Mexico.</p><p>Once Grijalva is seated, Republicans will control the House 219-214, with two vacant seats remaining. </p><p>There's a vacancy in Texas 18th Congressional District, a heavily Democrat-dominated district in Houston, following the March death of Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner. The special election to fill the seat will be held on November 4, which is Election Day 2025.</p><p>And Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, a right-leaning seat where Republican Rep. Mark Green stepped down in July to take a job in the private sector, is also currently vacant. The special election to fill the seat will be held on December 2.</p><p>Grijalva, thanks in part to her family name and her support from national progressive rock stars, Sen.

The lede of the now-scrubbed article added, "In a surprise verdict, a federal jury acquitted Ryan Routh of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate last year. The screenshot also indicated that the article would be published in the print edition on September 24, 2025. </p><p>Podcast host and Fox News contributor Mary Katharine Ham posted the screenshot and wrote, "Just searched Ryan Routh's name @nytimes and got this result in the first head and subhead.

As the current version makes clear, Mr. Routh was found guilty on all five counts against him."</p><p>In the interest of being current, there have been numerous high-profile cases where outlets got the outcome of major stories wrong. In 1948, the Chicago Daily Tribune famously ran the incorrect front-page headline "Dewey Defeats Truman." </p><p>"South Park," known for remaining on top of current political and pop culture happenings—sometimes completing shows just hours before they air—had to scrap a prewritten episode and write a new one after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p><p>Routh was accused of an attempted assassination on President Donald Trump at his West Palm Beach golf club in September 2024. Routh faced five federal counts, including attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer, and multiple firearms offenses. The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.  </p><p>After the verdict was read, Routh reportedly tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen before four U.S. Marshals restrained him.</p></body></div></body></html>

As Fry made contact with the pitch, it hit the top of his bat and redirected into his face. </p><p>Fry hit the dirt at home plate in immediate pain, and Skubal threw down his glove and hat in shock.

A cart came out to take Fry off the field, and as you’d expect, his night was over. </p><p>Unfortunately for Fry and the Guardians, because the ball made contact with the bat before hitting him in the face, it was considered a foul ball, and the count went to 2-2. </p><p>Pinch hitter George Valera came in for Fry to finish the at-bat and take his place for the remainder of the game. </p><p>The inning ended up getting worse for Skubal and the Tigers once play finally resumed. His first pitch after the accident was wild, allowing the runner at third base to score to tie the game, while Jose Ramirez moved up to second. </p><p>Then Skubal committed a balk, allowing Ramirez a free bag, a groundout to first base scored Ramirez to give Cleveland a 3-2 lead heading into the seventh inning. </p><p>Skubal is one of the best pitchers in MLB, and the 2024 Cy Young Award winner entered the game with an American League-leading 2.23 ERA over 189.1 innings. His resume this season makes him a frontrunner for the award yet again. </p><p>The game has huge playoff implications because the Guardians were just one game behind the Tigers when they began their final three-game, regular-season series Tuesday night. Each game is crucial at this point, with only a handful of games remaining to determine who will vie for a World Series title this October.</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris called out The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times in her new book, "107 Days," over their refusal to endorse a presidential candidate in 2024. </p><p>"The Los Angeles Times, my hometown newspaper, published its electoral endorsements," she wrote, recalling the Oct. 14 piece published by the paper. "The very first line of the article stated: ‘It’s no exaggeration to say this may be the most consequential election in a generation.’ But there was no mention of the most consequential race of all."</p><p>The LA Times, owned by Patrick Soon-Shiong, declined to endorse a presidential candidate, and The Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, followed suit. </p><p>"The pre-capitulation of these powerful billionaires alarmed and dispirited me. As it turned out, they were early adopters of the feckless posture that would be embraced by a raft of business leaders and institutions once Trump was elected. They’d just been the first in line to grovel," Harris wrote after noting the Post's non-endorsement and in reference to President Donald Trump's eventual election victory. </p><p>Harris's new book was released on Tuesday and recounts her historically short presidential campaign that followed former President Joe Biden's decision to exit the race.</p><p>The LA Times announced in late October the editorial board wouldn’t be endorsing a candidate for the first time since 2008. As a result, the paper’s editorials editor, Mariel Garza, resigned over what she alleges was the owner's decision not to endorse Harris. </p><p>The LA Times told Fox News Digital "an endorsement by the Los Angeles Times is an important decision that can influence a large number of voters. After thoughtful consideration, the owner, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, could not endorse Vice President Harris, based on the record of the Biden administration and her own track record. Competence matters!"</p><p>The Post announced days later that the editorial board would not be endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 election or any future presidential election.</p><p>William Lewis, publisher and CEO of The Washington Post, called the decision at the time "a statement in support of our readers’ ability to make up their own minds on this, the most consequential of American decisions — whom to vote for as the next president."</p><p>The paper has only endorsed Democratic presidential candidates, except in 1988 when it declined to endorse Democrat Michael Dukakis.</p><p>The Washington Post did not immediately return a request for comment.</p><p>USA Today and The Minnesota Star Tribune also declined to endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 election.</p><p>Harris quoted former Washington Post editor Marty Baron's reaction to the paper's non-endorsement in her book, writing, "This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty. Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage."</p><p>Harris also highlighted Alexandra Petri, who now writes for The Atlantic but previously served as a political humor columnist at the Post.</p><p>"But if I were the paper, I would be a little embarrassed that it has fallen to me, the humor columnist, to make our presidential endorsement. I will spare you the suspense: I am endorsing Kamala Harris for president, because I like elections and want to keep having them," Petri wrote at the time.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Chicago Cubs third baseman Matt Shaw is "not concerned at all" about any backlash he could get after skipping a game to attend Charlie Kirk’s memorial in Arizona. </p><p>Shaw missed the Cubs’ 1-0 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday to attend the memorial service in Glendale, though manager Craig Counsell mentioned to the media that Shaw wasn’t available for the game because he was at a funeral for a friend. </p><p>Shaw explained why he made it a point to attend the memorial despite his team’s schedule.</p><p>"My connection with Charlie was through our [Christian] faith," Shaw said before the Cubs opened a new series with the New York Mets Tuesday, per the Chicago Sun-Times. "And that’s something that drives me every day, the reason why I’m able to do what I do every day, and that’s something I’m extremely thankful for. </p><p>"I know without my faith and without the many blessings I’ve been given in my life, that I wouldn’t be here, be able to talk to you guys, able to help this team eventually go and win championships.</p><p>"That’s something I feel really, really blessed about, so whatever backlash comes is OK. I feel strong about my faith and that what was meant to be happened."</p><p>Shaw added that he and Kirk became friends last offseason as they lived in the same apartment complex in Arizona. The two stayed in contact throughout the MLB season, Shaw said. </p><p>Shaw said he was emotional when he found out Kirk was assassinated while at a speaking event at Utah Valley University Sept. 10. </p><p>"When that happened, a lot of emotions came over me," he explained. "I didn’t foresee that happening. I don’t know how to describe everything that happened, how I was feeling, But I will say I was tearing up pretty good. I had a lot of [teammates] supporting me, and that will be something I’ll remember for my entire life."</p><p>Shaw had been scratched from the Cubs’ lineup that night before a game against the Atlanta Braves. </p><p>Kirk, a native of Arlington Heights, a northern suburb of Chicago, was "one of the biggest Cubs fans I ever Met," according to Shaw. In fact, Shaw said it was Erika Kirk, his widow, who asked him to attend the memorial. After a conversation with Counsell and some teammates, Shaw felt his decision to attend was accepted. </p><p>"The reason Charlie and I connected so close was because of our faith," Shaw added. "That’s something that drives me every single day, something that I think about all the time. So, if people are wondering who I am and what I stand for, I’d say that my faith and the many blessings I’ve been given are why I’m able to be here, and I just want to make sure that I can give that back to people, that I can support people around me, that I can love people around me the same way that I’ve been blessed."</p><p>The Cubs were among the MLB teams to pay tribute to Kirk, calling for an end to "all political violence." </p><p>The flag at Wrigley Field was flown at half-staff in accordance with MLB’s request that teams follow President Donald Trump’s presidential proclamation honoring Kirk.</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

He went 24-of-36 through the air for 271 yards with a touchdown pass.

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Comedian Guy Branum claimed he was left with bruises after an alleged altercation with a fellow passenger during a recent flight on Delta Air Lines.</p><p>On Sept. 14, the 49-year-old actor shared a video on Instagram in which he said he was sitting in the middle seat when a man sat down next to him and complained about not having enough space. Branum alleged the man then elbowed him and told him that he was "too fat" to fly.</p><p>"I had an exciting adventure on my plane flight today," the "No Strings Attached" actor began his video, which he labeled "Flying While Fat."</p><p>"Normally when I [have] more money, I'll fly business class because I'm a big guy and I don't want to be in anybody else's space," he continued. "And this time, I got a Comfort Plus ticket." According to Delta’s website, Comfort+ seats are the same width as standard economy but provide more legroom.</p><p>Branum said he often worried about flying since he has had "people freak out at me before."</p><p>"And today, it was a middle seat, not great," he said. "A guy came down, a White man in his sixties.</p><p>"And first, he freaked out at a woman because she was putting something in the overhead compartment near his seat," Branum continued. "Then he sat down next to me, and he immediately was just p----- off at me and asked me if I could move over. And I was like, 'No, I can't.' Then he just elbowed me as hard as he could."</p><p>In the video, Branum displayed an image of bruises on his side that he allegedly sustained after the incident. </p><p>"And then I took this video," he said as the clip cut to another video in which he was seen seated on the plane next to the man.</p><p>"Elbowed me because he believes that I'm too fat to be sitting next to him," Branum claimed to the camera as the man remarked, "Well, who wouldn't believe that?" </p><p>"Would you be happy if I elbowed you back?" Branum asked the man.</p><p>"Well, there's not a lot of room here for me," the man replied. "I paid for this seat too."</p><p>"I paid for this seat as well," Branum pointed out. </p><p>"Think you'd want to at least share the armrest?" the man asked. Branum responded, "Yes, we're not sharing the armrest right now. Right now, you are using the armrest because you elbowed me to get out."</p><p>"I'm not even on the armrest," the man said before Branum told him, "I'm not on the armrest either."</p><p>The two continued to argue as the man appeared to imply that Branum should lose weight. After Branum told the man, "You are hardly svelte yourself," the man said he was a member of WeightWatchers."</p><p>"And that is how I lost the weight," the man told him. </p><p>Branum then asked the man if he expected him to lose weight in the "next 20 minutes or so."</p><p>"No, have you ever," the man said as Branum interjected, "Do you think I have ever tried to lose weight, Sir?" </p><p>"I don't know," the man said.</p><p>"Do you really think that I'm a fat person in this country, and I've never tried to lose weight?" Branum asked.</p><p>"I don't know," the man repeated. </p><p>"OK," Branum said. </p><p>The video cut to Branum as he addressed the camera, explaining that he told a flight attendant that the man had "hit" him but "I was OK to stay in the seat if necessary." </p><p>Branum claimed the man complained to the airline staff that he was "too fat." </p><p>The comedian said multiple Delta staffers came to observe "if I was too fat," including a senior crew member who told the man that Branum would not be removed. Eventually, the man switched seats with a woman across the aisle, and Delta offered her frequent flyer miles for the inconvenience. Branum said he also requested miles.</p><p>Branum noted that the woman who eventually sat next to him was "so nice." However, he went on to say that "fat people shouldn't be waiting for some future moment when we'll be worthy of traveling and living our lives." </p><p>The Emmy Award winner alleged a staff member asked him to delete his video, but he refused. He said other passengers then backed him up, telling staff the man had been difficult with others on the flight.</p><p>He said the woman who eventually sat beside him was "so nice," but added that "fat people shouldn’t be waiting for some future moment when we’ll be worthy of traveling and living our lives."</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Delta Air Lines for comment.</p><p>In an interview with TMZ on Saturday, Branum said he plans to file a police report and a civil lawsuit against the man. "You can’t hit somebody because you think they’re fat," he told the outlet.</p><p>Branum also alleged that the man was not removed from the flight because of his status as a frequent flyer. He told TMZ he has been in contact with Delta representatives about the issue.</p><p>Fox News Digital has also reached out to representatives for Branum for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former San Jose State University women's volleyball assistant coach Melissa Batie-Smoose has filed a lawsuit against the Board of Trustees of the California State University (CSU) system. SJSU is one of 23 California-based schools that are part of the CSU system. </p><p>Batie-Smoose's contract was not renewed when it expired in February, after being suspended from the team in the middle of the season for filing a Title IX complaint over the program's handling of a transgender athlete on its team and a female player who objected to the trans athlete. </p><p>Now, Batie-Smoose is alleging wrongful termination, claiming she "suffered and continues to suffer lost wages, loss of professional reputation and opportunity, emotional distress, and other damages." </p><p>"Defendant’s actions were willful, intentional, and/or taken with reckless disregard for Plaintiff’s federally protected rights," the lawsuit states. </p><p>"Other coaches who did not oppose the inclusion of a biological male on the women’s volleyball team or who did not advocate for the rights of female athletes, were not subjected to suspension, termination or any discriminatory actions as was Plaintiff." </p><p>A spokesperson from San Jose State University responded to the lawsuit. </p><p>"We are aware of the filing and have no further comment, due to pending litigation," the spokesperson told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Batie-Smoose's Title IX complaint against the school, which she filed at the end of last October, first brought to light allegations that the transgender athlete, Blaire Fleming, conspired with an opposing player to have teammate Brooke Slusser spiked in the face during a game. </p><p>Slusser previously joined a lawsuit against the NCAA and filed another against the Mountain West Conference, citing her experience of being made to share changing spaces and hotel rooms with Fleming without being told Fleming's birth sex. </p><p>Batie-Smoose was then suspended at the start of November, while the allegations against Fleming prompted an investigation by the Mountain West into the situation. </p><p>The Mountain West's investigation determined that sufficient evidence could not be found, however, Fox News Digital later reported that the law firm hired to conduct the investigation, Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher (WFG), is the same firm that is representing the Mountain West against Slusser's lawsuit, which also contain the allegations against Fleming of conspiring to have Slusser harmed, as seen in public records obtained by Fox News Digital.</p><p>Slusser also previously told Fox News Digital that she had a conversation with a teammate who was interviewed as part of WFG's investigation. </p><p>"Based on what I was told, exactly what one of my teammates had seen go on that night — about talking about the scouting report and leaving the net open — was told to those lawyers. So, that should have been sufficient evidence [of the alleged plan by Fleming]," Slusser told Fox News Digital, adding she wants to see the investigation reopened. </p><p>"People are telling you this happened, and it's not second-hand information. She sat there and heard the conversation between Blaire and [former Colorado State volleyball player] Malaya [Jones]. So, to me, just from what I know without even having to dig deep into this investigation, there is sufficient evidence, and they were told sufficient evidence."</p><p>Fox News Digital cannot independently verify that Slusser’s teammate corroborated the allegations against Fleming when speaking to investigators. </p><p>WFG later deleted a Nov. 27 online press release from its website that announced the legal victory to keep Fleming eligible. The page is still viewable via an online archive. Fox News Digital has asked WFG multiple times why the page was deleted but has not gotten a response. </p><p>Meanwhile, Batie-Smoose previously told Fox News Digital what she recalled during the Oct. 3 game against Colorado State in which Fleming was accused of conspiring with opposing player Malaya Jones to have Slusser spiked in the face. </p><p>"Close to the end of that set was when [Fleming] overpassed a serve right on top of the net for Malayla to hit toward Brooke Slusser, and then those two were kind of always doing eye contact and making smirks up to that point. But then, when that happened, they both laughed, and [Fleming] said, ‘Thank you,’ and that's when Blaire blew her a kiss," Batie-Smoose alleged.</p><p>Weeks after her contract was not renewed in February, Batie-Smoose's home in Scotts Valley, California, was vandalized in a shooting.</p><p>Scotts Valley Police Department Captain Scott Garner previously told Fox News Digital that officers determined that the weapon used was a pellet gun, and was investigated as an act of vandalism. The pellet had been recovered by police. Nobody was harmed and no suspect or motive was determined. </p><p>Batie-Smoose said she previously received hostile emails about her stance on Fleming and trans inclusion in women's sports. She also claimed to have had in-person altercations with individuals in Santa Cruz and Scotts Valley who disagreed with her stance. </p><p>"People recognize me in the community and I'm in an area that's speaking out and speaking to fight for women's sports, I'm in an area with some crazies and I definitely believe it was a target on me for speaking out," she said.</p><p>Meanwhile, SJSU is under an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for its handling of the situation involving Fleming and Slusser. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>
