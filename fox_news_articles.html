                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>During World War II, the United States unleashed free market mavericks to solve our hardest industrial challenges and build a war machine that proved to be the engine for the Allies’ victory. This machine served us well through the Cold War, but in the past 30 years, it stalled.</p><p>Today, we face a risk of losing our next major war, not for lack of courage or ingenuity, but because of a broken defense acquisition system riddled with bureaucratic sclerosis.</p><p>Americans constantly read headlines about growing threats and potential conflicts as our adversaries innovate rapidly. Meanwhile, our defense industrial base is tied down by regulations built for a bygone era.</p><p>A 2024 congressional report makes clear America is facing its most serious global threats since the Second World War, and we are woefully unprepared to meet the demands of a great power conflict.</p><p>While China spent two decades growing its military, the United States lost its industrial edge, surrendered risk tolerance and emphasized process over outcomes. The result is a constrained system that produces too little material, too slowly and in decreasing quality.</p><p>Reports suggest the U.S. could exhaust our long-range, anti-ship missile supply in as little as a week of conflict with China. The Pentagon takes almost 12 years to deliver the first version of a new weapons system. Our troops even use decades-old radio systems – what if you used a decades-old cellphone?</p><p>Years of rigid regulations have dwindled our once formidable, agile industrial base into a lumbering bureaucracy that fails to meet the needs of our warfighters and our national security interests.</p><p>Reforming the way we develop, produce and deploy weapons in the 21st century is not an option; it’s an imperative.</p><p>To maintain agility and deterrence, we must supercharge our military industrial base by incentivizing the best private sector actors to invest in defense technology and manufacturing. Let them, not the government, drive the process to innovate, iterate and scale the latest capabilities. We don’t need more companies making dating apps and yoga pants; we need businesses built to secure America’s future.</p><p>Forty years ago, many of America’s greatest companies had healthy defense <i>and</i> commercial divisions which created cross-pollination between commercial and government innovation. Now, they are beholden to a byzantine contracting structure that, throughout the 1990s, boiled our defense industrial base down to a small sect of companies that only contract with the government and deters commercial companies from participating in defense industry initiatives.</p><p>That’s why we support the Dynamic Tech Defense Reform initiative in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to break inertia, overhaul the incentive structure that favors a handful of entrenched contractors, and empower new, innovative entrants into our defense industrial base.</p><p>While the traditional primes are often villainized for their role in the stagnation of our defense acquisition, the truth is they are what the Pentagon has made them.</p><p>Decades of systemic inefficiencies have created the paradigm we see today. The FY 2026 NDAA takes important steps to address these problems.</p><p>First, the NDAA’s "commercial first" model champions speed and agility, requiring Pentagon acquisition officers to prioritize commercial options over costly, bespoke development programs. This can save us years in development and billions in taxpayer dollars.</p><p>Second, by narrowing requirements in contracting to only those required by law, the FY 2026 NDAA opens doors to a multitude of innovative businesses, big and small, who can participate in the defense industrial base. This will save costs and strengthen supply chains by ensuring we aren’t reliant on a pool of subcontractors so small that our most critical components for military equipment have only one, maybe two, suppliers.</p><p>Finally, by reforming how the Department of War values past performance, Congress is ending the tyranny of incumbency at the Pentagon. The War Department currently favors entrenched contractors over newer startups – even those that offer superior solutions. Making this change will level the playing field with a focus on competition and improvement instead of a "don’t rock the boat" mentality.</p><p>These reforms will ensure our defense industrial base is vibrant and able to produce and iterate quickly – a requirement for modern warfare. Take the war between Ukraine and Russia, for example. That conflict consumes thousands of drones, missiles and bombs per month. The U.S. struggles to make that many in a year.</p><p>Quantity has a quality all its own. We must ensure we are able to not just produce weapons and materials quickly, but re-fit, re-tool and redeploy them just as fast.</p><p>The United States simply cannot afford to wait until the next war starts to fix our broken acquisition system. We cannot sacrifice our national security on the altar of bureaucracy.</p><p>The time is now for Congress to reinvigorate our defense industrial base to meet the demands of the 21st century. Let’s get to work.</p><p><i>Katherine Boyle is a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz and co-lead of its American Dynamism practice.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump’s executive order just put a $100,000 fee on new petitions for H-1B temporary workers. The rollout suffered from muddled communication, and the order does not stop the H-1B from being used to replace American workers — but it’s a sorely needed first step.</p><p>Created more than 30 years ago to fill a temporary labor shortage, the H-1B has ballooned beyond its intended scope. It needs to be reformed to put American workers first.</p><p>Explaining how the H-1B went so far off the rails would take a whole report — which is why I’ve written one, coming out soon. Meanwhile, here are some of the problems.  </p><p>H-1Bs allow companies to replace American workers with cheap foreign labor and suppress wages for Americans. Exceptions to the original H-1B annual cap of 65,000 visas each fiscal year have expanded the number far beyond statutory limits.</p><p>First, 20,000 more were set aside for applicants with a master's degree or higher degree. Then, H-1Bs for universities and government research organizations were made cap-exempt. Then DHS allowed the spouses of H-1B holders to work.</p><p>Fraud, nepotism and corruption have long compromised the H-1B process. Outsourcing firms and "body shops" rig the labor market to hire foreign workers over Americans.</p><p>Yet there is no shortage of domestic science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) graduates. Every year, the U.S. produces more graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer science and engineering than the economy demands, and overall, only 28% of workers with a STEM degree actually work in a STEM job.</p><p>There are some high-talent H-1Bs, but as Howard University Political Science Professor Ron Hira says, the typical H-1B recipients "are ordinary skilled workers" who could be supplied domestically.</p><p>Amazon, Intel, Google, Microsoft and many other companies have let American workers go while they continued to hire thousands of H-1Bs. Companies predictably deny any connection between the two phenomena, but laid-off U.S. workers insist otherwise. In 2020, the site White Collar Workers of America ranked the "Misfortune 500" body shops most-abusive of H-1Bs. In some cases, companies even require Americans they are sacking to train their foreign replacements.</p><p>On Sept. 25, Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and Illinois Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin wrote to the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and other large American companies asking for specific information about their hiring of H-1Bs, saying "we find it hard to believe that [you] cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions."</p><p>H-1Bs were supposed to be limited to three years, but holders can renew up to six years. And if an alien can’t get a green card because of the cap (no one country is allowed more than 7% of the annual visas), he can get three-year extensions indefinitely.</p><p>Many of the top employers of H-1B workers are foreign-based outsourcers who hire thousands of low-wage H-1Bs and farm them out to U.S. industry. More than 70% of new H-1B workers are from India, with China a distant second at 11%.</p><p>By going through an outsourcing firm, U.S. companies can pay less and avoid negative publicity when replacing Americans. In 2024, hundreds of subcontractors filed for H-1Bs on behalf of Verizon, Wells Fargo, and Walmart. From 2020 to 2024, Citigroup hired more than 3,000 new H-1B workers via outsourcers, who paid them less than those Citi hired directly.</p><p>Many H-1B subcontractors commit unscrupulous or illegal practices. In 2024, Kishore Dattapuram and Kumar Aswapathi, owners of Nanosemantics in San Jose, California, pled guilty in an H-1B visa case. According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, "In pleading guilty, Dattapuram admitted to working with Aswapathi and Giri to submit fraudulent H-1B applications that falsely represented that foreign workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated end-client companies when, in fact, the jobs did not exist."</p><p>Outsourcing giant Cognizant has successfully petitioned for over 52,000 new H-1B workers since 2009, the highest of any company. In 2024, Cognizant was found liable for intentionally discriminating against more than 2,000 non-Indian employees between 2013 and 2022.</p><p>American workers at Cognizant were twice as likely to be fired or resign than workers on visas, and, "Black employees were let go at a rate 23 times that of Asian workers." According to Bloomberg, "each of the five largest outsourcing companies has either settled, lost or is currently fighting a discrimination lawsuit" within the last four years." Yet they are allowed to continue petitioning for new workers.</p><p>The H-1B salary minimum was set at $60,000 in the 1990s but has not been adjusted for inflation. Employers must attest that they will pay new H-1Bs at least the prevailing wage, but a July 2025 Heritage Foundation report showed most H-1B positions pay below-average salaries.</p><p>Microsoft reportedly pays 82% of its foreign workers less than the market wage. Accounting giant Deloitte paid H-1B workers 10% less than Americans in similar roles. Many universities use their cap-exempt status to recruit foreign workers over their own graduates.</p><p>The most corrupt element in the H-1B pipeline is when they convert to permanent residence. This "PERM process," according to a 2020 Department of Labor report, "relentlessly has employers not complying with the qualifying criteria" — because it is a hoop which they must reluctantly jump through before they can hire their preferred, foreign candidate into a job. </p><p>The law requires PERM jobs to be advertised, but companies try to hide them. They try to minimally advertise open positions while avoiding qualified American applicants.</p><p>In 2021, Facebook (Meta) was fined $4.75 million for intentionally denying qualified U.S. workers a fair opportunity to apply for jobs that it had reserved for H-1Bs. In 2023, Apple paid $25 million for similar discrimination. But these fines are minuscule compared with the profits from bringing in cheap labor.</p><p>In 2025, a group of veteran tech workers set up the site www.jobs.now. They find deliberately obscure job advertisements and post them, advising applicants to file complaints with the Department of Justice if they believe they were unfairly rejected.</p><p>At a time when 6.1% of recent college graduates with computer science majors are unemployed, allowing thousands of foreign workers to compete against them on unfair terms makes no sense.</p><p>Charging new H-1B petitioners $100,000 will be a body blow to body shops. But it will leave open many other side doors to unfair competition. Let’s hope this is the beginning of more reform to put the H-1B back in its box and give Americans first crack at their own labor market.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The author of the beloved and iconic children’s book "Love You Forever" is reportedly considering ending his life through physician-assisted suicide, and pro-life groups are grieving the decision. </p><p>"It is heartbreaking that children’s author Robert Munsch wants to pursue assisted suicide," Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, told Fox News Digital in a statement. </p><p>"His children’s book ‘Love You Forever’ illustrates the kind of care and unconditional love that should be extended to a person in their last days," Tobias added. </p><p>Robert Munsch, 80, has written 85 published books including "Love You Forever," "The Paper Bag Princess," and "Mud Puddle." </p><p>In "Love You Forever," Munsch tells the story of a mother’s unconditional love for her son as he grows. In the final scene, the grown son cradles his aging mother in a rocking chair.</p><p>"The son went to his mother," "Love You Forever" reads. "He picked her up and rocked her back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And he sang this song, ‘I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I’m living, my Mommy you’ll be.’" </p><p>Munsch, who has been diagnosed with dementia and Parkinson’s, was reportedly approved for physician-assisted suicide in Canada. </p><p>He told the New York Times Magazine recently that he hasn’t yet chosen a date to die, but said he would pursue it "when I start having real trouble talking and communicating. Then I'll know."</p><p>Canada legalized physician assisted suicide in 2016, but in 2021 it was modified to include those with serious and chronic physical conditions, including those that are not non-life threatening. </p><p>"True compassion means walking with people through their pain, not abandoning them to a premature death," Tobias told Fox News Digital. "Every life has inherent value, no matter the circumstances, and our society should be investing in excellent palliative care and support systems—not in policies that treat vulnerable people as if their lives are disposable." </p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Munsch for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-title">Trump’s cashless bail reform is a good first step. There are 5 more we need right now</div>
                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Cashless bail is a start. But to truly turn the tide on rising crime in America, President Donald Trump will have to focus on the entire criminal justice system, not just pretrial release. Five key stages must be addressed if he wants to Make America Safe Again: police, prosecutors, the judiciary, corrections and parole and probation.  This won’t be an easy task. But if he uses the same approach he’s taking on bail reform — tying compliance to federal funding — he can force change in jurisdictions that refuse to prioritize public safety. If this is done right, these reforms won’t just make headlines; they can make a lasting difference that protects Americans for generations.  On Aug. 25, 2025, Trump signed the executive order, "Taking Steps to End Cashless Bail to Protect Americans." I applaud him for directing the attorney general to identify states and localities that have eliminated cash bail for crimes that clearly threaten public safety. </p><p> Cashless bail allows defendants to be arrested, appear before a judge and walk free without putting up a dime. There’s no monetary consequence for skipping court. This has fueled a revolving-door justice system in which repeat offenders are back on the streets before the police have even finished their paperwork. Ending this reckless policy is a critical first step — but it’s only the beginning. </p><p>Without well-trained, properly equipped police, arrests don’t stick. Good policing is more than putting handcuffs on a suspect; it’s building a case that can survive in court. As a former prosecutor, I know that meeting the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard is tough enough. But when officers cut corners on evidence collection or fail to secure witnesses, prosecutors are left with cases they can’t win. That means dangerous criminals go free. Training, accountability and resources for police departments are essential if we want convictions, not dismissals. </p><p> Even with strong police work, justice fails when rogue prosecutors refuse to enforce the law. We’ve seen this in cities like Los Angeles under District Attorney George Gascón, where the priority seemed to be freeing offenders rather than protecting the public. Contrast that with Nathan Hochman, who, upon becoming L.A.’s district attorney in 2024, declared: "District attorneys must have only two things as their North Stars: the facts and the law." That’s the kind of prosecutorial mentality Americans deserve: prosecutors who put victims and communities first, not their own ideology. </p><p> Trial judges wield enormous power in determining justice. Yet in many states, appointments and elections have filled benches with judges who care more about politics than public safety. The solution? Mandatory minimums. Legislatures are already realizing that unchecked judicial leniency has swung the pendulum too far. By setting clear sentencing floors for serious crimes, lawmakers can prevent judges from turning criminals loose and ensure real consequences for dangerous behavior. </p><p>Corrections isn’t just about warehousing inmates. It’s about ensuring that prisons, jails and correctional systems don’t become revolving doors. Too often, early-release programs put violent offenders back on the streets long before their time is up. Strong oversight and real consequences inside the corrections system are critical to protecting the public. </p></body></div></body></html>

He will be remembered not only for his career but also for his generosity, leadership, and the lasting friendships he built throughout Eagle Pass and the region.

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers battled each other in an absolute slugfest on Sunday night, and it ended in a 40-40 tie.</p><p>The stakes were already heightened coming into AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, as Micah Parsons was making his return to play his former team. While his impact was felt, it was the offenses that really came to play.</p><p>The last two minutes of regulation underscored that.</p><p>The Cowboys needed to respond to a Packers touchdown. KaVontae Turpin returned a kickoff to near midfield. It only took four plays for Dak Prescott and the Cowboys to find the end zone. Following a 19-yard pass to Jalen Tolbert, he found George Pickens for a 28-yard touchdown.</p><p>Dallas drove 54 yards in 62 seconds to get the go-ahead score.</p><p>Green Bay was quick to get back up the field. Packers quarterback Jordan Love led the team down the field in seven plays to set up a game-tying 53-yard field goal for Brandon McManus.</p><p>In overtime, the Cowboys got the ball first. Prescott found Tolbert coming back to the ball to make an incredible catch on the sideline. Somehow, Tolbert got both of his feet in bounds to set Dallas up in the red zone. The Cowboys couldn’t get into the end zone. Parsons possibly saved a touchdown with a sack of a scrambling Prescott. It was Brandon Aubrey who hit the chip shot to go up 40-37.</p><p>It was Love’s turn to lead the charge. On third down, the Cowboys may have gotten away with a defensive pass interference call. But it didn’t deter Love. The quarterback found Matthew Golden to keep the drive alive.</p><p>The Packers nearly ran out of time to make a final throw to the end zone. But he was left with one second on the clock. McManus came onto the field to kick the game-tying field goal.</p><p>Love was 31-of-43 with 337 passing yards and three touchdown passes. Each of his touchdown passes went to Romeo Doubs. The wide receiver had six catches for 58 yards.</p><p>Josh Jacobs was a menace on the ground. He had two rushing touchdowns to go along with 86 yards on the ground. He had four catches for 71 yards as well.</p><p>The Cowboys showed that they weren’t going to roll over and let the Packers walk all over them in their house. </p><p>First, Dallas picked up a crucial two points when they blocked a Packers extra-point attempt in the second quarter. Markquese Bell returned the ball for the two points.</p><p>Then, the Cowboys took advantage as the Green Bay offense appeared to get complacent toward the end of the first half. Cowboys linebacker James Houston caused Love to fumble. He recovered it and gave Dallas a chance to score before halftime. Prescott then found Pickens in the end zone. Dallas had a 16-13 lead at halftime.</p><p>Pickens had an incredible game for the Cowboys. He had eight catches on 11 targets for 134 yards and two touchdowns.</p><p>Prescott was 31-of-40 for 319 yards and three touchdowns. He was only sacked once.</p><p>Green Bay moved to 2-1-1 with the tie and Dallas became 1-2-1.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-title">What will be Tyler Robinson’s defense strategy? Experts weigh in on accused Charlie Kirk assassin</div>
                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Tyler Robinson's new defense attorney has an uphill battle representing the accused assassin of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, experts say.</p><p>"The goal for his new high-profile defense attorneys in the Tyler Robinson case is going to be keep him off of death row," said Maryland attorney and legal analyst Randolph Rice, who is following the case. "And that's probably their goal right now, or at least that's what they're thinking about."</p><p>One option would be to seek a plea deal that spares Robinson from the potential death penalty, like Bryan Kohberger's defense in the Idaho student murders. That could be months or even years down the line.</p><p>If the case does go to trial, prosecutors will have to prove that Kirk's murder included aggravating factors that warrant execution if the suspect is found guilty.</p><p>"What the defense may be able to argue is to say, this was a single sniper bullet that had a single intended target — and therefore it posed no other danger to anyone else," Rice told Fox News Digital. "And if they can prove that to a jury or they can convince a jury of that, then they won't get the aggravating murder, and therefore they won't have the death penalty on the table."</p><p>Robinson, like all criminal defendants in the U.S., is considered innocent until proven guilty. But prosecutors are expected to unveil a mountain of evidence in court, and the politically charged case is being closely watched around the country.</p><p>Kirk, an outspoken conservative whose organization sought to promote right-of-center thinking on traditionally liberal campuses, was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10. Robinson allegedly told his roommate and romantic partner that he did it because he "had enough of [Kirk's] hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out."</p><p>The partner, who was identified as trans, is cooperating with investigators.</p><p>"Obviously they've got the concern about defending their client, they've got concerns about the media attention, but I also think that they may have concerns about their personal safety," Rice said. "This certainly is a political assassination. It's something that has been in the headlines. There are a lot of individuals who are emotional about this. And certainly people on the left are certainly emotional about it. People on the right are certainly emotional about it. And so there are concerns from the defense team's perspective. About their personal safety and that's something they're going to have to consider throughout this entire trial."</p><p>Authorities say they've recovered messages to his romantic partner and other friends taking responsibility for the shooting. According to a probable cause affidavit, he had "confessed...or implied" guilt to a close family friend. The Washington County Sheriff's Office later said his parents convinced him to surrender peacefully rather than take his own life.</p><p>Police recovered a rifle at the scene that investigators allege had Robinson's DNA on it. They also have surveillance video on the campus and nearby roads and a footprint on the rooftop where a sniper fired the bullet that killed Kirk.</p><p>According to court documents, the suspect used his phone on school grounds at least once, on video. That could provide police with additional evidence. They also identified a suspect vehicle, a gray Dodge Challenger, like the one Robinson drives.</p><p>And as Fox News Digital reported Thursday, an officer guarding the campus perimeter "made contact" with Robinson near where police recovered the suspected murder weapon as he was allegedly texting his roommate about wanting to retrieve it before skipping town, according to law enforcement sources.</p><p>Defending a death penalty case will require Robinson's legal team to hire forensic specialists, mental health evaluators and jury consultants, among other measures, Rice said, but his lawyers may have to fight for funding or risk being "hamstrung" before the case goes to trial.</p><p>Kirk's family may also weigh in before prosecutors decide to offer a plea deal. His widow, Erika Kirk, said during her husband's memorial service Sunday said she has already forgiven Robinson "because it was what Christ did, and it's what Charlie would do."</p><p>Separately, she said she did not want to get involved in the decision to seek capital punishment in an interview with the New York Times.</p><p>"I’ll be honest," she told the paper. "I told our lawyer, I want the government to decide this. I do not want that man’s blood on my ledger. Because when I get to heaven, and Jesus is like: ‘Uh, eye for an eye? Is that how we do it?’ And that keeps me from being in heaven, from being with Charlie?"</p><p>If prosecutors decide to offer a plea deal, it may not look like the recent plea for Bryan Kohberger in the Idaho student murders case, according to Louis Gelormino, a Staten Island defense attorney who is following the case.</p><p>"One of the things that surprised me out there in Kohberger was they didn’t let him allocute to the crimes," he told Fox News Digital. "Usually, when you take a plea, you have to confess to your crimes. I would imagine here, if they do take that off the table and they do get a plea out of him, that he’ll have to allocute and explain his crime in public."</p><p>He said he expects Robinson's team to explore a potential insanity defense, but his alleged escape from Orem and week spent plotting the crime could complicate that argument. He also expects defense attorneys to challenge as much evidence as possible in case prosecutors or police failed to "cross all their Ts and dot all their Is," he said.</p><p>"It’s an incredibly tough case," he added. "I don’t envy the defense attorney at all...They’ve got all the evidence in the world."</p><p>Robinson is accused of shooting Kirk in the neck with a hunting rifle from a rooftop at Utah Valley University while the victim was speaking to students and other attendees at a Turning Point USA-sponsored event.</p><p>Robinson's lead defense counsel, veteran lawyer Kathy Nester, was formally appointed to the case Wednesday.</p><p>In Nester's 30 years of experience, she's defended capital cases in California and Utah, and recent high-profile clients include Kouri Richins, a Utah mother of three accused of killing her husband and then writing a children's book about dealing with grief.</p><p>She did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray's office announced the prosecution's trial team would include six attorneys on Monday.</p><p>They include Gray, who spent 23 years with the state attorney general's office and has appeared before both the U.S. and Utah Supreme Courts; Chad Grunander, who prosecuted Utah's first-ever televised trial and has put cold case and cop killers behind bars; Christopher Ballard, who has argued more than 175 appellate cases; Ryan McBride, last year's Utah Prosecutor of the Year; David Sturgill, a veteran prosecutor who is an adjunct professor at UVU, and Lauren Hunt, whose role in the case against double murder suspect Christopher Poulson garnered recognition from the FBI.</p><p>Robinson is due back in court on Monday for a waiver hearing, which will determine whether the defense forces prosecutors to present probable cause before the case proceeds.</p><p>Declining to waive is a defensive strategy that would give his attorneys access to additional discovery materials and a chance to cross-examine state witnesses early on, Rice said.</p><p>Prosecutors have charged Robinson with seven counts, including aggravated murder, which carries the potential death penalty, felony firearms charges, obstruction of justice, witness tampering and committing violence in the presence of a child.</p><p>He has not yet entered a plea.</p></body></div></body></html>

"Reese Witherspoon lives here too, and she’s one of my best besties."</p><p>Kidman, 58, has lived in Nashville since 2008, and admitted she sees a void in opportunities for Tennessee's capital.</p><p>"I can’t say that we will be bringing ‘Big Little Lies’ here," she said. "That’s all got to go where it is.</p><p>"But in terms of just, you know, there is so much room here for production. The crews are fantastic and the actors, and the people, all of… I feel that it’s taking off and will continue to take off, so off we go."</p><p>She added, "Come on, Tennessee, we’ve got this."

"Incredibly grateful."</p><p>The "Cold Mountain" actress previously admitted she thought about giving up her career to build a life on the farm.</p><p>"When I gave birth to Sunday, I was like, ‘I think I’m pretty much done now,’" Kidman said during the Dec. 15 episode of "CBS Sunday Morning." "I’d moved to Nashville, we were living on a farm, and that’s when my mom actually said, ‘I wouldn’t give up completely. Keep your finger, sort of like, in it.’"</p><p>"And I'm like, ‘No, no. I’m done now. I'm done.'"</p><p>However, Kidman's mom was insistent with her advice.</p><p>"She’s going, ‘Just listen to me. I think keep moving forward. Not saying you have to do it to the level you’ve been doing it, but I wouldn’t give it up completely.’"</p><p>The Oscar Award-winning actress can be found contributing to her community by buying diapers for a school donation drive or visiting a local children's hospital.</p><p>"I like being a part of something not about my work, not about who I am, none of that," Kidman previously said in an interview with Elle magazine. "Just a citizen who’s in the world. And my kids love that, too, when I do that."</p><p>Kidman is a mom to four kids. She shares her two daughters — Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret — with husband Keith Urban. The actress also shares two kids, Bella and Connor, with her ex-husband, Tom Cruise.</p><p>Witherspoon, 49, raised her family in both Hollywood and Nashville. She shares son Deacon and daughter Ava with ex Ryan Phillippe. Witherspoon's divorce from Jim Toth was finalized last year.

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris claimed Jimmy Kimmel was briefly suspended because President Donald Trump "couldn’t take a joke" during a speech Saturday night.</p><p>Harris gave the keynote address at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Phoenix Awards Gala, where the current president was a predominant topic. Although Harris did not mention Trump by name, she repeatedly referenced "the president" and suggested it was his "fragile ego" that was behind the ABC late-night host’s temporary suspension.</p><p>"When a president with a fragile ego couldn’t take the joke and brought down the weight of the federal government to silence the voice of a citizen, folks spoke with their pocketbooks this week, and Jimmy Kimmel is now back on the air," Harris said.</p><p>Kimmel came under fire two weeks ago after he suggested on his show that right-wing critics were hitting "new lows" trying to frame Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin as someone other than a member of the "MAGA gang," despite authorities already confirming the suspect’s leftist ideology.</p><p>"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it," Kimmel said.</p><p>As a result, broadcasting companies Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group preempted the show from its ABC affiliates over what they believed were "ill-timed" and "insensitive" comments. Disney suspended the show shortly afterward, only to bring the show back the following Tuesday.</p><p>Several media commentators and Democratic politicians have similarly blamed Trump for Kimmel’s suspension after Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr issued a veiled threat against the show for his original comments.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment.</p><p>During her speech, Harris also emphasized the importance of winning the 2026 midterm elections to push back on an "unchecked, incompetent, unhinged president."</p><p>"You are the leaders who are up for the fight. You are leaders who have courage," Harris said to the crowd. "You are leaders who speak truth, leaders who know that at a time such as this, it demands one thing for sure: we must fight fire with fire."</p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New York Times correspondent and 1619 Project author Nikole Hannah-Jones called efforts by public figures to mourn and venerate Charlie Kirk after his assassination "unsettling" in an essay Sunday.</p><p>After Kirk was assassinated during a Turning Point USA event on a Utah campus earlier this month, Hannah-Jones accused some Democrats and political centrists of "lining up" to honor someone with "extremist" views. </p><p>"[I]n the wake of Kirk’s death, individuals and institutions across the nation moved not just to condemn his killing and political violence, but to venerate him. It was unsettling to many to see politicians from across the political spectrum speak with reverence about a man who espoused the racist Great Replacement Theory, which argues that white Americans are being systematically replaced by multiculturalism and by brown and Black immigrants," Hannah-Jones wrote.</p><p>She added that Kirk "contended that Black people commit more crime than white people" and that Islam "is not compatible with Western civilization."</p><p>Hannah-Jones also rejected efforts to celebrate Kirk as a champion of free speech, claiming that they would lead to "the mainstreaming of formerly extremist views."</p><p>"As the Trump administration wages the broadest attack on civil rights in a century, and the shared societal values of multiculturalism and tolerance recede, using Kirk’s knack for vigorous argument to excuse the re-emergence of unabashed bigotry in mainstream politics feels both frightening and perilous," Hannah-Jones wrote.</p><p>She argued that praising Kirk’s willingness to peacefully debate and hold discourse with political opponents overlooks the people of the Black and transgender community "directly targeted" by the activist’s rhetoric.</p><p>"At a time when the president of the United States is using his power to go after diversity efforts and engaging in a mass deportation project, some progressives are arguing that people of color, immigrants and members of other marginalized groups who felt dehumanized by Kirk’s commentary, podcasts and debates have to find a way to locate common ground with his followers," Hannah-Jones wrote.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Turning Point USA for comment.</p><p>Several Democratic politicians and media commentators have similarly critiqued Kirk’s rhetoric after his death. Fifty-eight House Democrats voted against a resolution to honor Kirk with Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., saying his legacy belongs "in the dustbin of history."</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Score another victory for President Donald Trump in the high-stakes political battle between Republicans and Democrats over congressional redistricting.</p><p>GOP Gov. Mike Kehoe of Missouri on Sunday signed into law a new congressional map, Missouri First, that is likely to hand Republicans an additional seat in the U.S. House of Representatives ahead of next year's midterms elections.</p><p>Missouri, once considered a swing state that has dramatically shifted to the right over the past decade and a half, is the latest battleground in the congressional redistricting showdown after the passage of new maps in GOP-dominated Texas and a redistricting push by Democrats in heavily blue California. </p><p>"I was proud to officially sign the Missouri First Map into law today ahead of the 2026 midterm election," Kehoe said in a statement. "We believe this map best represents Missourians, and I appreciate the support and efforts of state legislators, our congressional delegation, and President Trump in getting this map to my desk."</p><p>Trump, in a social media statement following passage in the GOP-dominated state legislature, called the new map "FANTASTIC" and said it "will help send an additional MAGA Republican to Congress in the 2026 Midterm Elections."</p><p>The new map targets longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver's Kansas City-area district by shifting it eastward to include rural right-leaning voters. The new map would likely flip Cleaver's seat and give Republicans a 7-1 advantage in the state's House delegation.</p><p>Cleaver has vowed to take legal action if the new map is signed into law by the governor.</p><p>"I want to warn all of us that if you fight fire with fire long enough, all you’re going to have left is ashes," Cleaver said earlier this month as he testified in front of a Missouri Senate committee.</p><p>And pointing to recent public opinion polling, he called the redistricting plan "immensely unpopular."</p><p>And Missouri House Minority Leader Ashley Aune accused Republicans of pushing to "rig our maps and eliminate our representation in Congress."</p><p>Kehoe's announcement teeing up the special session came hours after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed into law a redistricting bill passed by the Republican supermajority in the state legislature that aims to create up to five right-leaning congressional districts at the expense of current Democrat-controlled seats in the reliably red state.</p><p>The efforts in Missouri and Texas are part of a broad effort by the GOP to pad its razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.</p><p>Trump and his political team are aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House, when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.</p><p>Democrats are fighting back against the rare, but not unheard-of mid-decade redistricting.</p><p>State lawmakers in heavily blue California have approved a special ballot proposition this November to obtain voter approval to temporarily sidetrack the state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature.</p><p>The effort in California, which aims to create five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts and counter the shift in Texas, is being spearheaded by two-term Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is seen as a likely 2028 Democratic presidential contender.</p><p>With Democrats currently needing just a three-seat pickup in next year's midterms to win back the House majority, Republicans in Indiana, South Carolina, Florida, Kansas and Nebraska are mulling their own GOP-friendly redistricting plans ahead of the 2026 elections. And right-leaning Ohio is under a court order to draw new maps ahead of the midterms.</p><p>Democrats, as they push back, are looking to New York, Illinois and Maryland in the hopes of creating more left-leaning congressional seats.</p><p>In Illinois and Maryland, where governors J.B. Pritzker and Wes Moore are discussing redistricting, Democrats hope to pick up to three more left-leaning seats.</p><p>And Democrats could pick up a seat in Republican-dominated Utah, where a judge recently ordered the GOP-controlled legislature to draw new maps after ruling that lawmakers four years ago ignored an independent commission approved by voters to prevent partisan gerrymandering. </p><p> </p><p> </p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The state of Oregon filed a lawsuit Sunday to block President Donald Trump’s plan to deploy 200 National Guard troops to Portland.</p><p>The suit was announced by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield within hours of Gov. Tina Kotek receiving a memo from Department of War Secretary Pete Hegseth, in which he authorized the troop deployment for 60 days.</p><p>According to the order seen by Fox News Digital, the federally controlled Oregon National Guard would be stationed in Portland to protect federal property "where protests are occurring or likely to occur."</p><p>Kotek, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, and Rayfield, all Democrats, responded by jointly filing the challenge in federal court, arguing the administration’s move is "unlawful" and unnecessary.</p><p>"Oregon communities are stable, and our local officials have been clear: we have the capacity to manage public safety without federal interference," Rayfield said in a statement. </p><p>On Saturday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he had directed Hegseth to send "all necessary Troops to protect war-ravaged Portland, and any other ICE facilities under siege from attack by Antifa and other domestic terrorists."</p><p>Kotek also said Saturday she had spoken directly with the president before Sunday’s order and had urged him not to send in troops. </p><p>"Our city is a far cry from the war-ravaged community he has posted on social media," Kotek told reporters at a news conference at Tom McCall Waterfront Park.</p><p>"There is no insurrection, there is no threat to national security and there is no need for military troops in our major city," she added.</p><p>Despite those objections, federal agents began arriving in Portland over the weekend, with one clash already reported outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. </p><p>Mayor Wilson condemned the arrival of National Guard troops.</p><p>"We did not ask for them to come. They are here without precedent or purpose," he said.</p><p>Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., urged demonstrators to avoid confrontations with federal agents. "Their goal is to create an engagement that will lead to conflict," he said.</p><p>The lawsuit follows a similar case filed by California in June, after the administration sent troops to Los Angeles.</p><p>"This will only serve to divide us as a nation and community under the guise of caring about public safety," Rayfield said. "The number of necessary troops is zero."</p><p>"As standing policy, the Department does not comment on active litigation. We have no comment on this nor the Oregon ARNG deployment at this time," a Department of War spokesperson told Fox News Digital.</p><p><i>Fox News' Jacqui Heinrich contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>It started with a viral clip of Gordon Ramsay yelling years ago: "What are you?"</p><p>"An idiot sandwich," his contestant replied, her head placed between two slices of bread that Ramsay held up to her ears.</p><p>Now, that phrase has turned into a cookbook from Ramsay with more than 100 sandwich recipes.</p><p>Culinary content producer Owen Han crossed paths with Ramsay during the chef’s "Idiot Sandwich" competition in Las Vegas. The contest played off Ramsay’s now-iconic viral moment, and Han not only took part but actually won the event alongside the celebrity chef.</p><p>Since then, Han has continued to build on that momentum, creating a stream of inventive sandwich recipes that have gone viral on TikTok. His playful, over-the-top creations draw inspiration from Ramsay’s humor as well as his high standards in the kitchen.</p><p>The partnership, born out of a tongue-in-cheek moment, has now translated into culinary success. Han has turned the "idiot sandwich" meme into a launchpad for his own cookbook, "Stacked," and national TV appearances. </p><p>"So today we are making a breakfast club sandwich from [Idiot Sandwich]," Han began during his "Fox &amp; Friends" segment.</p><p>"Traditionally, club sandwiches [are] not typically something you eat for breakfast," he explained. "But when you have it on a croissant and add chili eggs, then it’s definitely good."</p><p>He layered in basil mayo, roasted turkey, but said you can always use deli meat "if you’re an idiot and don’t want to get your own roaster."</p><p>The creator then added crispy prosciutto, tomato with chili flake, a fried egg, and fresh arugula. When Brian Kilmeade complained about the size, joking that sandwiches this large often require a fork, Han offered some playful advice.</p><p>"Just go for it," he laughed. "Squish it down."</p><p>The rising chef credits his background for his style. </p><p>"My mom’s Italian, my dad’s Chinese," he said. "To me, just two great food cultures. Born in Italy and just really blessed with great food all around growing up traveling."</p><p>That mix helped him win the Vegas contest, through a signature sandwich.</p><p>"I call it a not-so-classic cheesesteak," Han said. "I do Beijing beef from the Chinese side and then, for the Italian side, I had malted mozzarella and a little hot Italian peppers as well."</p><p>Back on set, he presented the "Breakfast Club." </p><p>"Look at that cross-section right there," Han said, showing off his creation. </p><p>The Idiot Sandwich cookbook is set to come out Sept. 30.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Rory McIlroy was public enemy No. 1 at Bethpage Black all week.</p><p>The reigning Masters champion was the solo leader in heckles thrown his way at this weekend's Ryder Cup on Long Island. Most were fine, but many crossed the line.</p><p>Whether it was telling him his wife was "a four," asking about Amanda Balionis amid a previously rumored fling (with his wife mere feet away), dropping F-bombs, or constant reminders of the 2024 U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2, McIlroy is sure to be happy that this Ryder Cup is over.</p><p></p><p>McIlroy was stoic and ignored everyone 99.9% of the time. But that 0.01% included him telling fans to "shut the f--- up" on Saturday morning and another instance that afternoon where a fan told him he was "not that good," to which he responded, "I'm very f---ing good."</p><p>"I am. I am really good," McIlroy reiterated to Fox News Digital during Europe's celebration press conference, right after chugging a beer.</p><p>But McIlroy has to stay composed, because an athlete is automatically the bad guy if they respond.</p><p>However, there are times — whether it’s playful banter or someone crossing a line — when McIlroy has no choice.</p><p>"Honestly, I'd say it's just on impulse," McIlroy said. "Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. I'm quite an impulsive character, if you haven't noticed. </p><p>"Sometimes I'll engage and sometimes I'll catch myself and refrain. But I don't really choose when, and it's just sort of sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.</p><p>At the end of the day, McIlroy got the last laugh, as his European squad made good on his bold prediction from two years ago, defeating the Americans 15-13 and becoming the first team to win a road Ryder Cup since 2012.</p><p>But the New York crowd is certainly unlike most, especially in a Ryder Cup.</p><p>Future Ryder Cup venues are set through 2039, which will be played at Hazeltine, where McIlroy had one of the fiercest matchups ever against Patrick Reed. So, the earliest a Ryder Cup can return to the New York metro area is 2043. </p><p>After all he endured, would McIlroy be OK with that?</p><p>"If the result is the same," McIlroy said slyly, "Absolutely."</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The man police identified as the gunman who killed at least four people and injured several others during services at a Michigan Mormon church on Sunday before setting the building on fire is a 40-year-old Marine veteran who served in Iraq.</p><p>Thomas Jacob Sanford was named by authorities as the man who rammed a Chevy Silverado truck into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, before opening fire on the hundreds of worshipers gathered there. </p><p>Sanford then allegedly set the building on fire before being killed by responding officers. Police said they believe Sanford used an accelerant, likely gasoline, to start the fire.</p><p>At a short news conference, authorities confirmed that Sanford, from nearby Burton, Michigan, was the lone suspect.</p><p>Sanford served in the Marines from 2004 to 2008 as an organizational automotive mechanic and vehicle recovery operator, the Marine Corps told Fox News. </p><p>He deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He earned several awards during his four years of service, including the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the National Defense Service Medal.</p><p>He left with the rank of sergeant and his last duty assignment was with the 2d Maintenance Battalion, Combat Logistics Regiment 25, 2d Marine Logistics Group at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. </p><p>Police sources told Fox Detroit that Sanford had a wife and son.</p><p>A GoFundMe page from 2015 raised more than $3,000 for Sanford and his wife’s now-10-year-old son, who was reportedly born with congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), a rare genetic condition in which the pancreas releases too much insulin, the New York Post reported.</p><p>Sunday's shooting began at around 10:30 a.m.</p><p>"He drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church," Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye told reporters of what unfolded. "He then exited his vehicle, firing several rounds at individuals within the church. Ten gunshot victims have been transported to local hospitals at this time, including one who has died."</p><p>Two responding officers confronted Sanford and exchanged gunfire with him, killing him, the chief said. Sanford was armed with what appeared to be a rifle, he added.</p><p>Authorities initially reported that one person had been killed. Hours later, police said a second victim died at a hospital. Later Sunday evening, police said two additional bodies had been recovered from the burned-out church. Authorities said the search for additional victims was still ongoing.</p><p>Sunday's shooting came a day after the death of longtime national LDS Church president Russell M. Nelson, who passed away at 101.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Michael Cohen stunned a MSNBC panel on Saturday after stating that he believed former FBI Director James Comey "likely committed a crime" while reacting to news of the indictment. </p><p>Cohen, who was Trump's personal lawyer for many years, surprised MSNBC panelists Elise Jordan, Ayman Mohyeldin and Molly Jong-Fast by saying, "I believe likely he will be found guilty."</p><p>"Well, that’s interesting," Jordan said as Cohen added, "I believe likely he committed a crime." </p><p>"Wait, what?" Jong-Fast added. </p><p>"I don’t know what that crime is, but there are hundreds of thousands of documents, and the government has each and every one of them, all they need to find is that one," Cohen said. "I’ve been through this system. I know better than anybody what a weaponized DOJ looks like and feels like. It is insurmountable."</p><p>Jordan pressed Cohen on whether he actually broke "the law," as he explained he pleaded guilty in his case. </p><p>Cohen was charged and then pleaded guilty in 2018 to crimes including tax evasion, campaign finance violations, and lying to Congress. Cohen later cooperated with investigations into Trump, publicly testifying against him during Alvin Bragg's hush money trial and becoming a vocal critic.</p><p>Mohyeldin asked Cohen to clarify whether he thought the Department of Justice had been weaponized under Trump. </p><p>Cohen argued the DOJ had been weaponized by the government for as long as it's been around.</p><p>"I think your argument is it was weaponized then, by Comey against Donald Trump. That’s what you’re arguing right now," Jordan said, attempting to clarify Cohen's argument. "And so you think that there will be evidence that will show that in court, and so thus validate Donald Trump’s vendetta against James Comey." </p><p>Cohen agreed and said, "I couldn't have said it better myself."</p><p>Comey was indicted by a grand jury on two counts: alleged false statements within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch and obstruction of congressional proceeding. </p><p>Comey will reportedly turn himself in on Friday and his arraignment is set for 10 a.m. on Oct. 9, in Alexandria Courtroom 600 before District Juge Michael S. Nachmanoff. </p><p>Fox News Digital exclusively reported in July that Comey was under criminal investigation by the FBI. The probe into Comey centered on whether he lied to Congress during his Sept. 30, 2020, testimony about his handling of the original Trump–Russia probe at the FBI, known inside the bureau as "Crossfire Hurricane."</p><p><i>Fox News' Brooke Singman and Greg Wehner contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

He had one interception.</p><p>Ward didn’t beat around the bush in the postgame press conference.</p><p>"If we’re keeping it a buck right now, we a--," he said bluntly. "We’re 0-4. At this point, we got nothing to lose. We dropped a quarter of our f---ing games and we’ve yet to do anything. We have to lock in, especially myself.

"As many of you know, I have been dealing with some health challenges, and my doctors tell me that I must have a few procedures."</p><p>The "Jolene" singer was scheduled to perform in Sin City at the end of the year, with six performances at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace.</p><p>"As I joked with them, it must be time for my 100,000-mile check-up, although it's not the usual trip to see my plastic surgeon," Parton continued.
