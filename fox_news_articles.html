                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris' book and promotion tour have been met with disdain and criticism from fellow Democrats and some members of the media. </p><p>"At a time when people are looking for a vision and leadership... and want to see leaders rise to the level of threat facing the country, it’s pretty crazy she chose to write a gossip book that prioritizes the pettiness of her politics," an advisor to a possible 2028 candidate told Politico. "It’s embarrassing for her, and for all Democrats, considering she was the leader of the party less than a year ago."</p><p>Harris sat down with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on Monday, and ABC's "Good Morning America" and "The View" on Tuesday to discuss her new book, "107 Days," about her short, failed presidential campaign. She was pressed on why she thought she didn't win and on a key interview she did in 2024 where she failed to differentiate herself from former President Joe Biden. </p><p>"Harris’ recent media tour to tout her memoir — ‘107 Days’ — has reminded me of something I think I have long known: She is simply not a very good politician. And she hasn’t gotten much better over her decades in the business," former CNN journalist Chris Cillizza wrote in his Substack.</p><p>In a post to X, Cillizza said Harris’ return to the political world reminded him that she’s not good on her feet, adding, "She speaks in word salads."</p><p>CNN's Kasie Hunt and former Democratic Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel discussed Harris' admission on "The View" that she didn't fully appreciate voters wanted to see a difference between her and Biden. </p><p>"Didn‘t fully appreciate how much of an issue it was? Just the entire ballgame," Hunt said Tuesday, asking Emanuel to react. </p><p>Emanuel said all great presidents have a deep appreciation for politics.</p><p>"To not appreciate that question, given that the people thought at that time that the country was headed — 70% thought it was headed in the wrong direction, they wanted to see a change — is to totally misread where the American people were. And that, I‘m a little shocked at, to be honest," he said. </p><p>Harris told the co-hosts of "The View" she lost to President Donald Trump because she didn't have enough time. </p><p>Emanuel also called out Harris for her reasoning in not picking Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as her running mate. </p><p>The former vice president wrote that Buttigieg was too big of a "risk" as a gay man. </p><p>"We were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man. Part of me wanted to say, ‘Screw it, let’s just do it.’ But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk," she wrote. "And I think Pete also knew that — to our mutual sadness."</p><p>Maddow told Harris her rationale for not picking Buttigieg was "hard to hear," forcing Harris to scramble to explain herself to the MSNBC audience.</p><p>One Democratic strategist told The Hill that Harris' book couldn't have come at a worse time. </p><p>, a California Democratic strategist, told the outlet that excerpts of the book "show pretty clearly that she came out with arms flailing and guns blazing, blaming everyone but herself for her loss."</p><p>"It is a curiously negative and ungracious tome for someone who reportedly thinks she can run again in 2028," he added.  </p><p>"In an era where Democrats need all hands on deck in the fight to protect the country and the Constitution from the lawlessness of the Trump administration, she had a real opportunity to be a critical voice in the resistance," Michael Hardaway, a former senior advisor to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told Politico. "This book seems to be unhelpful and divisive in a way that makes it hard for her to be the face of the party as we look to the future."</p><p>Former Obama advisor David Axelrod criticized the book last week in a statement to Politico.</p><p>"If there’s a political strategy here, it’s a bad one. There’s an awful lot of grievances and finger-pointing that really doesn’t serve a political agenda," he said.</p><p>Harris' office did not immediately return a request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-title">National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims reminds us of 'soft-on-crime' policies' deadly consequences</div>
                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>On Sept. 25, we pause as a nation to honor the National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims. It is a solemn day – a day to reflect on the lives stolen, the families shattered and the communities forever scarred by violent crime. </p><p>But remembrance without action is hollow. If we truly honor victims, we must also face the uncomfortable truth: for too long, policies masquerading as "social justice" advocates have placed criminals above victims, and elections have become quite literally a matter of life and death.</p><p>We warned about this in 2017, when progressive prosecutors funded by George Soros began reshaping justice systems across America under the banner of "reform." They promised fairness. What they delivered was bloodshed. The American people now see the devastating cost of these reckless experiments: families burying loved ones who should still be alive.</p><p>Look no further than Charlotte, North Carolina, when the world witnessed pure horror and the murder of Iryna Zarutska. Or to the tragic murder of Laken Riley, a young nursing student whose promising life was stolen. These names join a long list of victims who paid the price for policies that coddle criminals instead of protecting the innocent.</p><p>We’ve seen the consequences up close. We have worked with grieving families across the country who were robbed not just of their loved ones, but of justice. In New York, we walked alongside Victor Maldonado after the senseless killing of his son, Jonathan. </p><p>Jonathan was a ride-share driver, doing honest work to provide for his family while making sure others returned home safely to theirs. His life was cut short by a repeat drunken driver who had been arrested multiple times, and released again and again under bail reform, even after he tampered with his monitoring device. Despite every warning sign, the system let him walk free – and Jonathan paid with his life just days after New York’s bail reform took effect.</p><p>Jonathan’s story is not unique. It’s part of a disturbing pattern. From coast to coast, families are suffering because politicians chose ideology over safety. They gamble with public security by dismantling accountability, emptying jails and excusing repeat offenders. Every release, every "second chance" given to a predator is another victim waiting to happen.</p><p>Some of the victims and families we work with have been in this fight for over 40 years. Take Barbara Connelly, executive director of Long Island NY Metro Area Parents and Other Survivors of Murdered Victims Outreach support group, for example. </p><p>Barbara became a pioneer in the victims’ rights movement after her 15-year-old son, Jimmy, was murdered. His killer was released not only from prison, but also from parole supervision. Can you imagine? Someone can murder a child in cold blood and then one day walk free, living life as though nothing happened – while a mother like Barbara is left to pick up the pieces. </p><p>Barbara buried her baby and then had to fight for the most basic rights, rights anyone with common sense would assume victims already had. And now, after decades of progress, Barbara finds herself fighting the same fight all over again.</p><p>What makes this moment even sadder is the depraved indifference toward human life that has infected our society. People actually take to the streets to protest for the release of cold-blooded killers like Luigi Mangione. We see crowds rallying not for victims, not for grieving families, but for terrorists, rapists and murderers – even cheering on organizations like Hamas. </p><p>How did we lose our way so badly that evil is celebrated while innocence is forgotten? This moral inversion is tearing at the soul of our nation.</p><p>Now as a nation, we are grieving together once again. We are watching in real time the agony of Erika Kirk after witnessing the assassination of her husband, Charlie Kirk. She is not alone in her grief. Millions of Americans who have followed Charlie’s work feel this loss deeply, because we know it didn’t have to happen. The pain of his family is now a national wound, and it underscores with horrifying clarity the price we all pay when society refuses to take evil seriously.</p><p>President Donald Trump has been one of the few leaders willing to call this crisis what it is: a preventable tragedy caused by failed policies. He has shown a commitment to stopping the bloodshed with the most basic, commonsense principle: lock up the bad guys. Secure communities start with accountability. Justice cannot exist if criminals know they will face no real consequences.</p><p>To Congress, to state legislatures and to every governor in America: victims and survivors are pleading with you. Adopt our agenda built not on ideology, but on the lived experiences of families who have buried their loved ones. We are not speaking from theory – we are speaking from the gravesides of our children, spouses and parents. Survivors of homicide victims know the cost of failure, and we know what must be done.</p><p>I know this pain personally. In 2005, my boyfriend and his best friend were murdered. They did not receive the justice they deserved, and that wound has never healed. Decades later, every time I hear about another senseless murder, another family joining this unwanted fraternity of grief, I am taken back to that cold January of loss and heartbreak. The pain is compounded when I learn that the killer was someone the government chose to release – someone who should have been behind bars.</p><p>That is why this day matters. The National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims must be more than symbolic. It must be a turning point. We owe it to Iryna Zarutska, to Laken Riley, to Jonathan Maldonado, to Barbara Connelly’s Jimmy, to Charlie Kirk, and to every victim whose name has been etched into a headstone too soon. We owe it to their families, who will never be the same.</p><p>It is time to choose victims over criminals. It is time to listen to survivors. It is time to reject the failed social experiments that have turned our cities into danger zones. And it is time for leaders at every level to follow President Trump’s lead and take the commonsense step that could save countless lives: lock up the predators and protect the innocent.</p><p>Because remembrance means nothing if we keep repeating the same mistakes.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Bobby was assigned to guide me around Connecticut this past week. He’s a former police officer who now takes care of guests of my radio station affiliates in the Nutmeg State who don’t know the area. He’s a very smart veteran of the Air Force and police forces. </p><p>When Bobby recognized me as the fellow with whom then-candidate Donald Trump was not altogether happy during the four debates in which 45-47 participated in 2015-2016 when I was among the journalists asking questions, I got from Bobby the question in the headline and spontaneously gave the answer in the subheadline. I had not used that answer before. But it’s wholly true and accurate for me. </p><p>Not surprisingly, the next question after "Yes" was "Why?" To which I responded without much thought: "Because he’s an ‘A-to-B’ guy and we need a lot more of that."</p><p>I don’t care for some of the Trump policies, personnel and decisions over the years, but give standing ovations for others. He’s so much better a choice for the Oval Office than either Secretary Hillary Clinton, former President Joe Biden or former Vice President Kamala Harris. I don’t really have to explain my three votes for him. </p><p>But, when I confess that I’ve grown to "like" him to a stranger, it’s fair for the stranger to ask "Why?" My answer this week is the quick summation I’ll use going forward. </p><p>I don’t think Bobby, or anyone else in casual conversation, wants to hear why the president’s defense rebuild, especially of the U.S. Navy, is absolutely critical to the long-term safety of the country; why Operation Midnight Hammer saved the world from the nightmare of a nuclear Iran; why his demand that "elite" education stop violating the country’s civil rights laws when it comes to admissions and protect its Jewish students on campus is just and necessary; how his appointees to the Supreme Court and lower federal courts saved the Constitution from mauling by ultra-progressives in robes; the One Big Beautiful Bill, a closed border etc. etc. etc. The list of excellent policies is long, as is the list of excellent appointees. I have my list of disagreements about policy and people. It’s much shorter. </p><p>What most people want when they ask about President Trump and if their interest is genuine, as opposed to the bell that is intended to open a fight, is a concise explanation of my votes and my affection for 45-47, one that isn’t wonky or a diversion and my spontaneous answer has improved in my mind the more I think of it. </p><p>When I practiced law, I represented large developers who had enormous projects covering sometimes tens of thousands of acres. Whether individual entrepreneurs like Trump or corporate entities, the decision makers in the world of land development were all "A-to-B" guys and gals. They had a project, time was money and they needed to get from where they were on the "critical path" to the end point of selling homes, commercial office spaces or industrial sites. </p><p>Lawyers were hardly welcome on those journeys, but often necessary and when the obstacle in the way was a federal or state law or regulation having to do with "endangered species," "wetlands," or a few other categories of hurdles to be crossed, the phone would ring. The client didn’t care about my family, my firm, my faith or my health. Could I get their project from point A to B? </p><p>And that is an "A-to-B" guy or gal: A problem solver. President Trump sees problems and he wants to take the most direct path to solve them within the Constitutional order. </p><p>(He always obeys court orders and has often reaffirmed his intent to always do so. Thus talk of dictatorship and authoritarianism is absurd. Those who use such ridiculous descriptions should lose the respect of serious people. If you submit to the law — and boy did the president ever do that throughout the lawfare years in front of courts that are only charitably described as "kangaroo" in some cases — then you are a "rule of law" person, not a dictator or authoritarian.)</p><p>But Trump is direct, always and everywhere. He tells you exactly what he thinks. He changes his mind and then tells you what he thinks now. He identifies what he thinks are solutions and pursues them in linear fashion. If something doesn’t work, he looks for the next best direct line to a solution. He doesn’t stop trying. "A-to-B" again and again. </p><p>There is only one "A," which is where America is right now. There are a host of "Bs," which are all the problems Trump sees bedeviling America in one way or another, from Xi and Putin, to Gaza, to high interest rates, to the need for manufacturing of all sorts to reshore.  </p><p>He is always in the "most direct possible solution" business, until that possible solution becomes impossible. Then he finds the next "B" to pursue in that space. </p><p>I’ve grown to like this approach immensely because it is public. Everybody sees it. Everyone who wants to listen will hear it explained.  </p><p>The president has always been the best interview of my lifetime in broadcast because he answers every question and, if you ask a stupid question, he will tell you that too. Accessibility? There’s never been a president to whom the public had more access. I think he is this way, by the way, because all developers who succeed have to answer questions from the most extraordinary range of people of various levels of talent if they want to get to "B" and see their project completed.</p><p>All successful developers are fundamentally alike. All of them take big swings and have some misses. But the ones who succeed? They are all "A-to-B" people. </p><p>So that’s why I like Trump. I have a priest and a pastor. I don’t need those in a president. I think the Constitution as amended and interpreted is a work of genius that needs respecting and President Trump does, though he’s not shy about having his lawyers test old precedents ("Humphrey’s Executor" or the "Chevron doctrine" come to mind) that may need tossing out by the Supreme Court. He’s full of an energy and resilience that the entire country, even his political enemies, feed off of.</p><p>And he scares our enemies, or at least causes them to hesitate in their malign designs. </p><p>The GOP has a great young bench that Trump has helped build up: Vice President JD Vance, Secretaries Rubio and Heseth, Senators Cotton and Cruz, Representative Stefanik. He gets along with GOP leaders with independent sources of power like Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader Thune and smart governors like Ron DeSantis in Florida and Glenn Youngkin in Virginia. The Democrats are in disarray and plunging off the hard left cliff like lemmings. Trump has seized the political center and is holding it tenaciously with focus on issues of the physical security of the citizenry, the safety of their children and economic growth for everyone. </p><p>He’s an "A-to-B" guy and Americans generally like that.</p><p>Trump is far more "TR" than "RR" or "HW" in temperament, but for this time and the next three years, we very much need an A-to-B guy who will accept losing rounds in the courts. It is sometimes that simple. </p><p><i>Hugh Hewitt is host of "The Hugh Hewitt Show," heard weekday mornings 6am to 9am ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

                <div class="article-title">America’s breaking point: Why 2026 could bury Democrats for a generation</div>
                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>We are at a crossroads. A grieving nation demands answers, yet Democrats stand defiantly with chaos. As the adage reminds us, actions have consequences. The 2026 elections and beyond will be a reckoning for the Democratic Party, already on the wrong side of America. On every major issue, from crime to immigration to cultural disconnect, Democrats' embrace of far-left radicalism is alienating voters and paving the way for another crushing defeat. Public fear of crime continues to surge, yet Democrats deny and dismiss voters’ concerns, cementing their status as a permanent minority party, out of touch, indifferent and forgetful of whom they were elected to serve. Their downfall is evident.</p><p>Very few Democrats have the courage to confront reality, but Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) does. He sees that his party’s denial of America’s concerns is unsustainable and is sounding the alarm to change course. This month he warned that Democrats have "forgotten why we lost" in 2024, urging them to stop demonizing President Donald Trump with reckless comparisons to Hitler and to turn down the temperature by acknowledging the political landscape. Fetterman has frequently criticized Democrats for labeling Trump an autocrat, refusing to learn from electoral defeats and failing to connect with the American people. His message is clear: swing-state voters do not want defunded police, open borders, or culture crusades. They want common sense, safety, security and leaders who respect their values. Yet Democrats refuse to listen to Fetterman, or to the American majority, clinging instead to progressive extremism that prizes activism over governance.</p><p>The denial of the Democratic Party is on full display as Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY), a self-proclaimed moderate, chose extremism. Her recent endorsement of Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor has sparked outrage. Mamdani, a radical socialist, built his entire platform on defunding the police, abolishing ICE and protecting sanctuary cities. He represents exactly what voters reject. Hochul tried to justify her endorsement as politically strategic, but there is nothing strategic about betraying American safety for political expediency. The days of moderation are gone. You are either with America, safety and security — or with radicalism. Hochul chose radicalism. And that choice tells voters everything they need to know about where the Democratic Party stands.</p><p>The consequences are devastating and undeniable. In Dallas, Texas, Chandra Mouli Nagamallaiah, an Indian hotel manager, was brutally beheaded last week by an illegal Cuban immigrant. What do Hochul, Mamdani and their Democratic allies say to his family about sanctuary cities? How do they justify policies that shield criminals while leaving innocent Americans like Chandra vulnerable? Sanctuary for whom? It is a fraud when the cost is American life. And these tragedies are not isolated. Polling shows immigration is a dominant voter priority, with the link to crime fueling overwhelming support for aggressive enforcement. Eighty-one percent of Americans view crime as a major concern and Trump’s tough-on-crime stance continues to gain traction. Yet Democrats ignore the crisis. Safety is not optional — without it, America cannot function as a society.</p><p>As Democrats remain tone-deaf to the cries of the American people, their coalition is collapsing. Fractured by radicalism, the Democratic base is eroding, with working-class Black and Hispanic voters leading the shift. Trump’s 2024 victory was propelled by these voters, where he gained 12 points among Black voters and a 25-point swing with Hispanics — driven by frustration over crime and economic strain tied to unchecked illegal immigration. These are the Americans who suffer most from urban crime and face the economic burden of sanctuary policies that cost taxpayers billions in health care, education and policing — resources desperately needed in unsafe neighborhoods. Sanctuary cities are draining the foundation of the communities Democrats claim to represent. The cultural war is causing further damage. The defund-the-police agenda and its failed execution have fueled rising crime, unsafe schools and alienated parents who demand protection for their children. Democrats’ obsession with equity over enforcement has backfired, deepening inequality in vulnerable neighborhoods.</p><p>If Democrats want to ignore the will of the American people, they should look to history as a warning about their party’s future. In the 1980s, Democrats hemorrhaged voter support over high crime rates because of their soft-on-crime policies. Fearful Americans chose the Republican Party, which championed law and order, stronger policing and tougher penalties to restore public safety. Democrats also lost voters who were discontent with economic stagnation, inflation and cultural weakness. This lost ground let Republicans dominate for a decade. Today, political violence is escalating and amplified by left-wing policies that allow lawlessness and chaos. If Democrats refuse to change course, 2026 will be the defining moment that locks them into minority status for a generation while Republicans stand with Americans who demand safety, order and stability.</p><p>The choice could not be clearer. Forget the politics and address the needs of the American people: deliver safety or face the consequences. Democrats must tone down the rhetoric and prioritize the gold standard — law enforcement, secure borders and common-sense solutions. Their refusal to change course is not an accident, it is a choice. And the 2026 midterms will be the turning point.</p><p> There has never been greater clarity. America faces two paths: stand with law, order and core principles — or stand with chaos and radicalism. Voters are watching. 2026 will be remembered as the year Americans stood up, chose security and began the revival of their future.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Democrats have a huge political opening.</p><p>With President Trump under fire from all directions — including some in his own party — it’s a rare chance for the opposition to put some points on the board.</p><p>And who are the most prominent Dems right now?</p><p>One is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>The other is Zohran Mamdani.</p><p>AOC is uber-liberal, and the New York mayoral candidate is a self-proclaimed democratic socialist.</p><p>Many party office-holders, not to mention media and political analysts, say the Democrats’ biggest problem is having lurched too far to the left. A fixation on pronouns, transgender sports and Palestinian rights. </p><p>Does that sound like where most of America is in the fall of 2025?</p><p>There are plenty of clickbait headlines out there about AOC weighing a presidential race. But what Axios’ Alex Thompson, who had the scoop, actually reported is that she’s considering a White House run or a Senate race, against Chuck Schumer. So not much has changed.</p><p>AOC, now in her fourth term, just barely meets the constitutional requirement that a president be at least 35.</p><p>But there’s no question that she’s a dynamic campaigner, prodigious fundraiser and social media phenomenon, with an aura of authenticity.</p><p>Even Trump told Fox News, "She’s got a little spunk, she’s got a little something." But, he said, "her philosophy is bad for the country. I don’t think that philosophy can come close to winning."</p><p>It’s true that what plays in her Queens-Bronx district doesn’t necessarily play in Peoria. I think she would beat Schumer, an establishment figure who seems to read all his statements, but even in the state there are plenty of conservative regions between the Bronx and Buffalo. </p><p>On the House floor, the congresswoman condemned Charlie Kirk’s murder, but said:</p><p>"We should be clear about who Charlie Kirk was: a man who believed that the Civil Rights Act that granted Black Americans the right to vote was a mistake, who, after the violent attack on Paul Pelosi, claimed that ‘some amazing patriot' should bail out his brutal assailant, and accused Jews of controlling ‘not just the colleges — it’s the nonprofits, it’s the movies, it’s Hollywood, it’s all of it."</p><p>She added: "His rhetoric and beliefs were ignorant, uneducated and sought to disenfranchise millions of Americans." </p><p>So she wouldn’t even vote for a symbolic resolution honoring Kirk, the 31-year-old victim of a targeted assassination. That sort of rhetoric excites her base but isn’t exactly a step toward unity.</p><p>Mamdani, who is very likely to become mayor, has a history of socialist rhetoric that he’s trying to soften without retracting it. The inexperienced assemblyman clung to "Globalize the Intifada" — meaning, wipe out Israel — but now says he can see how it’s misinterpreted and won’t encourage its use. He insists that as mayor he would have Bibi Netanyau arrested if he came to the U.N.  </p><p>And this isn’t ancient history. In 2022, he wrote on his website: "We need to dramatically curtail the power and presence of the N.Y.P.D.," cut the force by 1,300 officers through attrition, and cut police overtime and freeze hiring.</p><p>Why? "A racist police system" aimed at controlling "Black &amp; brown New Yorkers."</p><p>Andrew Cuomo, who has been visiting mosques and churches, has turned much more aggressive, calling Mamdani "a man with no beliefs" and "a hypocritical chameleon desperate for attention and adulation." But, of course, Cuomo was forced to resign as governor. No one remembers that he pledged to drop out of the race unless he was leading Mamdani by September. </p><p>The democratic socialist has a double-digit lead, which is why Gov. Kathy Hochul endorsed him — she saw the train leaving the station. That prompted a swipe by President Trump, who regularly denounces Mamdani — which might not be helpful in New York City — said he’d have to look closely at federal money going to the Apple.</p><p>Trump already intervened in the mayor’s race by dropping an indictment against Mayor Eric Adams, though he failed to lure him out of the race with offers of an administration job.</p><p>AOC initially declined the back the long-shot Mamdani, the New York Times reports, but when he got hot she endorsed him as having the best chance to beat Cuomo.</p><p>The Republicans would like nothing better than to run against Instagram star AOC and Mayor Mamdani as the face of a hyper-liberal party.</p><p>And then there’s Kamala Harris, who’s out peddling her bridge-burning book "107 Days," starting with a Rachel Maddow sit down. I don’t think she could have beaten Trump in 1,000 days. Harris was a terrible candidate — cautious, risk-averse, hiding from the press for a month, unable to separate from Joe Biden.</p><p>I assume she has the self-awareness to realize another run for the White House would damage her further. The book takes shots at Biden ("reckless" to run again), Pete Buttigieg (couldn’t pick a gay guy), Josh Shapiro (wanted too much power), and Tim Walz (blew the veep debate). Some have clapped back, often through surrogates (Biden folks calling her a lousy VP).  </p><p>To bring things full circle, Harris just endorsed Mamdani. But Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries have not, undoubtedly for fear of being tied to whatever he does.</p><p>There are, of course, whole swaths of the country that want nothing to do with socialism or the far left.</p><p>Kamala Harris’ book focuses attention on the past just when the Democrats are desperate to turn the page.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>At Dearborn, Michigan’s first city council meeting since his clash with a local Christian minister went viral after a heated exchange over a controversial honorary street sign naming, Mayor Abdullah Hammoud declined to apologize for his saying the minister was "not welcome here" and that he would "launch a parade" when he left town. </p><p>Ted Barham, the same Christian minister, opened his remarks at Tuesday's meeting by repeating the words that went viral at the previous one on Sept. 9. </p><p>"The mayor, in a way, cursed me, as was seen around the world. And I would like to repeat what I said that day to you, Mr. Mayor: ‘God bless you,’" Barham said.</p><p>Barham said he had no plans to file a lawsuit despite pressure from supporters.</p><p>"People have been saying I should do that all over the world. I have no intention of doing that," Barham said. </p><p>Instead, he urged the council to consider his larger message: "Bless those who curse you… love your haters. And I would say that in regard to Hezbollah as well. I would [say] that in regard to Mr. Siblani and I would [say] to Israel, too. ‘Love your haters.’"</p><p>He then made a new appeal. </p><p>"Would it be possible for you, Mayor Hammoud, in front of the world and council members to join me in saying we would like to put out a Christian call to prayer and a Christian call to faith in all the countries around the world where an Islamic call to prayer goes out?"</p><p>Others took the microphone to press the council more directly.</p><p>Anthony Deegan told the chamber, "We love you with the love of Christ. We want the blessings of God to be in your life… it’s not a matter of us versus them." But he then asked pointedly: "Do you definitively, unequivocally, by name, denounce Hamas and Hezbollah? Or do you support them?"</p><p>Shane Rife of Garden City said he was "shocked" to learn that Hammoud had appeared at a rally where Arab American News publisher Osama Siblani praised Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as a "hero." </p><p>"We have a mayor in the United States who is sharing a platform with somebody, with [a] terrorist!?" Rife asked. "Where is your allegiance? Is your allegiance to the United States or is your allegiance to Hezbollah?"</p><p>Pastor Jeff Davis of Dearborn Evangelical Covenant Church also voiced support for Barham, stressing his long service in the city.</p><p>Nagi Almudhegi, a Yemeni-American engineer and candidate for mayor, also weighed in during an interview with Fox News Digital. </p><p>"The United States of America is built on the principles of freedom of speech and freedom of religion. These two principles are sacrosanct," Almudhegi said. "If I were in Mayor Abdullah Hamoud’s spot at that time, I would have not said anything. The gentleman has a right, as an American citizen, to speak his mind. And he did it in a respectful, calm way. The mayor should have afforded him that opportunity instead of launching into that tirade."</p><p>He warned that Hammoud’s "not welcome here" remark risked fueling a false impression that Christians are not accepted in Dearborn. </p><p>"People would get the impression, or it would feed into the paranoia that is very, very wrong, that Dearborn is a racist place, or there’s no place for Christians. And that is what I’m 100% against," Almudhegi said.</p><p>Almudhegi had previously released an official statement condemning Hammoud’s remarks as "uncalled for, classless, unprofessional and just plain wrong," and voiced support for Barham.</p><p>When Hammoud spoke later in the evening at the meeting, he did not answer the many calls for an apology or the demand for a specific denunciation. Instead, he said, Dearborn "represents the best of America" where "people of all backgrounds, of all faiths, and of all beliefs can live peacefully and respectfully as neighbors."</p><p>"For decades, people have been intent on dividing and disparaging our city," Hammoud said. "Dearborn has never fallen for these divisive attempts. Back then and still now, Dearborn residents from every corner of this city have come together to shun hatred and to root it out of the place that we’re all proud to call home."</p><p>The controversy continues to loom over Dearborn’s November mayoral election, where Hammoud faces Almudhegi. </p><p>With only two names on the ballot, the clash over religious freedom and free speech sparked by Barham’s remarks and the mayor’s response may become the defining issue for voters.</p><p>Hammoud's office did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Vice President JD Vance dismissed former MSNBC host Joy Reid’s fiery tirade against his credentials with a goofy meme on Wednesday.</p><p>Reid, who was fired from MSNBC in February, went viral for comments about Vance during an interview with former CNN anchor Don Lemon. </p><p>After saying that she mourns the way Charlie Kirk died, she went on to criticize his rhetoric about affirmative action and how it applies to women like Reid, former first lady Michelle Obama, former congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Reid argued that affirmative action has been used to empower "mediocre" White men like Vance. </p><p>Reid blasted the empowerment of "White people who are essentially mediocre in scale compared to a Black person," suggesting, "maybe the way that JD Vance got into Yale is because they were tired of just letting in White men from New York, from all the elite schools, and they wanted an Appalachian White. That's how that man got into Yale, I promise you."</p><p>Reid has frequently gone on tirades against White people, White men in particular. She recently described American icon Elvis Presley as a mediocre White man.</p><p>Talking to Lemon, Reid argued diversity initiatives bring in people of all backgrounds, such as "disabled people, military veterans, people who come from Appalachia, White folks who come from Alaska and different places that they don't normally come from."</p><p>She cited herself as a beneficiary of affirmative action and suggested her right-wing critics should be thankful to God for the privilege of knowing who she is.</p><p>"Right-wingers, you have the ability to know who I am when I don't know who most of y'all are, but you know me because affirmative action brought me your way," she said.

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>During one of the first Turning Point USA events since Charlie Kirk’s assassination, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin shared a message of hope and faith, telling students, "All of you are the next Charlie Kirk."</p><p>Addressing a packed auditorium at Virginia Tech University as part of the second "This is The Turning Point Tour" stop since Kirk’s death, Youngkin told students, "You will carry the baton. You will engage. You will change minds. You will be that revival."</p><p>Addressing the future, Youngkin said, "The truth is that the question that has been asked over and over again is, ‘Who will be the next Charlie?’ And as I look out in this room and I see thousands of you, I want to repeat the best answer that I have heard. You will be the next Charlie, all of you."</p><p>Despite Kirk’s murder at a similar event at Utah Valley University, Youngkin said the 31-year-old conservative leader left a "blueprint" to advance the truth in the face of evil.</p><p>"That morning Charlie left us with a blueprint," he said. "That morning, he left us with guidelines to once again benefit from a man who spoke truth. He left us again with something to reflect on our own lives. And therefore, tonight we have an opportunity to reflect, and we have an opportunity to go."</p><p>Recalling Kirk’s staunch Christian faith, Youngkin told the students in the arena, "Each one of you is the light. A light that shines in the corner of the room, a light that shines brightly on evil. A light that chases out darkness that is each and every one of you."</p><p>"A sniper's bullet shot from a gun held by someone with a heart of evil tried to silence truth, tried to silence all of us. But you see, the exact opposite is happening," he said. "There is a revival spreading across this great nation."</p><p>"One of the things that we all loved about Charlie Kirk is he not only spoke truth, but he challenged us. He challenged us to do more than sit on the sidelines. He challenged us to engage, to engage in thoughtful dialog, of course, recognizing we had to do it with respect, but to fully engage. Don't back down from your beliefs."</p><p>Youngkin also praised Kirk’s wife, Erika Kirk, who since his death has taken up the role of Turning Point USA CEO, leading the crowd in a moment of applause for her and saying, "We see that the next leader of Turning Point is the person who knew Charlie the very best, someone who looked into his heart."</p><p>Youngkin's words come as Virginia is in the midst of a highly contentious gubernatorial race between Republican Lieutenant Gov. Winsome Sears and former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger. </p><p>On Monday, more than 2,000 people packed into an auditorium at the University of Minnesota for the first Turning Point USA event in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s assassination. </p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lamented missed opportunities for the Democratic Party in reaching young, male voters in 2024 when pressed Wednesday on how Democrats should move forward.</p><p>"Why have Democrats lost? Not only the working-class White men, but working-class Black men, Latinos, go down the list. Young men, so many others. What’s gone wrong? What do the Democrats need to do moving forward to set things straight?" MSNBC host Joe Scarborough asked Clinton during "Morning Joe."</p><p>Clinton said there were many reasons, but she argued the Republican Party did a better job dominating the social media space.</p><p>Clinton responded, "It probably boils down to candidates on the Democratic side either stopped talking in ways that were going to be understood and appreciated and agreed with by certain constituencies, stopped being effective communicators in modern communications. You know, the Republican Party, I have to say, has done a much better job dominating social media, dominating the podcast ecosystem, getting messages out and aiming, particularly at young men."</p><p>Clinton said the Republican Party's efforts to reach men online and engage with them were successful, crediting Steve Bannon and the GOP's outreach. </p><p>"I think Democrats missed a lot of opportunities on that. There seems to be a concerted effort to try to catch up and repair that," she said. </p><p>The former Democratic presidential candidate also said many people get their news from social media, and Democrats needed to capitalize on the space.</p><p>"If they’re getting their news from 15-second videos, 30-second takes, 3-hour podcasts, where people are just kind of unplugged and saying whatever, then Democrats had better compete in those arenas. And, so, there’s a lot of catch-up work to be done," she said. </p><p>Clinton added that Americans did not feel like they were better off in the last election. </p><p>"They did not feel that, fairly or unfairly, the policies of the Biden administration were helping them, helping their families, and Latino voters felt that, as you say, both Latino men, Black men and others said, ‘OK, well, how bad can it get? I mean, you know, we’re not going to want to continue this. So, we have to try something different,'" Clinton added. </p><p>She went on to criticize President Donald Trump's policies and said, "Reality is going to bite."</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> In the wake of Charlie Kirk's Sept. 10 assassination allegedly at the hands of a left-wing ideologue, a leftist gun club with ties to political violence posted recruiting flyers at Georgetown University with references to Kirk's death. </p><p>"Hey fascist! Catch!" says a red flyer from the John Brown Gun Club posted on Georgetown's campus. </p><p>The phrase is a nod to the same slogan which was allegedly written on a shell casing by Tyler Robinson, who stands accused of murdering Kirk at a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University. </p><p>"The only political group that celebrates when Nazis die," the advertisement says. </p><p>It is adorned with a QR code linking to a page that says, "We're building a community that's done with ceremonial resistance and strongly worded letters. If you want to make a real change in your community, let us know below."Turning Point USA spokesman and Charlie Kirk Show executive producer Andrew Kolvet flagged the flyers in a social media post Wednesday afternoon. </p><p>Shae McInnis, a sophomore at Georgetown University and treasurer of the school's College Republicans Club, found the posters in plain sight on the school's activity board on Wednesday morning. </p><p>"So, obviously I read this immediately as a threat, not only for me but for everyone on this campus," McInnis told Fox News Digital. "Every conservative, everyone who just does not subscribe to the prevailing leftist orthodoxy. This is a direct threat against them. It means that there are students at this campus who want to see conservatives dead rather than engaging with their ideas, rather than facilitating a political discourse." </p><p>"Ever since President Trump won the election in January, we've seen an increase in this rhetoric," he continued. "But really, I think many conservatives noticed a change after Charlie Kirk's assassination. While much of the school was united in condemning this horrible act of political violence, there have been fringe elements on the left on social media that we have seen really defend this, justify this, and that is really unacceptable. </p><p>The Center for Counter Extremism lists the John Brown Gun Club as a "far-left group." </p><p>Members of the organization frequently show up armed at left-wing political events under the guise of protecting protesters from right-wing counter-protesters, and the gun club is tied to recent anti-ICE violence. </p><p>On July 4, a dozen people attacked the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas. </p><p>A criminal complaint filed by the U.S. District Court Northern District of Texas alleges that assailants shot 20 to 30 rounds from an AR-15-style rifle before it jammed, causing it to malfunction. </p><p>Some of the suspects in that case are accused of setting off fireworks and graffiting ICE vehicles with slogans like "ICE Pig" in order to lure unarmed agents into a parking lot. At around the same time, more suspects allegedly opened fire from a nearby tree line, striking a local police officer and injuring him. </p><p>Eleven suspects face federal charges, including three counts of attempted murder of federal agents in addition to three counts of discharging a firearm in relation to a crime of violence.</p><p>One of those suspects is Benjamin Song, a long-time antifa agitator who in 2023 was involved in a skirmish with a right-wing group called the New Columbia Movement during a drag event in Fort Worth. </p><p>A lawsuit filed by the New Columbia Movement says Song was at the event providing security as a member of the John Brown Gun Club's Elm Fork Chapter. He was accused of pepper spraying members of the group, but never charged criminally. </p><p>The club has chapters nationwide, and another member, Willem van Spronsen, was killed by authorities in 2019 when he tried to blow up an ICE detention center by igniting a propane tank and throwing Molotov cocktails at the building. </p><p>"You know, we're totally comfortable with the fact that many people disagree with us, and that's what a university is supposed to do," said McInnis. "It's supposed to sharpen ideas based on what people disagree with. But it's not until I saw this poster early this morning that I ever felt directly threatened. I mean, this poster is directly calling for the death of conservatives on this campus." </p><p>The club is named for militant slave abolitionist John Brown, who in 1856 orchestrated the Pottawatomie Massacre. He and fellow abolitionists dragged five Kansas settlers suspected of having pro-slavery sympathies out of their homes and executed them. </p><p>In October 1859, Brown led a 21-man raid on a federal armory in Harper's Ferry, part of Virginia at the time. His goal was to start a slave uprising, but few slaves joined the fight. A local militia confronted Brown and his men and fought back. Four townspeople, including freed slave Heyward Shepherd, were caught in the crossfire and killed in the skirmish.  </p><p>After 10 of his men were killed, Brown was captured. He was later tried for treason and eventually hanged. </p><p>"Georgetown University has no tolerance for calls for violence or threats to the university," a spokesperson for the school told Fox News Digital. "The flyers have been removed and the university is investigating this incident and working to ensure the safety of our community."</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A lawsuit accuses the University of North Carolina and its board of trustees of illegally hiring head football coach Bill Belichick behind closed doors in December. </p><p>Former UNC Provost Chris Clemens and lawyer David McKenzie filed the lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court, and it alleges Belichick’s hiring is one of many instances in which closed sessions occurred at the public university.</p><p>The lawsuit points to an alleged "pattern and practice" at UNC to conceal "matters of grave public concern behind closed doors." One of those matters includes potential conference realignment.</p><p>Clemens also alleges that he was punished after "leaking closed-session information" to faculty members about a meeting with tenure deferral as the main topic of the lawsuit. </p><p>"As Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost, [Clemens] briefed deans and vice chancellors internally about the Board’s tenure policy posture after a closed session so they could manage faculty expectations," the lawsuit reads. </p><p>"The Board’s subsequent effort to punish him for ‘leaking’ closed-session information only highlights the culture of secrecy at odds with the Open Meetings Law and Public Records Law."</p><p>As for Belichick’s hiring, the lawsuit alleges that "substantive deliberation occurred in secret" on Dec. 12, 2024, in an emergency board meeting. The lawsuit charges that, since Belichick’s "compensation package and entire hiring was already public," there was no need for the closed session. </p><p>"The Board did not present any comparable thirty-year ‘net present cost’ analysis, nor did it invoke long-horizon fiscal restraint to defer that decision for a single UNC employee," the lawsuit states, spelling out Belichick’s compensation for joining the Tar Heels.</p><p>Athletics beyond football were used as examples in the lawsuit, including an alleged November 2023 closed session to discuss a potential UNC’s ACC alignment, comparing it to "potential financial outcomes with SEC or Big Ten membership."</p><p>The lawsuit alleges another conference realignment closed session occurred in May 2024. </p><p>"The Board again used closed session to debate conference realignment strategy and athletics department finances," the lawsuit reads. "There is no statutory exemption that permits closed discussion of institutional affiliations and budget planning.</p><p>"Each episode follows the same pattern: the Board invokes a statutory exemption, enters closed session, then discusses broad policy or budget matters that must be debated publicly. The Board compounds these violations by maintaining inadequate general accounts that prevent public understanding of what transpired."</p><p>McKenzie has a history with litigation against UNC, having come out on top in a lawsuit against the university and its Board of Trustees after the May 2024 conference realignment session. </p><p>A temporary restraining order was granted on May 16, 2024, one day after McKenzie filed the suit, which stopped the board "from going into closed session to discuss UNC Athletics’ financials, budgeting, deficit or ongoing future conference realignment and related strategic planning." </p><p>UNC later settled that lawsuit with McKenzie for $25,000 in July 2024. </p><p>Belichick’s hire included a closed session, which lasted 41 minutes and ultimately led to his hiring as well as the hiring of women’s head soccer coach Damon Nahas. It was a shock to the football world because Belichick had not coached in college over his illustrious career. </p><p>As the lawsuit states, Belichick was hired at a salary of $10 million per season with additional compensation for bringing his sons Steve and Brian Belichick onto his coaching staff. </p><p>The suit says Belichick’s agreement placed the "total exposure well into the tens of millions over five years."</p><p>Belichick’s college coaching debut has been pedestrian to start. He's 2-2 over his first four games. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New Orleans Pelicans star Zion Williamson showed off his weight loss at the team's media day this week after an intense conditioning program over the summer. </p><p>"I really felt a shift in my body," Williamson told reporters. "I haven’t felt like this since college, high school, just where I can walk into a gym, and I feel good."</p><p>He added that the team's executive vice president of basketball operations, Joe Dumars, who was hired in April, would hold the star accountable.</p><p>"He’s going to hold me accountable, and as he holds me accountable, he’s going to give me a lot of responsibility as well, which I’m excited for," Williamson said of Dumar. "I know he’s going to hold me to a really high standard, and if I slip up or anything, I know he’s going to be right there to make sure I get right back on the path."</p><p>Williamson, entering his seventh season with the Pelicans, has maintained a reputation of being one of the NBA's more overweight players since coming into the league as the No. 1 overall pick out of Duke in 2019. He has also been one of the more injured players, missing 268 NBA games due to injury or other reasons over his career from 2019-20 to 2024-25. </p><p>The 6-foot-6 power forward's trainer, Pelicans director of performance Daniel Bove, aimed to address his fluctuating weight and consistent injuries with the conditioning program this summer. </p><p>The program included boxing workouts and drills run on football fields. </p><p>"I really felt a shift in my body," Williamson said of Bove's program. "It feels good to feel good."</p><p>Pelicans coach Willie Green said the team has been encouraged by the regularity of Williamson’s presence at team headquarters this offseason.</p><p>"I saw his work this summer, his attention to his body, his conditioning," Green said.

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Alec Baldwin was missing from week two of "Dancing with the Stars," where his wife Hilaria Baldwin performed with partner Gleb Savchenko after their steamy first week.</p><p>Despite Hilaria and Gleb’s spicy dance during week one, that wasn’t why Alec missed the show. Hilaria told Fox News Digital the real reason for his absence.</p><p>"So, Alec is doing a movie right now. He's doing a movie, he's doing a show, he's been traveling so much. He'll be here next week, but we're juggling. </p><p>"We had a certain plan to be in New York right now and then all of a sudden the universe opened and I was offered this incredible experience. And so I packed up all the kids and in a day. I signed the contract to do ‘Dancing with the Stars’ in between landing and getting our luggage. This has been a really wild whirlwind that I'm so grateful for, and it's imposed some shifting," she said.</p><p>While Alec can’t attend every show, the couple’s seven children have been in the audience.</p><p>"So it means that we're not always going to be together because he had committed to some jobs. But he'll come as much as he can and my kids are here to represent and cheer from the crowd," Hilaria told Fox News Digital.</p><p>During week one of "Dancing with the Stars," Hilaria and Gleb shared an intimate moment in which they came face to face. Alec was seen clapping, but fans instantly pointed out his expression.</p><p>"I’m crying the camera panning over to alec baldwin he does not want to be there," one person wrote on X.</p><p>"Alec Baldwin watching Hilaria and Gleb’s steamy Cha-Cha like 😐 That poker face deserves its own mirrorball trophy 😂," another added.</p><p>Other viewers pointed out how the Baldwins always support each other.</p><p>"Alec Baldwin popping up on DWTS 👀 Hilaria hyping him up as always. Gotta respect the support system," one X user noted.</p><p>"Hilaria Baldwin’s gratitude for Alec and the kids' support on *DWTS* is heartwarming. Family backing makes the spotlight a little less intimidating! 💃❤️," another wrote.</p><p>Although Alec may be absent throughout season 34, Hilaria told Fox News Digital that his support means everything.</p><p>"I mean, I can't do it without all of the support that I have, not just from him but from my entire family and from my friends and from Gleb. I mean the person who is spending the most time with me ever and being patient with me and teaching with me. And so I'm, you know, very grateful of him so much. </p><p>"He supports me a lot and I've supported him through a lot. It's a really cool experience to be the one here on the dance floor and people cheering for us," she said.</p><p>When Hilaria was paired with Savchenko, she told him immediately not to take it easy on her. </p><p>"One of the first things I said to him is, you can't offend me. I've been through enough, you can't offend me. And I know that when he pushes me, and he pushes hard, it's with so much love, and he knows that balance. And so every single time he's like, do it better, do it, do better, I take it. </p><p>"I'm like, alright. It gives me drive to do it. But then at the same time, when he said to me, 'I'm proud of you, you did a good job,' I believe him. So he's really the best teacher, the best coach, the best partner, and we've become very close friends over very few weeks. So I'm very grateful for this whole experience," Hilaria said.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>MSNBC panelists on "Chris Jansing Reports" suggested efforts to "dehumanize" illegal immigrants contributed to a deadly shooting at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas Wednesday.</p><p>At least three people were shot, two of them killed, after a gunman opened fire at the site. The FBI said it is investigating the incident as a "targeted attack" against ICE after uncovering anti-ICE messages written on bullet rounds found near the shooter.</p><p>Jansing asked one of her guests, former ICE assistant chief counsel Veronica Cardenas, about the difficulties ICE agents face today, but Cardenas instead blamed rhetoric used to "dehumanize noncitizens" rather than the dangers ICE agents face.</p><p>"It is very difficult," Cardenas said. "It has been a very divisive environment. And the rhetoric does have to stop. Just yesterday, Homeland Security released a propaganda video on their social website stating or using Nintendo’s Pokémon to ‘catch them all’ and continuing to dehumanize noncitizens.</p><p>"So, how do we fix this?" Jansing asked. "Or at least start to fix this? Because at least both sides say they want to bring down the temperature.</p><p>"The way you fix this is by really ensuring that due process is played out in these arrests, in targeting noncitizens," Cardenas said. "When you read about people being arrested, noncitizens being arrested, it’s already stated illegal. </p><p>"Like, that is something to assume. It’s not allegedly. And, so, creating that where people, noncitizens, are already guilty until proven innocent, gives others this right, this hatred to attack and to justify what they’re doing to noncitizens. And, so, there has to be accountability and responsibility on both sides."</p><p>Jansing turned to MSNBC national security analyst Christopher O’Leary about reports that bullet rounds recovered from the shooter contained anti-ICE messaging. O’Leary similarly argued that the attack stemmed from a "real or perceived grievance" from ICE tactics.</p><p>"We have a decade of intentionally attacking institutions, disinformation, misinformation, conspiracy theories, which led to polarization in society. All of those things have set the conditions for where we are now. And then you throw in the aggressive tactics that ICE has employed and the wearing of masks. That’s where you get political violence coming from," O’Leary said. </p><p>"Political violence doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It’s in response to a real or perceived grievance that somebody has. And they think that this is the best outlet, and that is not justifying it. It’s just where you see these pockets of violence emerge. It’s in response to something."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to MSNBC for comment.</p><p>The MSNBC segment followed a press conference with Joshua Johnson, an acting field office director who criticized the rhetoric targeting ICE agents.</p><p>"The rhetoric has to stop. There are people out there who are seeing what is being placed online, and they’re coming. And they’re doing acts of violence against ICE employees. It’s just got to stop. It’s dangerous, and people are losing their lives," Johnson said.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> Eight federal inmates — once on death row for murders, including the killings of fellow prisoners, gang-related stabbings, and the slayings of two campers — have been transferred to a notorious "supermax" prison in Colorado, the Justice Department told Fox News Digital. The news comes as U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi looks to crack down on the previous administration's sweeping clemency actions.</p><p>The eight former death row inmates were transferred Tuesday to the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado, also known as "ADX," Justice Department officials confirmed. </p><p>They were among the 37 death row inmates whose sentences Biden commuted in late December — prompting criticism and complaints that the record clemency and commutation actions were done as a political "Hail Mary," and without proper vetting.</p><p>More of the death row inmates are expected to be moved to ADX, some within weeks, according to one individual familiar with the matter.</p><p>The 37 death row inmates commuted by Biden are all expected to be moved to the facility by "early next year," the Justice Department source told Fox News Digital.</p><p>The effort comes as Bondi and the Trump administration have sought to reverse some of the Biden administration's efforts on criminal justice reform for certain criminals, and instead moved to prioritize violent crime and cracking down on the nation's worst offenders.</p><p>Though a commutation cannot be fully reversed, Justice Department officials told Fox News Digital, Bondi has prioritized ways to penalize these individuals, in coordination with directives from Trump, and to ensure that the "conditions of confinement" are "consistent with the security risks those inmates present because of their egregious crimes, criminal histories, and all other relevant considerations," according to an earlier DOJ memo. </p><p>The eight inmates sent to ADX this week were each convicted of first-degree murder within federal jurisdiction. </p><p>Many had been convicted of crimes that were especially heinous or violent. One individual was convicted of murdering a married couple who was camping at a campsite in the Ouachita National Forest in July 2003. </p><p>Another was convicted of kidnapping, robbing, and murdering a 51-year-old local bank president by tying him to a concrete block and chain hoist, and tossing him off of a bridge and into a lake. </p><p>Many had also killed prisoners while serving time — a factor that can be used in weighing whether to transfer a convicted felon to a higher-security prison.</p><p>ADX is the only true federal "supermax" prison in the U.S., and its inmates are as notorious as the prison's reputation. Among them are Ramzi Yousef, convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombers; former Sinola Cartel leader Joaquín Guzmán, or "El Chapo"; and Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, the co-founder of al-Qaeda.</p><p>"President Biden’s decision to commute the death sentences of these monsters showed abhorrent disregard for our justice system and total disrespect for victims’ families already suffering through immense loss," Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement to Fox News Digital.</p><p>"After meeting with many of the victims’ families at the Department of Justice and promising to take action on their behalf, eight of these prisoners have been transferred to the Colorado super-max prison ADX. This will ensure that they spend the remainder of their lives in conditions consistent with the egregious crimes they committed," she added.</p><p>Shortly after her confirmation as attorney general, Bondi issued a memo aimed at "restoring a measure of justice" to the victims' families. </p><p>The measures granted by Biden earned more criticism than former President Barack Obama: As Fox News reported at the time, the vast majority of Obama’s clemency actions focused on commuting the sentences of federal inmates who met certain criteria outlined under his administration’s Clemency Initiative.</p><p>Bondi hosted victims' families earlier this year to hear their concerns about the commutations, DOJ said. Some said they had been stunned by the eleventh-hour commutations, and that they not been given a heads-up by the Biden administration.</p><p>In February, Bondi issued a memo to the Bureau of Prisons ordering an evaluation of where these prisoners should be detained.</p></body></div></body></html>

The audience rushed to help resuscitate the attendee, which brought the comedian to tears. </p><p>In the video, Lynch was in the middle of his set when he noticed something was wrong with someone in the crowd. "Oh, hey. Everything okay?" he asked. </p><p>Another audience member quickly replied, "No."</p><p>A person then shouted, "I’m calling 911 right now."</p><p>According to Lynch's caption, the man was identified as Mr. Wende, who went into cardiac arrest during his show. </p><p>Audience members quickly jumped into action, taking turns performing chest compressions and checking his pulse. After several minutes, one person said Wende was "waking up."</p><p>Paramedics eventually arrived and took Wende away for medical treatment. </p><p>"He had no pulse for over 5 minutes when, by a miracle of God and the efforts of people in that room that night, they were able to revive him. I've never seen anything like it," Lynch wrote in the caption of his TikTok. </p><p>After the man was taken to the hospital, Lynch looked distraught in the video and took a second before he addressed the rest of the crowd. He thanked them for helping save the man, which earned applause from the audience.</p><p>"That was incredible, dude. Like, I know we’re here making jokes and doing a bunch of s--- just about the town, but you guys all really just came together in a really cool way, dude. You saved that guy’s life, man," he said.</p><p>Lynch shared a follow-up video to TikTok and further broke down the incident. He said it took him some time to grasp what was happening in the audience, but "people in the crowd had reacted almost immediately."</p><p>While the man was unresponsive, "People in the room with no identity, no ego, nothing other than just coming together to clear a path, men, women, taking turns doing compressions for CPR, monitoring vitals, calling the paramedics, working on him for over 5 minutes.</p><p>"I’m getting emotional because … I’m a comedian, but who cares? I felt as a human being that I got to experience a group of people coming together to revive someone, to give back someone their life," Lynch said.</p><p>"It’s just a crazy world, man. And it’s been a hard week for a lot of people for a lot of reasons, and the fact that I just got to witness a village, basically, of people just working together and understanding the stakes of the situation, being good-natured. I said it last night, and I’ll say it again: It was a beautiful thing to witness because it restored hope for whatever is going on in the crazy of this world."</p><p>Lynch made a trip to the hospital after his show to check on the man and "finish the show" for him. He shared photos of himself beside Wende in a hospital bed. </p><p>"Sitting and laughing with his family for hours in a hospital room was truly the reminder I needed for why comedy is so needed. In a divided world filled with hurt and uncertainty, we overlook how fragile the time is that we even get to be here. It feels like we forget we're all the same underneath… we're all human," he wrote in the TikTok caption. </p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Oklahoma state school superintendent Ryan Walters pledged Tuesday to have a Turning Point USA chapter in every high school to honor the group’s co-founder, Charlie Kirk.</p><p>"I’m excited to announce today that every Oklahoma high school will have a Turning Point USA chapter," Walters said in a video on his X account. "We have seen the outpouring from parents, teachers and students that want to be engaged with the meaningful work going on at Turning Point. They want their young people to be engaged in a process that understands free speech, open engagement, dialogue about American greatness, a dialogue around American values."</p><p>He added, "For far too long, we have seen radical leftists with the teachers unions dominate classrooms and push woke indoctrination on our kids. They fight parents’ rights. They push parents out of the classroom, and they lie to our kids about American history. What we’re going to continue to do is make sure our kids understand American greatness, engage in civic dialogue and have that open discussion. We will continue to do all that we can to make sure Oklahoma students have the best education possible."</p><p>Walters faced some criticism for his announcement, particularly from Democrats.</p><p>"Listening to conservative radio host Chad Alexander. He says this is just another pathetic attempt by Walters to win over Republicans while tanking in the polls. Walters has zero power to enforce it and won’t investigate a thing," Oklahoma Democratic state Rep. Mickey Dollens wrote on X.</p><p>Tulsa Public Schools board member John Croisant, a 2026 Democratic congressional candidate, said in an interview with KGOU that Tulsa Public Schools will not take part in "pushing political organizations within our schools."</p><p>"And he can't make us," Croisant said. "Because that's not a part of accreditation."</p><p>Former DNC spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa spoke out against Walters on CNN.</p><p>"I do not think that we should be forcing ideology on our children, especially in public schools," Hinojosa said Tuesday. "After the shooting of Gabby Giffords, we were not forcing ideology in Arizona about guns. After the Minnesota state legislator was killed and her husband was killed in their home by an anti-abortion activist, we weren’t going into Minnesota schools trying to promote abortion in those schools."</p><p>Walters responded to Hinojosa’s comments on "The Story with Martha MacCallum" Wednesday, calling the criticism "laughable." </p><p>"These are the people that forced ‘Drag Queen Story Hour’ on your kids. They force critical race theory on your kids. They force the most radical woke agenda in the country on your kids. The teachers unions and the Democratic Party did that," Walters said.</p><p>He continued, "Then when students and teachers say ‘we want a Turning Point chapter,’ that we have not seen anything like this before. We are excited and want to take the country back, and we want kids to think freely. We want them to understand American values. The unions and the Democrats cry foul. You have to be kidding me with this. We have never seen a Marxist ideology pushed on this like that party has for the last decade."</p><p>Walters said that his announcement coincided with requests from parents and students for new chapters and that he is working with Turning Point USA on the measure.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Walters and Turning Point USA for comment.</p><p>Since Kirk’s assassination at a Utah campus event two weeks ago, Turning Point USA has received tens of thousands of requests to form new campus chapters. Turning Point USA currently operates 900 official college chapters and approximately 1,200 high school chapters.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New York Mets play-by-play announcer Gary Cohen criticized Chicago Cubs third baseman Matt Shaw for skipping a game Sunday to attend Charlie Kirk’s memorial in Arizona, and New York sports radio hosts ripped into him Wednesday morning.</p><p>WFAN’s Gregg Giannotti, co-host of "Boomer and Gio," blasted Cohen, who took exception to Shaw attending the memorial. Kirk’s wife, Erika, reached out to Shaw personally to attend given their friendship. </p><p>The Cubs, in the middle of a pennant race, lost Sunday’s game 1-0 to the Cincinnati Reds.</p><p>"I, quite frankly, didn’t like his commentary, and I’m not going to now dislike Gary Cohen over it. He’s a great broadcaster. He’s been a part of my life for a long time. I thought it was completely unnecessary," Giannotti said over the airwaves.</p><p>"Gary Cohen’s whole life has been baseball, and baseball’s a very serious thing for him. But Matt Shaw saw his friend get shot and killed, got shot in the neck in front of his family and his wife requested that he be there. And Gary Cohen’s got a problem with that because the Cubs are in a pennant race? Have we lost all touch with reality here?"</p><p>Cohen said he didn’t want to talk "about any of the politics of it," but Giannotti and his co-host, former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason, believe the second that was brought up in his statement made it political.</p><p>"You get into the politics by saying that," Esiason said.</p><p>Cohen also mentioned Shaw’s absence did not fall under MLB’s bereavement policy.</p><p>"Who gives a crap? If he wants to go to that, he can go to that," Giannotti countered. "And don’t be mad at him. Why you’re mad, why you care, I have no idea. But be mad at the Cubs who granted him the ability to go."</p><p>Esiason added, "I saw the interview with [Shaw], and he was talking about how he was friendly with Charlie Kirk because they lived in the same area. There’s a couple of pictures of him and Charlie Kirk together, and if Erika Kirk is reaching out to him, what are you supposed to do?"</p><p>Then, Giannotti posed a question to Cohen.</p><p>"Let’s say we didn’t know who Charlie Kirk was, and Matt Shaw was friends with somebody who got shot in the neck and killed in front of his family. Would Gary Cohen have a problem with that because he doesn’t know the person who got shot and killed in front of his family? Or was it because Charlie Kirk had a political platform that Gary Cohen disagrees with, so now it’s weird a baseball player goes over there?"</p><p>Cohen’s comments came late in the game between the Mets and Cubs Tuesday night while Shaw was up to bat.</p><p>"The thought of leaving your team in the middle of a race for any reason other than a family emergency really strikes me as weird," Cohen said.</p><p>His broadcasting partner, former big league player Todd Zeile, added to Cohen’s sentiment.</p><p>"It’s unusual. I think it’s unprecedented, at least from my experience as a player. And I think it made it a little more unusual that it was not revealed until after it came to issue because he was thought to be in the dugout and maybe available and was not, and that’s how it was revealed," Zeile said.</p><p>Shaw told media members Tuesday night why he made it a point to attend the memorial despite his team’s schedule.</p><p>"My connection with Charlie was through our [Christian] faith," Shaw said before the Cubs opened a new series with the New York Mets on Tuesday, per the Chicago Sun-Times. "And that’s something that drives me every day, the reason why I’m able to do what I do every day. And that’s something I’m extremely thankful for.</p><p>"I know without my faith and without the many blessings I’ve been given in my life, that I wouldn’t be here, be able to talk to you guys, able to help this team eventually go and win championships.</p><p>"That’s something I feel really, really blessed about, so whatever backlash comes is OK. I feel strong about my faith and that what was meant to be happened."</p><p>Kirk, a native of Arlington Heights, a northern suburb of Chicago, was "one of the biggest Cubs fans I ever met," according to Shaw. After a conversation with manager Craig Counsell and some teammates, Shaw felt his decision to attend the memorial was accepted.</p><p>"The reason Charlie and I connected so close was because of our faith," Shaw added. "That’s something that drives me every single day, something that I think about all the time. So, if people are wondering who I am and what I stand for, I’d say that my faith and the many blessings I’ve been given are why I’m able to be here.</p><p>"And I just want to make sure that I can give that back to people, that I can support people around me, that I can love people around me the same way that I’ve been blessed."</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>On Wednesday's episode of "The View," co-host Whoopi Goldberg suggested it may be time to consider invoking the 25th Amendment against President Donald Trump following his address to the United Nations General Assembly Tuesday.</p><p>Discussing Trump's address, Goldberg argued other countries aren't laughing at the United States, they're actually "really concerned for us."</p><p>While criticizing Trump's efforts to resolve the war between Russia and Ukraine, Goldberg said, "He had an opportunity to do so much more than he offered them, and they don’t consider him to be serious anymore, and I’m worried. What is the amendment, the 20—".</p><p>The co-hosts took their guesses at which amendment Goldberg was referencing, making multiple attempts before co-host Sonny Hostin eventually informed them that it was the 25th Amendment.</p><p>"I didn’t know what you meant. You meant when you start questioning someone’s competence and mental acuity," Hostin added.</p><p>"Well, they questioned Biden’s competence," Goldberg quickly shot back. "If Biden had acted like this, I would have said take him and sit him down somewhere, but this was not — this was not presidential, and this was not helpful."</p><p>The 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution defines the process for presidential succession and the transfer of power if the president is unable to perform his or her duties. It can be used when a president dies, resigns or lacks the mental or physical capacity to serve in office.</p><p>In the lead-up to their discussion about the 25th Amendment, Hostin accused the president of lying to the U.N. General Assembly about ending seven wars across the globe in the hopes of winning a Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>This set off a debate among the co-hosts about whether Trump would deserve a Nobel Peace Prize for ending the war between Ukraine and Russia.</p><p>Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin was the outlier of the group, arguing that she welcomes Trump's "about-face" on Ukraine and that he would deserve the award if he is able to achieve peace between the two warring countries.</p><p>Goldberg claimed the frightening aspect of the president's most recent about-face on Ukraine is that it will eventually "lead to another about-face" and that the rest of the world is concerned for America under his leadership.</p><p>"They are worried for us," Hostin concurred. "And I want to say this about Americans. Seventy-six percent of Americans say Trump doesn’t deserve to win the Nobel Peace Prize. … His own country doesn’t think that!"</p><p>Hostin appeared to be citing a recent Washington Post/Ipsos poll. </p></body></div></body></html>
