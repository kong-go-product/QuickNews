<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Country star Raul Malo shared that his battle against stage 4 colon cancer has "taken a turn," revealing he was recently diagnosed with a rare complication of the disease.</p><p>On Wednesday, the 60-year-old Mavericks frontman, who first disclosed his cancer diagnosis in June 2024, announced on social media that he has developed leptomeningeal disease (LMD). According to the Cleveland Clinic, LMD is an incurable condition in which cancer cells spread from an advanced cancer to the cerebrospinal fluid and the membranes around the brain and spinal cord.</p><p>Malo explained in an Instagram post that The Mavericks canceled their remaining 2025 tour dates, except for two December shows, so he can focus on his health.</p><p>"I want to update you all on my health, as things have taken a turn," Malo wrote alongside a video in which he was seen sitting in a chair and playing a guitar.</p><p>"As it goes with cancer, it’s a very unpredictable and indiscriminatory disease," the Grammy Award winner continued. "I’ve developed something called LMD, which stands for 'get this s--- out of my head.' Treatment for this is radiation, which I will start tomorrow."</p><p>"We will probably jump into some chemo, and are even looking at alternative therapies," Malo added. "But it’s time to take your words to heart of resting &amp; recovering, so that’s what I’m going to do."</p><p>While Malo shared that "all shows going forward are canceled," he promised fans The Mavericks will "continue doing cool projects, releasing live recordings, merchandise, Trovador and so forth."</p><p>The Mavericks have been touring with Dwight Yoakam on the country star's Cosmic Roundup &amp; Rodeo Tour but recently canceled or postponed several dates due to Malo's health struggles.</p><p>"I want to thank Dwight Yoakam, his band, and crew for their kindness and understanding this year, and sorry we couldn’t finish the tour the way we planned," Malo wrote.</p><p>However, Malo told fans to "hang on to your tickets" for the band's two shows at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium on Dec. 5 and 6, noting they are "planning something special" and will share details soon.</p><p>The "Dance the Night Away" hitmaker also assured fans he is "in no way alone, or scared."</p><p>"I have an amazing wife and boys, wonderful family, team, road crew, band, friends and fans," he wrote. "I don’t even have enough words to describe the love and support that I’m getting right now."</p><p>"To my friends who have sent me texts and messages, I want you to know that I’ve read them all," he continued. "I can’t return them all, but your love, prayers, and well wishes have not gone unnoticed."</p><p>Malo also reflected on how he plans to approach his cancer battle moving forward and vowed to share more updates.</p><p>"We don’t know what this will look like a couple months from now, but we are going into it like we have with everything else," he said. "Full steam ahead. Fight, recover, rest, repeat."</p><p>"I want to thank you all for your incredible support through all this, and sorry about the cancellations but we have no choice anymore," Malo continued. "Find kindness &amp; empathy out there wherever you can. Humans are alright, even if you don’t believe it from what you see on TV."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Eric Dane's wife Rebecca Gayheart says 'my girls are really suffering' as family faces actor's ALS battle</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Eric Dane's wife, Rebecca Gayheart, shared an update on how their family is coping following the actor's amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diagnosis. </p><p>The 52-year-old "Grey's Anatomy" alum announced in April he was battling ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. During an interview with People magazine published Saturday, Gayheart, 54, explained that she and the couple's two daughters, Billie, 15, and Georgia, 13, were "taking it day by day."</p><p>"We have some professional therapists who are helping us, and we're just trying to have some hope and do it with dignity, grace and love," the "Once Upon A Time in Hollywood" star said. </p><p>"I mean, it's heartbreaking," Gayheart continued. "My girls are really suffering, and we're just trying to get through it. It's a tough time."</p><p>Dane revealed his diagnosis in a statement that he shared with People.</p><p>"I am grateful to have my loving family by my side as we navigate this next chapter," he said. "I kindly ask that you give my family and I privacy during this time."</p><p>Dane and Gayheart began dating in 2003, and tied the knot in October 2004. In 2018, Gayheart filed for divorce from Dane, citing "irreconcilable differences." However, she filed a request to dismiss her divorce petition in March — one month before Dane revealed his diagnosis. </p><p>During her new interview with People, Gayheart admitted that she has struggled with maintaining a positive mindset amid Dane's health struggles. </p><p>"I don't think I'm at a place yet where I can pull out a positive nugget. I'm not there yet," she said. </p><p>Gayheart continued, "I mean, we're definitely dealing with something that has brought us all together, and Eric will always be my family, whether we're married or not, or living in the same house or not, but yeah, we are closer, but we don't like the reason why."</p><p>"It's a horrible disease, and I wish that there was a cure," she added. "I hope they find one soon, because it is just so sad."</p><p>In a June interview with People, Dane became emotional as he shared how Gayheart has supported him during his battle with ALS. </p><p>"I call Rebecca. I talk to her every day," the "Euphoria" star said as he teared up. "We have managed to become better friends and better parents. And she is probably my biggest champion, my most stalwart supporter, and I lean on her."</p><p>Dane has previously shared that he was celebrating his "good" days as he contends with his health challenges.</p><p>"Today I'm doing great," Dane told Fox News Digital in June. "I'm approaching this thing one day at a time, and today's a good day. So, that's a win." </p><p>During a June interview with Diane Sawyer on "Good Morning America," Dane detailed a few of the heartbreaking effects of the neurodegenerative disease, some of which included losing function in his limbs.</p><p>"I have one functioning arm," he said. "My left side is functioning. My right side has completely stopped working. [My left arm] is going. I feel like maybe a couple, a few more months, and I won’t have my left hand either. It's sobering."</p><p>While speaking with Sawyer, Dane explained how he's found hope in Dr. Merit Cudkowicz, the physician who has been leading his care.</p><p>"I'm very hopeful. ... I don't think this is the end of my story," he said. "And whether it is or it isn't, I'm gonna carry that idea with me.</p><p>"That's what I got from Merit when I met her. … There was a sense of hope I didn't get from other doctors that I met with," Dane added.</p><p>Dane said he had spoken previously with an organization that told him his doctors would be "there to ... monitor my decline — and that's not very helpful."</p><p>Cudkowicz said the risk factors behind the disease can include anything from environmental concerns like plastics and bacteria in lakes to sports injuries. </p><p>While the "Countdown" star may have physical setbacks, he refuses to let his diagnosis derail his career. </p><p>"I'm going to ride this till the wheels fall off," he told E! News.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Portland mayor condemns federal intervention, claims videos of anti-ICE riots were from years ago</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Portland Mayor Keith Wilson on Saturday dismissed President Donald Trump’s plan to send federal troops to Oregon's largest city, claiming there is no lawlessness or violence there.</p><p>Trump announced Saturday morning he plans to send troops to Portland at the request of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.</p><p>The president said he directed War Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide "all necessary troops to protect war-ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists," adding he was authorizing full force, if necessary.</p><p>Hours later, Wilson said during a news conference the number of necessary troops is "zero" in Portland, "and any other American city."</p><p>"This is an American city," Wilson said. "We do not need any intervention. This is not a military target."</p><p>The mayor alleged the president would "not find" lawlessness or violence in the city, claiming video footage showing violence in the city was from five years ago was "recycled and then recycled again."</p><p>"If President Trump came to Portland today, what he would find is people riding their bikes, playing sports, enjoying the sunshine, buying groceries or produce from a farmers' market," Wilson said. "We've had hard conversations, and we've done important work in the years since that footage was taken, we reformed our public safety system. We've refocused our community and on our economy, and we've redoubled our efforts to help our most vulnerable."</p><p>Since June, protests have erupted near an ICE facility in Portland, where city officials cited land use violations, including improper detainee holding times and boarded-up windows. </p><p>The building has been vandalized with anti-ICE graffiti and clashes between protesters and federal agents have occasionally turned violent, leading to the use of rubber bullets, tear gas and flash bangs. </p><p>Video obtained by Fox News Digital confirmed another violent protest in August, with footage showing protesters rolling out a guillotine, lighting fires and fighting with authorities — forcing law enforcement to disperse the crowd with munitions.</p><p>Instead of sending troops to protect the federal facility, Wilson suggested the president send "hundreds of engineers, or teachers, or outreach workers" to Portland instead of a "short, expensive and fruitless show of force."</p><p>"I am so deeply disappointed with the federal government's irresponsibility," he said. "At the end of the day, this may be a show of force, but that's all it is. It's a big show, and after the big show, everyone goes home. That's what I want to happen here today in Portland. We have a long and proud tradition of peaceful protest. We have a long and proud track record of being at the forefront of positive social change."</p><p>"There are new risks today, risks that we do not yet fully understand," he continued. "The administration has refused to elaborate on what they mean when they say they will deploy full force against our city and citizens."</p><p>In his announcement on Saturday, Trump did not say he would deploy full force against the city of Portland and its citizens, as Wilson claimed. </p><p>The president said he would send "all necessary troops" to protect the city and its ICE facilities, authorizing full force against domestic terrorism "if necessary."</p><p>Portland, a sanctuary city since 2017, has resisted federal immigration enforcement, making it a focal point during the administration's immigration enforcement initiative.</p><p>In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Wilson, warning the city’s sanctuary policies undermine U.S. interests. She demanded Portland affirm compliance with federal law and end practices that obstruct immigration enforcement.</p><p>The City of Portland did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Granger Smith's wife shares details of his near-suicide attempt following son's drowning</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Granger Smith's wife, Amber Smith, is opening up about a devastating chapter in their lives. </p><p>The 46-year-old former country star and 42-year-old actress suffered a tragedy in 2019 when their 3-year-old son River drowned in the pool outside their Texas home.</p><p>Granger previously revealed in his 2023 memoir "Like a River" that he almost took his own life after reaching one of his lowest points following the loss of his son.  </p><p>In her forthcoming memoir "The Girl on the Bathroom Floor," Amber recounted the harrowing night of Granger's near-suicide attempt from her perspective, detailing how her husband "put a cold Glock 9mm into his mouth." She also said that he told her years later how close he was to pulling the trigger.</p><p>"He was out with the guys in Boise, Idaho, one night after a show," Amber began in an excerpt of the book published by People magazine on Thursday.</p><p>"They walked over to the local bar, laughed, and told old stories, all while drinking more than he had since River died," she continued. "When the evening wrapped up, he found himself drunkenly walking back to his tour bus alone."</p><p>Amber wrote that when Granger returned, he struggled to get onto the tour bus as he couldn’t recall the door code – a set of numbers he had pressed hundreds of times.</p><p>Once inside the bus, Granger "realized the severity of the situation" because he "hadn't been drunk in a really long time."</p><p>"Fearing that this would cause all the emotions and pain to come flooding back, he quickly grabbed for the weed pen and took a hit, hoping it would bring him out of his drunken state a bit, but nothing changed," Amber wrote.</p><p>Amber described how her husband became overwhelmed by the "slideshow" of tormenting mental images of their son's final moments. </p><p>"Visions of River facedown in the pool assaulted his thoughts and lies pierced his conscience that he was a failure as a father, that he had let River down," she continued. "In a moment of utter despair, he fumbled for the gun he kept in the drawer by his bed for safety on the road, aiming to end the pain."</p><p>"That night my sweet, incredible husband, the wonderful father of my kids, put a cold Glock 9mm into his mouth."</p><p>Amber shared that she is still wrestling with grief over her husband's struggle with suicide during that dark moment.</p><p>"I cry even typing this," she wrote. "It breaks my heart that he felt like this was the only way out. I wish I had known. I wish I could have grabbed him, shaken him, and said, ‘You’re a good father! I love you! We’ve got this! This isn’t the way!’ </p><p>"But I didn’t have to," she continued. "By the sheer grace of God, Granger became aware that the voice quietly telling him to pull the trigger wasn’t his own. He realized suddenly that he was under attack. He was engulfed in spiritual warfare."</p><p>Amber wrote that Granger, who is now a minister, turned to his faith during that moment of crisis.  </p><p>"He did the only thing he knew to do, crying out, ‘Jesus, save me! Save me, please, Jesus, save me!’" she wrote in the book. "In that moment of crying out to God, the visions suddenly stopped, the gun slipped out of his hand and he collapsed to the floor, falling asleep in a puddle of his own tears, fully clothed on the bathroom floor of his bus."</p><p>Amber recalled that Granger texted her the following morning, saying he had had "an awful night," drank too much and "came face to face with Satan."</p><p>"He never shared with me that he came so close to pulling the trigger," she wrote. "Not until three and a half years later."</p><p>In April 2024, Smith announced on Instagram that he had decided to retire from country music and his summer "Like A River" tour, which was named for his late son, would be his last.</p><p>In an interview with Entertainment Tonight in August 2024, Granger recalled that he thought of his two older children — daughter London, now 14, and son Lincoln, now 11 — during the moment he was contemplating suicide.</p><p>"I had one thought and it was Lincoln and London, my two kids at home. That was the first thought that hit me," he said. "I thought I just saw their faces and then I said, 'Jesus, help me.'"</p><p>He explained that surrendering to his faith in that moment set him on his path to becoming a minister. </p><p>"I said, 'Jesus, save me,' and suddenly I felt life sort of stop for the first time," Granger said.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Scientists from Australia are touting the results of bite-resistant wetsuit materials to reduce deaths from shark attacks.</p><p>Researchers from Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia, tested four wetsuit materials — Aqua Armour, Shark Stop, ActionTX-S and Brewster — inviting white and tiger sharks to bite the material as it was dragged behind a boat. </p><p>Tiger and white sharks are the two species responsible for the most unprovoked shark attacks.</p><p>"It’s not the entire suit, right, they’ve only used that special material in special parts of the suit, and it’s designed to protect you in the places that are most dangerous for blood loss and protect the major arteries," Nick Whitney, a senior scientist at the New England Aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life in Boston told the Associated Press. </p><p>Whitney was not involved in the study. </p><p>While the scientists found that catastrophic injuries could still occur, all four materials were found to lessen damage from shark bites. </p><p>Whitney noted that most people bitten by sharks die from blood loss, not from being eaten or carried away. </p><p>"It’s typically a bite and release so they bleed to death," he explained. "So, the goal of these suits is to protect you in specific areas and buy extra time for you to get to the beach and get to lifeguards and get medical assistance."</p><p>Chainmail wetsuits were created in the 1970s, but the researchers said that they didn’t offer the flexibility of movement necessary for activities like surfing and diving. </p><p>"New wetsuits that incorporate strong and light fibre often used in sailing rope, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, offer both flexibility and protection, making them more suitable for recreational use," the researchers said. </p><p>Dr. Thomas Clarke, of the College of Science and Engineering at Flinders University and study co-author, said that "While there were small differences between the four tested materials, they all reduced the amount of substantial and critical damage, which would typically be associated with severe haemorrhaging and tissue or limb loss." </p><p>The findings were published on Thursday in the journal Wildlife Research.</p><p>"Our study showed that bite-resistant materials incorporated into wetsuits can reduce damage from large white and tiger sharks (up to 3 metres) compared to standard neoprene wetsuit, even from moderate and severe bites," Clarke added. </p><p>Flinders University Professor Charlie Huveneers, study co-author who leads the Southern Shark Ecology Group, said that while the suits don’t eliminate the risk from sharks, "our results indicate that they can reduce blood loss and trauma from major lacerations and punctures, potentially saving lives."</p><p>The researchers concluded that all four materials "offer an improved level of protection that can reduce severe wounds and blood loss, and should be considered as part of the toolbox and measures available to reduce shark-bite risk and resulting injuries."</p><p>There were fewer than 50 unprovoked shark attacks globally last year, with most of the attacks in the U.S. happening in Florida. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump to meet with top congressional leaders at White House as government shutdown looms</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump plans to meet with congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle on Monday, as a possible government shutdown looms, a White House official confirmed to Fox News. </p><p>The meeting comes after the president canceled one last week with Democrats, claiming they had "unserious and ridiculous demands." </p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., were set to meet with Trump on Thursday to discuss a path forward to avert a partial government shutdown before the Sept. 30 deadline.</p><p>Schumer and Jeffries will now meet with Trump, along with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. </p><p>Schumer and Jeffries put out a joint statement on Saturday on the rescheduled meeting. </p><p>"President Trump has once again agreed to a meeting in the Oval Office," the statement said. "As we have repeatedly said, Democrats will meet anywhere, at any time and with anyone to negotiate a bipartisan spending agreement that meets the needs of the American people. We are resolute in our determination to avoid a government shutdown and address the Republican healthcare crisis. Time is running out."</p><p>The Senate is expected to return on Sept. 29 following the Jewish new year, and the House is expected to be out until the deadline to keep the government funded passes.</p><p>In a lengthy post on Truth Social last week, Trump blasted Schumer and Jeffries for pushing "radical Left policies that nobody voted for." </p><p>"I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive," Trump added at the time. </p><p>The now-canceled meeting with Trump came on the heels of a letter from Schumer and Jeffries sent over that weekend where the top congressional Democrats laid the possibility of a shutdown on his and Republicans’ feet.</p><p>They argued that the Trump-backed short-term extension was "dirty," which would mean it had partisan policy riders or spending attached to it, and panned it for continuing "the Republican assault on healthcare," ignoring expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium subsidies, and possibly leading to the closure of hospitals and other healthcare facilities across the country.</p><p>"With the September 30th deadline fast approaching, Republicans will bear responsibility for another painful government shutdown because of the refusal of GOP congressional leadership to even talk with Democrats," they wrote at the time.</p><p>But Trump argued that their bill would allow for the nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts in his "Big, Beautiful Bill" to be repealed, and also blasted the Democratic continuing resolution (CR) for ending his bill's $50 billion rural hospital fund. </p><p>"We must keep the Government open, and legislate like true Patriots rather than hold American Citizens hostage, knowing that they want our now thriving Country closed," he said. </p><p>"I’ll be happy to meet with them if they agree to the Principles in this Letter," Trump continued. "They must do their job! Otherwise, it will just be another long and brutal slog through their radicalized quicksand. To the Leaders of the Democrat Party, the ball is in your court. I look forward to meeting with you when you become realistic about the things that our Country stands for. DO THE RIGHT THING!"</p><p>Without any action, a shutdown would start at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday.</p><p>Johnson said last week that he had encouraged Trump to cancel the meeting last Thursday. </p><p>"He and I talked about it at length yesterday and the day before. I said, look, when they get their job done, once they do the basic governing work of keeping the government open, as president, then you can have a meeting with him," Johnson said on the "Mike &amp; McCarty Show." "Of course, it might be productive at that point, but right now, this is just a waste of his time."</p><p><i>Fox News' Alex Miller and Elizabeth Elkind and the Associated Press contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">EXCLUSIVE: Democrats risk flood insurance lapse in their shutdown fight, home builders and White House warn</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> As the Sept. 30 government funding deadline looms, the Trump administration is warning that millions of Americans could lose flood insurance coverage if Democrats refuse to back a House-passed spending bill that also extends the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).</p><p>The White House supports the continuing resolution (CR) approved by House Republicans, which would avert a shutdown and reauthorize the NFIP. </p><p>Administration officials said they worked to ensure NFIP was part of the current funding package, reflecting what they call the urgency of protecting millions of policyholders during hurricane season.</p><p>Democrats have said they will not support the measure, citing broader spending disputes. Trump administration officials argue the standoff puts homeowners, the housing market and disaster recovery funds at risk just as peak storm season arrives.</p><p>"In an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital, a White House official said: ‘The NFIP is a vital program utilized by millions of Americans, and it’s not a hard call to extend it – which is exactly why the administration supports the House-passed CR that would do so. Unfortunately, Democrats are happy to shut down the government and hurt the many thousands of Americans who rely on this program in the process.’"</p><p>According to administration figures reviewed by Fox News Digital, a lapse in NFIP authorization could disrupt about 1,300 property sales every day. That’s roughly 40,000 closings in a single month, all in areas where flood insurance is required to secure a mortgage.</p><p>More than 400,000 policies are set to expire in October. Officials say about 152,000 of those have been prepaid, but more than 250,000 households could still lose coverage if the program stalls.</p><p>Administration officials also pointed to October 2024 as a warning sign. That month saw more than 427,000 new or renewed policies. Roughly 41,000 homeowners bought new policies while about 33,000 dropped coverage, leaving a net gain of nearly 9,000. Officials warn that similar growth this year could collapse if NFIP lapses.</p><p>Administration officials told Fox News Digital that FEMA currently has $2.6 billion available to pay valid claims, including $1.5 billion in the National Flood Insurance Fund and $1.1 billion in reserves. But they warned the agency would be unable to borrow additional money from the Treasury if a major disaster exceeded those reserves, a scenario they described as "dangerous and avoidable."</p><p>The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) echoed those concerns. </p><p>"Past disruptions of the NFIP have caused immediate and widespread negative impacts on property sales, home values and consumer confidence," NAHB said in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital.</p><p>"Home sales would cease in areas where flood insurance is mandatory in order to obtain a mortgage. What the housing market needs now is stability and certainty. NAHB calls upon the House to act quickly to continue to fund the operations of the federal government including the extension of the NFIP."</p><p>The NFIP has a long history of stopgap extensions. Since 2017, Congress has reauthorized the program more than 30 times, often through short-term measures. Lawmakers have typically made coverage retroactive to prevent permanent gaps, but even brief lapses have stalled real estate closings and left homeowners in limbo. The program currently serves about 4.5 million policyholders nationwide.</p><p>Unless lawmakers strike a deal, FEMA will be barred from selling or renewing flood insurance policies starting Oct. 1, a lapse that could leave millions of homeowners in limbo as Washington hurtles toward a shutdown. Administration officials argue the risk is especially acute this year as hurricane season continues.</p><p>FEMA, Schumer and Jeffries did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The WNBA handed down its punishment for Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve following her actions during and after Friday's playoff game. </p><p>Reeve will be suspended for the team's next postseason game and ordered to pay an undisclosed fine. The Lynx are scheduled to play Game 4 of their semifinals series on Sunday.</p><p>Late in the fourth quarter of Game 3 against the Phoenix Mercury, Reeve was seen aggressively pursuing a referee. After the pursuit, Reeve appeared to engage in a verbal altercation with the game official. </p><p>After her ejection, the Lynx head coach refused to leave the court in a reasonable timeframe. There were just over 21 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter at the time Reeve was tossed.</p><p>Reeve also appeared to direct comments toward fans as she eventually left the court.</p><p>After the Lynx suffered an 84-76 loss to the Mercury, Reeve went on a lengthy rant in the postgame press conference.</p><p>In her postgame rant, Reeve called for the WNBA to make changes at the league level when it comes to officiating.</p><p>"If this is what the league wants, OK, but I want to call for a change of leadership at the league level when it comes to officiating," Reeve said. "The officiating crew that we had tonight, for the leadership to deem those three people semifinal-playoff worthy, it's f---ing malpractice."</p><p>Isaac Barnett, Randy Richardson and Jenna Reneau were the three game officials from Friday night.</p><p>Minnesota assistant coaches Eric Thibault and Rebekkah Brunson also were fined by the league.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Turning Point USA spokesperson Andrew Kolvet on Saturday called for the firing of a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor, who allegedly belongs to a radical gun group linked to multiple violent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) attacks.</p><p>Dwayne Dixon, an Asian and Middle Eastern Studies professor at the school's Chapel Hill campus, is allegedly a member of Redneck Revolt's Silver Valley chapter — an offshoot of the John Brown Gun Club, which was tied to at least two violent attacks at ICE facilities in Washington and Texas, Fox News Digital previously reported.</p><p>Kolvet's demand, which he posted to X, came after John Brown Gun Club recruitment flyers were seen on Georgetown University's campus Wednesday and Thursday with the writing, "Hey fascist! Catch this!" an apparent nod to writing that was written on bullet casings linked to Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's Sept. 10 assassination. </p><p>"I posted this flyer our team spotted at Georgetown, and now we find out professors at "elite" schools are members of this group and its offshoots," Kolvet wrote in the post. "This professor must be immediately fired and the group/network investigated."</p><p>Earlier this month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order instructing federal agencies to "investigate, disrupt and dismantle" any illegal operations linked to Antifa.</p><p>The flyer coined the posse as "the only political group that celebrates when Nazis die," and linked to a page where organizers said they were "building a community that's done with ceremonial resistance and strongly worded letters," instead focusing on "real change."</p><p>A University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill spokesperson previously told Fox Digital the school respects free speech, noting it does not "monitor or comment on the lawful personal activities or political views of individual employees."</p><p>It is unclear if Dixon is being investigated, or will face any disciplinary action. </p><p>His photo is not included in his staff biography.</p><p>Redneck Revolt, described by the Counter Extremism Project as a "far-left" gun club, rejects capitalism and the nation-state, often deploying armed members to protests and claiming to shield left-wing activists from "fascist" or "white supremacist" opponents.</p><p>Dixon faced multiple charges after allegedly attending protests in Durham and Charlottesville in 2017, armed with a semi-automatic rifle, though charges were later dropped. </p><p>He was also charged with assault during the 2018 toppling of UNC’s Silent Sam statue, a case that was later dismissed, according to WRAL.</p><p>Redneck Revolt was sued by Charlottesville and local businesses under anti-paramilitary and nuisance laws after a 2017 rally.

<div class="article-title">FBI's Patel clarifies role of hundreds of agents on Jan 6, says Wray lied to Congress</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> The FBI responded on Saturday to a report that 274 plainclothes agents were at the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, clarifying the role of bureau personnel while still blasting former Director Christopher Wray.</p><p>While the agents were on hand, they were sent in after the riot had begun to try to control the unruly crowd, officials told Fox News Digital. That is not the proper role of FBI agents, and Wray was not forthcoming about what happened when he testified numerous times on Capitol Hill, Director Kash Patel said.</p><p>"Agents were sent into a crowd control mission after the riot was declared by Metro Police – something that goes against FBI standards," Patel told Fox News Digital. "This was the failure of a corrupt leadership that lied to Congress and to the American people about what really happened."</p><p>He added, "Thanks to agents coming forward, we are now uncovering the truth. We are fully committed to transparency, and justice and accountability continues with this FBI." </p><p>There’s no indication any FBI agents were involved in any events related to Trump’s speech on the morning of Jan. 6 at the Ellipse, an FBI official told Fox News Digital, adding that Wray should have disclosed that agents were there when he was asked by congressional leaders.</p><p>President Donald Trump, citing a report that the agents were in the crowd which did not make clear their mission, said earlier that Wray, "has some major explaining to do."</p><p>"It was just revealed that the FBI had secretly placed, against all Rules, Regulations, Protocols, and Standards, 274 FBI Agents into the Crowd just prior to, and during, the January 6th Hoax," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday afternoon following a report from The Blaze, revealing the number of agents that were there. </p><p>Trump added, "This is different from what Director Christopher Wray stated, over and over again! That’s right, as it now turns out, FBI Agents were at, and in, the January 6th Protest, probably acting as Agitators and Insurrectionists, but certainly not as ‘Law Enforcement Officials.’"</p><p>The president said he wanted to know each officer’s identity and what they were doing at the U.S. Capitol. </p><p>"Many Great American Patriots were made to pay a very big price only for the love of their Country," he said, referring to Trump supporters who faced charges for their involvement on Jan. 6.</p><p>Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of every person charged for involvement on Jan. 6 after he took office this year. </p><p>He concluded, "I owe this investigation of ‘Dirty Cops and Crooked Politicians' to them! Christopher Wray, the then Director of the FBI, has some major explaining to do. That’s two in a row, Comey and Wray, who got caught LYING, with our Great Country at stake. WE CAN NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN TO AMERICA AGAIN!" </p><p>Citing a senior congressional source, the Blaze report said that the number of agents wasn’t "necessarily a surprise" because the FBI often "embeds countersurveillance personnel at large events."</p><p>Wray told a House Committee on Nov. 15, 2023, "If you are asking if the violence at the Capitol was part of some operation orchestrated by FBI sources or agents, the answer is no," but he wouldn’t disclose if any agents or sources were embedded within the crowd. </p><p>The 274 agents also includes those who were responding to the pipe bombs placed near the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters the night before Jan. 6, according to Politico. </p><p>Trump nominated Wray as FBI director in 2017 after he fired former FBI director James Comey, who was just indicted by a grand jury this week for allegedly making false statements to Congress. </p><p>A report released last December by Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz said: "We found no evidence in the materials we reviewed or the testimony we received showing or suggesting that the FBI had undercover employees in the various protest crowds, or at the Capitol, on January 6," although he acknowledged there were 26 paid informants, but only three of them were assigned by the FBI to be there.</p><p>The report also said that FBI personnel were sent to the Capitol at the request of overwhelmed Capitol Police to help with crowd control. </p><p>Horowitz said that none of the informants were allowed to incite the crowd, break the law or enter the U.S. Capitol. </p><p>In its reporting, Blaze noted that there may have been confusion regarding "plainclothes" and "undercover," meaning both the inspector general and the FBI could be telling the truth. </p><p>Many of the agents weren't happy to have been sent to the Capitol to do crowd control, another official told Fox News Digital. It was a chaotic scene with no pre-planning that contradicted the agency's original plan to not get involved in the event. The official said that agents are not trained to do crowd control. </p><p>The first agents arrived at the Capitol around 2:30 p.m. — there's no evidence there were any there before a riot was declared — and agents continued to arrive after that, the official added. </p><p>Wray had testified before Congress prior to the inspector general's report being released in December, but Patel called out Wray for deflecting and giving a "D.C. answer" when pressed by lawmakers. </p><p>"Why it took a ton of time and questioning in Congress for the director to get that point is what I'm trying to eliminate from the FBI," Patel said. "If Congress asks you a question under oath, whether or not there were sources in [or] around Jan. 6th at the Capitol, you as the director of the FBI need to know that and not deflect and give a D.C. answer. You have to be prepared for that."</p><p><i>Fox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>"Warning: The black course is an extremely difficult course we recommend only for European golfers."</p><p>That's what the infamous sign upon entering Bethpage Black might as well say after Day Two of the Ryder Cup in Farmingdale.</p><p>After a 3-1 showing in the morning, the Euros fought through the taunts of fans and tensions inside the ropes to grab another three points to the Americans' one in the afternoon session and expand their lead to 11.5-4.5.</p><p></p><p>With a chance for the USA to steal the final match on 18, Tyrrell Hatton and Matt Fitzpatrick stuck their iron shots to inside three feet, while Sam Burns and Patrick Cantlay were ways away, changing all the momentum brought by J.J. Spaun just minutes earlier after he birdied 18 to win his match.</p><p>The early talk of this year's Ryder Cup had been that the United States would have incredible home-field advantage. Apparently, it's been anything but, yet the crowds were attempting to do their part. However, some may have crossed lines.</p><p>Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry heard it from fans all day. McIlroy was spotted telling a fan to "shut the f--- up" in the morning session. Lowry had to be held back by a caddie on the 10th tee and asked security to escort a fan away. Lowry also backed off a shot twice as fans were counting the seconds he took to swing. On six, he stared down a particular fan after dropping a putt to halve a hole. He even dropped a "f--- you" to a fan after eagling the fourth.</p><p>Golf Digest reported that, through four holes, there were 30 F-bombs directed toward McIlroy. Plenty of other insults about his Irish heritage and even his performance at Pinehurst No. 2 in the 2024 U.S. Open were heard. A fan was threatened with ejection by security on the 15th green after swearing at McIlroy.</p><p>In more playful banter, this time at 16, again in the afternoon, a fan chirped McIlroy by saying he is "not that good." McIlroy promptly responded, "I'm really f---ing good" and smoked a drive down the middle.</p><p>European captain Luke Donald stayed relatively melancholy when discussing the Long Island crowd but made note of when fans do "cross the line."</p><p>"It was loud. It was raucous. What I consider crossing the line is personal insults and making sounds when they are trying to hit on their backswings or very close to when they are trying to go into their routines. That did happen a little bit. It's happened at other Ryder Cups, too," he said. "It's something we prepared for, and I can see, I think, how well they have dealt with it.</p><p>"I think people have individually different ways to deal with it. But, you know, crowds have energy, and you can use it however you want. It's however you frame it. There's a stimulus, a response, and in between that is how you decide what you want to do with it, okay. I think some people find that motivating. So, you know, sometimes the crowd going at you can be a motivator for some of these players, and I think Rory and Shane certainly looked like they were sort of almost enjoying the difficult environment out there."</p><p>It was not just the fans exchanging pleasantries with the players, though.</p><p>Bryson DeChambeau and Tommy Fleetwood got into it on the 15th green, as caddies also began to share pleasantries following Justin Rose lining up a putt. But Keegan Bradley said the beef was squashed shortly afterward.</p><p>"In sports, golf, it's blown into this huge thing. It happens in sports all the time," Bradley said. "They seemed fine after the round. You know, it's super passionate out there, especially for — well, for both sides. But from what I understand, everything was fine after the round. These sort of things happen when you're playing for your country."</p><p>Fleetwood then earned his fourth point in as many matches this weekend on the very next hole, as his partner Justin Rose birdied to win the match, 3 &amp; 2. Fleetwood is now 11-3-2 in his Ryder Cup career, the best record by any Euro with at least 10 matches played.</p><p>While Fleetwood is a Ryder Cup legend, world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is anything but. He is 0-4-0 this weekend and became the first player since 1971 to lose his first three matches and then go back out for a fourth on Saturday.</p><p>Facing the largest deficit entering Sunday under the current 28-point format (since 1979), the United States needs 10 points to win the Ryder Cup. That would be the most points ever scored by one team in the event's history, and only 12 are available in Sunday singles.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">From Magic Kingdom weddings to funeral urns, 'Disney Adults' have an undying passion</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>For some adults, their hobby is fantasy football. For others, it is Broadway shows, day-trading or maybe pickleball.</p><p>But for another passionate group of Americans — with or without kids of their own — it's all about Disney.</p><p>A recent article labeled Disney enthusiasts "the most hated group online" and such criticism often comes with viral anecdotes, like a 2022 Reddit post from a couple who admitted they skipped catering their wedding to pay for a 30-minute appearance by Mickey and Minnie Mouse.</p><p>The couple may not be alone in their dedication. Roughly 1,500 couples get married at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., each year, according to wedding planners.</p><p>And some fans love Disney until death — literally.</p><p>In the new book "Disney Adults: Exploring (And Falling In Love With) A Magical Subculture," author AJ Wolfe describes visitors who have scattered the ashes of loved ones on rides like the Haunted Mansion, despite repeated warnings from park staff.</p><p>"They take one last trip there before they die," Wolfe writes. "And they even buy funeral urns etched with images of Disney World's Cinderella Castle."</p><p>Disney adults talk about "converting" their loved ones into fans because Disney is a kind of church for them, according to Wolfe, who is also the founder of the Disney Food Blog.</p><p>Wolfe spoke with a San Diego tattoo artist who exclusively inks Disney-related art and a couple who regularly flew from New York City to Disney World for single overnight stays.</p><p>"We max out our credit cards to go," Wolfe wrote of her Disney community. "We count down the days until we can go again and plan obsessively about what we’re going to do, eat, wear, and experience the next time we’re there. We post on social media about how life ceases in between trips."</p><p>Journalists covering the parks have noted more child-free millennials and Gen Xers since the pandemic, with after-hours events, food and cocktails catering to an older crowd.</p><p>In 2023, Walt Disney World drew about 48.8 million visitors, according to reports. Part of Disney's draw lies in its unmatched reputation, said Roy Schwartz, a New York-based pop culture historian and author.</p><p>"Disney is probably the most iconic brand in entertainment," Schwartz told Fox News Digital. "They're the most associated with classic, timeless, innocent stories and characters. That's very appealing to childless adults who're looking for a way to recapture or keep alive that feeling of delight and comfort."</p><p>While Schwartz acknowledges that part of the loyalty is cultivated through savvy corporate strategy, he believes much of it is organic. Adults are searching for community, identity and simple joys, whether it be through Disney, Taylor Swift, CrossFit or political movements.</p><p>Wolfe admits that Disney adults are buying what the multibillion-dollar corporation is selling.</p><p>In her book, she describes "smellizer" machines that pump scents of apple pie, jasmine and roses into the air to entice shoppers in the parks. </p><p>"Everything at Disney is bigger, brighter, and more infused with visuals, smells, feelings, flavors and sounds," she wrote.</p><p>Critics often dismiss Disney fans as people who refuse to grow up, but Wolfe describes Walt Disney World as a safe, predictable escape. </p><p>For her, Disney was still preferable to European, Alaskan or Thai vacations after she became a mother. </p><p>"They spoke English and used American dollars, transportation was simple and urgent care for my asthmatic kid was highly accessible," she wrote.</p><p>Experts agree the appeal is about comfort, connection and fun.</p><p>"Sometimes we need to revisit childlike spaces — like Disney — in order to heal our inner child," Dr. Robyn Koslowitz, a New Jersey-based clinical psychologist and trauma specialist, told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Dr. Debra Kissen, CEO of Light On Anxiety Treatment Centers in Chicago, agreed, calling Disney a "turnkey escape."</p><p>"It offers safety, cleanliness, predictable logistics and a reliable emotional arc," she said. "Adults often use the space more intentionally as a mood reset, a couples ritual or a hobby."</p><p>But that fandom can tip into excess.</p><p>Kissen advises asking, "Is work, sleep or relationships suffering? Are you spending beyond your means or hiding costs? Can you skip an event without distress?</p><p>"If yes to any, it's time to set guardrails — budgets, trip frequency, 'no-park' months, or diversify your hobbies," she said.</p><p>Wolfe told Fox News Digital that her interviews with Disney adults showed her that their fandom isn’t their only defining characteristic. </p><p>"It’s a hobby among many others," she said. "Having an affinity for Disney allows people to process life with a bit more optimism — that you can be strong, grow, be the hero of your own story and that happily ever after can happen."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Mikie Sherrill remains silent on issue of trans athletes in women's sports as Trump calls her out for it</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New Jersey Democrat candidate for governor Mikie Sherrill has not addressed her congressional voting record on bills related to transgender athletes in women's sports. </p><p>President Donald Trump called out Sherrill for her stance on the issue in a Truth Social post on Thursday. </p><p>"Sherrill wants Open Borders (again!), men playing in Women’s Sports, Transgender for everyone, and all of the things that almost DESTROYED America," Trump wrote.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Sherrill's campaign multiple times for clarification on her stance on the issue of trans athletes in women's sports but has not received a response. </p><p>Sherrill has been the subject of criticism on social media for her congressional voting record on the issue. She voted against the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act twice when the bill was first proposed in 2023 and again in February when it was reintroduced. </p><p>Sherrill also co-sponsored the Equality Act but also co-sponsored the Transgender Bill of Rights, which more explicitly "guarantees certain rights for transgender and nonbinary people with respect to public services and accommodations." </p><p>Sherrill is a self-proclaimed "advocate for women’s athletics."  She previously proposed the Women in NCAA Sports Act in the U.S. House of Representatives alongside Rep. Maria Salazar, D-Fla., and led a resolution to honor Billie Jean King with the Congressional Gold Medal. </p><p>However, she has recently been the subject of criticism on social media for her congressional voting record on the issue of trans athletes in women's sports. </p><p>Former University of Pennsylvania women's swimmer and women's sports activist Paula Scanlan, the first UPenn swimmer to speak up about the school's Lia Thomas controversy in 2022, called out Sherrill on X over the issue this week. </p><p>The New Jersey GOP attacked Sherrill for this record directly in a campaign graphic last week. </p><p>Sherrill's opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, mentioned this issue for Sherrill in a post back in July. </p><p>New Jersey is the original home state of well-known transgender track and field athlete Sadie Schreiner, who previously competed for Rochester Institute for Technology and went viral multiple times for posting videos sharing the athlete's firsthand experience as a biological male trans athlete competing against, and often dominating, females. Schreiner is from Hillsborough, according to the athlete's RIT Athletics page. </p><p>Schreiner has filed a lawsuit against Princeton University for an alleged incident at a May 3 women's race. Schreiner's lawsuit claimed the athlete attempted to participate in the women's 200-meter sprint at the Larry Ellis Invitational as one of the 141 participants unattached to a university or club. The suit alleges officials told Schreiner the athlete could not participate 15 minutes before the race began. </p><p>Schreiner alleged the university violated the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, which designates "gender identity or expression" as a protected status. </p><p>Schreiner has since filed a second lawsuit against SUNY Genesco for being banned from a women's race in March, per multiple reports.</p><p>Back in January, a New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. </p><p>Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women. Among 1,022 Republicans, that number was 94%. </p><p>The 81 independents who were interviewed represented the group with the most reluctance to say transgender athletes shouldn't be allowed to compete. Just 64% said they were against it, while 26% refused to answer. Just 3% of the Democrats and 1% of the Republicans refused to answer.</p><p>Nearly 70% of Americans say biological men should not be permitted to compete in women's sports, according to a Gallup poll last year.</p><p>Additional data suggests the issue impacted the 2024 election. </p><p>A national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America (CWA) legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of "Donald Trump’s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls' and women’s sports and of transgender boys and men using girls' and women’s bathrooms" as important to them. And 6% said it was the most important issue of all, while 44% said it was "very important."</p><p>Meanwhile, prominent Democratic figures have backpedaled on their party's support for males in women's sports, including Pete Buttigieg, Gavin Newsom and even Kamala Harris. </p><p>In her recent book "107 Days," Harris wrote that she "agrees" with the concerns of parents and athletes who oppose letting males compete with females.</p><p>"I agree with the concerns expressed by parents and players that we have to take into account biological factors such as muscle mass and unfair student athletic advantage when we determine who plays on which teams, especially in contact sports," Harris wrote. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">These are the top global and US airlines based on new rankings: 'Like flying private'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A new list has named the top 10 global world-class airlines, and one small airline made the list for the first time ever, while a boutique Texas carrier also claimed top honors in a separate U.S. ranking.</p><p>The prestigious APEX "World Class" award, presented annually by the Airline Passenger Experience Association, recognizes just 10 airlines worldwide that meet the highest standards of service, safety and passenger satisfaction.</p><p>This year, Fiji Airways, the national carrier of the South Pacific country, landed on the list for the first time, making it the smallest airline by fleet size to ever receive the APEX honor and the first in Oceania to receive it, according to the airline.</p><p>Andre Viljoen, managing director and CEO of Fiji Airways, said in a statement that the recognition, which was announced Sept. 11, "is a proud and historic moment for the airline and for Fiji."</p><p>"In 2016, we were ranked outside the world's Top 100 airlines," Viljoen said. "Today, through sheer grit, relentless innovation and the unbreakable spirit of our people, we have risen to be named one of the Top 10 Airlines in the world.</p><p>"This recognition is not just an award. It's about showing every Fijian, and every member of our team, that we can achieve the impossible."</p><p>Fiji Airways undertook a massive overhaul of its in-flight experience, upgrading equipment, building new supply chains, partnering with local businesses and introducing new premium products, the company said in a news release. </p><p>The airline also revamped its dining with Pacific Rim-inspired cuisine, retrained hundreds of cabin crew and created a team of "World Class Trainers" to ensure service met global standards.</p><p>Founded in 1951 and known as Air Pacific until 2012, Fiji Airways now flies to several cities in the United States, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas and Honolulu.</p><p>The other airlines honored on APEX's "World Class" list this year, in no particular order, are All Nippon Airways, Emirates, Japan Airlines, Oman Air, Qatar Airways, Saudia, Singapore Airlines, Turkish Airlines and Xiamen Airlines.</p><p>Japan Airlines was honored specifically for safety and well-being. Saudia was honored for service-guest experience, and Turkish Airlines won "Best in Class: Sustainability and Food &amp; Beverage Execution."</p><p>"Achieving this higher standard reflects dedication not only to outstanding service and comfort but to safety, sustainability and customer satisfaction that resonate with travelers today," APEX CEO Joe Leader said in a statement.</p><p>"This distinction marks a significant stride toward a future where every flight should be benchmarked against a higher standard of world-class quality," he added.</p><p>APEX evaluates each airline through professional audits, yearlong customer reviews and expert peer assessments, according to the company.</p><p>"Smaller and regional carriers are starting to challenge the big players by focusing on niche excellence, better service, cultural authenticity and a sense of place that the mega-airlines can’t always replicate," said Francis Hellyer, co-founder and CEO of Tickadoo, an AI-powered service that helps people discover and book experiences in major cities.</p><p>"The trend to watch is boutique excellence," Hellyer told Fox News Digital. "Airlines like Fiji show that you can stand alongside the giants if you focus on service, identity and consistency."</p><p>And that trend isn’t limited to international airlines.</p><p>Travel + Leisure magazine released its 2025 World's Best Awards survey of U.S. domestic airlines in July, and readers chose JSX, a Houston-based boutique public charter carrier that offers private jet–style service around the country. It was the second year in a row JSX topped the list.</p><p>Readers praised it for speedy, 20-minute check-ins and free Wi-Fi. It outscored its closest competitor by more than 12 points, according to the outlet.</p><p>Flying JSX is "almost like flying private," one Travel + Leisure reader said. "Friendly staff, easy check-in, help with boarding, luggage."</p><p>The list, which highlights airlines for timeliness, safety, customer service and amenities, also included Hawaiian Airlines, Breeze Airways, Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines in the top five. Delta was the only major "big four" carrier to rank that high.</p><p>Rounding out the top 10 were JetBlue, Southwest, United, American and Sun Country, reflecting a mix of legacy airlines and newer low-cost carriers.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Ciattarelli unloads on Mikie Sherrill in NJ town hall, citing immigration and Naval Academy: ‘Not a centrist’</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New Jersey GOP gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli called out his opponent, U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., during a town hall Saturday, branding her as out of step with the Garden State on immigration, policing, taxes and ethics.</p><p>"She wants you to believe she’s a Jersey girl. She’s not. She wants you to believe she’s a centrist. She’s not," Ciattarelli told voters.</p><p>The remarks preview Ciattarelli’s closing argument in a tight race for the state's top post as he seeks to define Sherrill by tying her to national Democrats and controversies over immigration enforcement, policing and left-wing allies. Both campaigns have been asked for comment.</p><p>Ciattarelli charged that Sherrill "supported Joe Biden’s open border policies" and "voted no on the Laken Riley Act." Sherrill missed the Riley Act vote earlier this year but later said she would have voted no, arguing the measure was overly broad.</p><p>He also accused her of backing policies on transgender athletes, saying "this mother of two daughters voted yes twice to allow biological boys to play in girls sports." Sherrill voted against GOP bills in 2023 and 2025 that would have banned transgender students from competing based on gender identity.</p><p>On immigration enforcement and policing, Ciattarelli said Sherrill "supports sanctuary cities" and "voted anti-police … looking to get rid of qualified immunity." Sherrill has spoken favorably of New Jersey’s 2018 "Immigrant Trust Directive" and supported the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which sought to curtail qualified immunity and policy police unions opposed.</p><p>He also attacked the congresswoman's opposition to the GOP’s 2025 "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which raised the SALT deduction cap to $40,000, expanded child credits and eliminated federal taxes on overtime and tips. Sherrill and all House Democrats voted no on the package.</p><p>Ethics featured prominently in Ciattarelli’s critique. He reminded voters Sherrill paid a fine under the STOCK Act after disclosing stock trades late and noted her household traded shares in defense companies while she sat on the House Armed Services Committee, though she divested individual holdings in 2019. </p><p>He also covered recent reports that Sherrill was disciplined in the 1994 Naval Academy cheating scandal for failing to report classmates, which barred her from walking at graduation even though she was commissioned.</p><p>Beyond the policy contrasts, Ciattarelli sought to cast Sherrill as aligned with the left. Reporting shows she welcomed support from Zohran Mamdani, the socialist nominee for New York City mayor, saying she shared his voters’ goal of "throwing out the old playbook." </p><p>Republicans labeled the embrace "disqualifying" and warned New Jerseyans could not afford such politics.</p><p>He also pointed to her remarks after the House voted to honor conservative activist Charlie Kirk following his assassination. Sherrill said Kirk had "advocated for a Christian nationalist government and to roll back the rights of women and Black people," while adding that the Constitution protects free speech "even for those I vehemently oppose." Sherrill voted for the resolution.</p><p>Throughout his remarks, Ciattarelli framed Sherrill as left-wing despite her record of caucusing with moderates. Sherrill once belonged to the centrist Blue Dog Coalition and is now a member of the New Democrat Coalition. </p><p>Ciattarelli, by contrast, leaned into his local roots, calling himself the "Jersey guy" and stressing that his family has lived and run businesses in the state for a century. </p><p>"How about we elect the Jersey guy? Ciattarellis have been here for a hundred years … always will be," he said.</p><p>Sherrill, a Navy helicopter pilot and Virginia native, was first elected in 2018 and has lived in Montclair with her family since 2010.</p><p>Ciattarelli, a CPA and former assemblyman, was the GOP nominee for governor in 2021. Polls suggest their 2025 rematch is close.</p><p>Ciattarelli’s attacks showcase his strategy of portraying Sherrill as tied to national Democrats and ethically compromised while presenting himself as a homegrown alternative. </p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to both campaigns for comment on Ciattarelli’s remarks and Sherrill’s past statements.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Lt. Col. George Hardy, one of the last surviving members of the famed Tuskegee Airmen, has died at age 100.</p><p>Hardy served in World War II as part of the unit of America's first Black military pilots. At age 19, he became the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot to fly his first combat sortie over Europe, according to the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. National Office.</p><p>"His legacy is one of courage, resilience, tremendous skill and dogged perseverance against racism, prejudice and other evils," the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. national office said in a statement Friday. "We are forever grateful for his sacrifice and will hold dear to his memory."</p><p>Stationed at Ramitelli Air Field in Italy during WWII, Hardy completed 21 missions over Germany and occupied Europe in P-51 Mustang aircraft. His death leaves only 13 documented original Tuskegee Airmen alive today, the organization noted.</p><p>Hardy, who was born in Philadelphia in 1925 and was the second of seven children, was upstairs doing homework Dec. 7, 1941, when he was interrupted with news of the Pearl Harbor attack, according to the National WWII Museum.</p><p>In 1944, he entered the U.S. Army Air Forces, trained at Tuskegee Army Air Field and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. By early 1945, Hardy deployed to Italy with the African American 99th Fighter Squadron, 332nd Fighter Group, the National WWII Museum noted.</p><p>Hardy’s service extended beyond World War II. He flew 45 missions in the Korean War and 70 in the Vietnam War. </p><p>He later earned degrees at the Air Force Institute of Technology and helped develop the Department of Defense's first global military telephone system before retiring as a lieutenant colonel in 1971, according to the National WWII Museum.</p><p>Following his retirement, Hardy became an advocate for keeping the Tuskegee Airmen’s story alive, speaking to students nationwide. The Tuskegee Airmen received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007 and, in 2024, the National WWII Museum’s American Spirit Award. </p><p>"When I think about the fellas who flew before me and with me at Tuskegee and the fact that we did prove that we could do anything that anyone else could do, and it’s paid off today ... it’s hard to believe that I’m here receiving this award — with them," Hardy said when accepting the American Spirit Award on behalf of the Tuskegee Airmen.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Russia's Sergey Lavrov warns NATO countries in UNGA speech after Trump shifts tone on Ukraine</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov used his address to the United Nations General Assembly (UGNA) Saturday to deliver one of Moscow’s starkest warnings yet to the West, accusing NATO and the European Union of waging a "real war" against Russia.</p><p>Lavrov opened with sweeping historical references to World War II, positioning Russia as the heir to the Soviet Union’s role in defeating Nazism and defending global sovereignty. He accused the U.S. of dismantling those postwar principles through interventions in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya and warned that the same was happening today in the Middle East. </p><p>While condemning Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, Lavrov said Israel’s campaign in Gaza amounted to "collective punishment" of civilians, linking the conflict to what he portrayed as decades of unchecked Western use of force.</p><p>Lavrov accused NATO of ignoring decades of security commitments. He insisted Russia has "never had and does not have" plans to attack NATO countries, calling Western warnings of a Russian offensive "provocations." </p><p>He singled out claims by European leaders as "false portrayals" of Moscow’s intentions, echoing President Vladimir Putin’s denials that Russia plans to strike NATO or EU territory. </p><p>At the same time, Lavrov issued a direct threat, saying, "Any aggression against my country will be met with a decisive response. There should be no doubt about this among those in NATO and the EU."</p><p>The warning comes amid heightened tension along NATO’s eastern flank. Estonia recently accused Russian jets of violating its airspace, and NATO forces shot down drones over Poland. The U.S. responded by telling the U.N. Security Council it would "defend every inch of NATO territory." Against this backdrop, Lavrov’s speech underscored Moscow’s effort to frame any clash with NATO as an existential threat to Russia itself.</p><p>The timing also intersects with a shift in U.S. rhetoric. President Donald Trump, who met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this week, has hardened his tone on the war, telling reporters that Ukraine <i>can</i> and <i>should</i> reclaim all its territory.</p><p>That marks a departure from earlier signals of openness to negotiation, more than a month after U.S. and Russian officials held rare talks in Alaska. Lavrov’s UN address seemed calibrated to counter Trump’s new line, reminding Washington that Moscow sees the war not as a distant conflict but as a direct confrontation involving the United States.</p><p>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, in his own address to the General Assembly, warned that failing to stop Russia now would unleash "the most destructive arms race ever."</p><p>Lavrov reinforced his message at a press conference after the speech, responding to a question about Western calls to shoot down Russian aircraft that might violate European airspace. He dismissed Trump’s earlier remark that Russia was a "paper tiger," noting that the president had already walked it back. </p><p>He then issued a stark warning: "If there are attempts to down any flying object … over our territory, in our airspace, then I think people will very much regret it, undertaking such an egregious violation of our territorial integrity and sovereignty."</p><p>Lavrov also took aim at U.S. sanctions on Iran, blasting Western efforts to restore or tighten restrictions as "illegal" and evidence of what he described as Washington’s strategy of "blackmail and pressure." </p><p>He said the West had sabotaged diplomatic options to revive the 2015 nuclear deal and rejected what he called manipulations at the U.N. Security Council to isolate Tehran.</p><p>Beyond Europe, Lavrov portrayed Russia as aligned with a rising "global majority" against Western dominance, pointing to BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and African and Latin American calls for greater representation at the U.N. Security Council. </p><p>He accused Washington of using sanctions and military blocs to preserve hegemony, while claiming Russia was defending sovereignty for nations across the Global South.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">DAVID MARCUS: DiCaprio's ‘One Battle After Another’ an ill-timed apologia for left-wing violence</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Timing, they say, is everything, and it is not director Paul Thomas Anderson’s fault that his latest film, "One Battle After Another<i>,"</i> is opening after the worst two weeks of American left-wing political violence in decades. But it sure makes it hard to watch.</p><p>Imagine a movie about World War II in which you are meant to be cheering for lovable Nazis.</p><p>The film is an adaptation of the 1990s novel "Vineland<i>,"</i> and it turns out making Thomas Pynchon novels into movies is a bit like translating James Joyce’s "Ulysses" into Chinese. You can do it, but you miss a lot.</p><p>What is missing here is even the slightest bit of nuance about the glorious necessity to kill people, including innocents, in order to topple Anderson’s weird and paranoid version of the American government.</p><p>At the top, Leonardo DiCaprio’s Bob Ferguson, or Rocketman character, is in a star-crossed love affair with Perfidia Beverly Hills, played by Teyana Taylor. When they aren’t blowing up immigration detention facilities — yes, you read that right — they find time to create a daughter.</p><p>Things go south when Perfidia murders an unarmed guard in cold blood during a bank heist while her partner yells about Black power. The killing disrupts their little family and sends Bob and daughter Willa into hiding as Perfidia runs off, presumably to Cuba.</p><p>The rest of the movie is spent with Sean Penn’s racist and sexually strange Army Col. Steven Lockjaw, who is auditioning for a secretive and elite white supremacist group called the Christmas Adventurers. They presumably have massive political power and spend their time chasing the father and daughter.</p><p>It’s not clear who this racist group is; it’s not even clear if the United States still exists. All we really know is that, aside from DiCaprio, pretty much all the white men in the movie are super-duper villains.</p><p>Lockjaw and his band of racists are just pure evil. There is nothing redeeming about them, and they clearly represent the American government or some version of it, because nobody ever stops Lockjaw from doing wildly illegal things.</p><p>Probably the strangest choice Anderson makes is to shift the time period of the story. In the original, the protagonists are 1960s radicals and the action takes place in 1984. That tracked. This does not.</p><p>"One Battle" starts with a mass political violence campaign from Perfidia’s group, called French 75, in about 2010, with the rest of the movie taking place in the present day. The idea that the federal government was engaged in racist fascism in Obama’s first term just feels absurd.</p><p>For this movie to make any sense at all, one has to believe the United States, today, right now, is a fascist dictatorship. That is not only a dangerous fallacy but, as we have found out recently, a deadly one.</p><p>It is also dangerous to celebrate murderers. Another eerie coincidence is that the film was released the same week exiled far-left cop killer Assata Shakur died in Cuba. The Chicago Teachers Union took to X to honor "the life and legacy of a revolutionary fighter." So the people who teach our kids, just like Anderson, it would seem, think killing cops is fine, as long as it is for the left.</p><p>Growing up in Philadelphia, the name Mumia Abu-Jamal, who sits on death row for killing a cop in the 1980s, was famous, as it is around the global left, where he is celebrated as some kind of hero.</p><p>But in the little Irish bars from Northeast Philly to the Italian Market, you will often see an old, dim photo of a man in a police hat and light blues. His name was Officer Daniel Faulkner, the man Abu-Jamal killed, a man who never became famous outside of our hearts.</p><p>As I walked to my car after the nearly three-hour indictment of America, I lit a cigarette and wondered how all these multimillionaires like DiCaprio and Anderson can live with themselves if they truly believe America is as rank and horrible as the film depicts.</p><p>How can all those actors at the Emmy Awards who yell "F--- ICE!" like ignorant toddlers reconcile that the same government is what protects their fabulous lifestyles of the rich and famous?</p><p>Anderson won’t be committing any "brave" acts of murder to right the supposed wrongs of our nation. He’ll just make movies encouraging others to do so while he basks in the fruits of capitalism.</p><p>The whole movie made me a little angry, but then I remembered that the Trump administration is cracking down on Antifa — today’s very real domestic terrorists — and maybe this will be a fun movie for them to watch once they are all in jail.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Atlantic calls out Dems for failing to take 'own advice' and moderate their policies</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Atlantic published an article criticizing Democrats for talking a big game about moderating their positions to win back the public, while failing to actually do so out of fear of their base.</p><p>While some rising Democratic leaders have called out the party as being too "weak and woke" and urged them to "retake the flag" after their historic loss in November, other commentators have challenged Democrats to specify which progressive cultural policies they will actually leave behind, knowing it might enrage their base.</p><p>The Atlantic’s assistant editor, Marc Novicoff, was the latest to weigh in, publishing a piece headlined "Democrats Don’t Seem Willing to Follow Their Own Advice." He asked, "Party leaders know they need to moderate on cultural issues to win back working-class voters — so why don’t they?" </p><p>The piece argued that, with a few exceptions, Democrats have avoided disavowing specific far-left policies, "whether regarding trans athletes or other high-profile social issues on which the party is vulnerable, such as immigration and climate."</p><p>One example Novicoff cited was Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., who said the political pendulum had swung too far leftward. Yet, "Even Torres’s big postelection immigration ‘flip-flop,’ as Politico put it, was to announce that he would no longer fight against the deportation of undocumented immigrants who have a criminal record."</p><p>Novicoff also highlighted another example of a Democrats offering symbolic policies that extend an olive branch to conservatives without alienating liberals, noting this was a "leading example" of moderation cited by The Washington Post.</p><p>He pointed to Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who boasted that he had legalized hunting on Sundays. </p><p>"No core constituency in the Democratic Party is outraged by the thought of hunting on Sundays, which is why you almost certainly heard nothing about Shapiro’s comment," Novicoff wrote.</p><p>Novicoff argued that the gold standard of actual moderation was former President Bill Clinton’s "Sister Souljah" moment in 1992, referencing when Clinton denounced the rapper's remarks about race while he was running for president, infuriating many far-left activists.</p><p>Elaine Kamarck, who worked in the Clinton White House, told The Atlantic that sometimes "you’ve got to go against your party," and "if nobody gets mad, you’re not doing anything courageous."</p><p>Even Trump, Novicoff argued, deserves some credit for using moderate messaging to win support. </p><p>"Trump is no moderate, but in 2016 and 2024, he used selective moderation to make inroads with swing voters who disapprove of certain unpopular Republican Party orthodoxies," the writer suggested. "In his first run for president, he committed to not cutting Social Security and Medicare, and he hammered his primary opponents for supporting the invasion of Iraq. </p><p>"In his 2024 run, he promised not to enact a national abortion ban. All three of these positions were broadly popular but offended core Republican constituencies — budget hawks, neoconservatives, and pro-lifers, respectively. They seem to have paid off."</p><p>But Democrats seem to have reason to fear their base if they attempt moderation. Novicoff recalled Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who angered progressives by opposing biological men competing in women’s sports. The Atlantic reported that Moulton quickly faced protesters at his district office, was branded a "Nazi cooperator" and drew a primary challenge from a transgender opponent. </p><p>Moulton asserted to The Atlantic that "fear of backlash" is what is holding many of his fellow Democrats back from changing their stances publicly.</p><p>Novicoff suggested that a key reason is that many Democrats hold safe seats, where their biggest threat is a primary challenge from the left. But, at the national level, he argued, refusing to moderate is a losing strategy.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Rep. Torres and Gov. Shapiro but did not receive an immediate response.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Texas teen killed his twin sister in mystery stabbing</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>In the early morning hours of Sept. 29, 2021, <span class="link">Benjamin Elliott</span>, then 17 years old, walked into his twin sister Meghan's bedroom. It was something he had done hundreds of times. But on this morning, he had a knife in his hand and stabbed her in the neck while she was asleep. He would later say he was sleepwalking. When he realized what he had done, he immediately called 911.</p><p>"I just killed my sister," Benjamin told the emergency operator. "Oh my God … I thought it was a dream."</p><p>Benjamin's parents Kathy and Michael Elliott faced a heartbreaking and unimaginable reality: their beloved daughter, Meghan, was dead, and her adoring twin brother — their son — was accused of intentionally murdering her. They could not imagine why, and neither could investigators. Correspondent Erin Moriarty investigates the extraordinary case of "The Boy Who Killed His Twin," for the 38th season premiere of "48 Hours," now streaming on Paramount+.</p><p>"What makes you so sure that you stabbed your sister while you were sleepwalking?" Moriarty asked Benjamin Elliott in a jailhouse interview earlier this year.</p><p>"I would never have done that," he replied. "I loved her. … She was my best and closest friend."</p>
<p>Benjamin's family, relatives and closest friends agreed. "He and Meghan are so close, you could never picture anything bad happening between them," Drue Whittecar, a longtime family friend of the Elliotts, told Moriarty.</p>
<p>"And how did she feel about Ben?" Moriarty asked.</p><p>"She loved him," Whittecar replied. "She looked up to him. … You would see her walk up next to him when she would feel uncomfortable and just kinda stand by him."</p><p>Moriarty also interviewed the prosecutors, Megan Long and Maroun Koutani.</p><p>"Were you able to find any evidence that there was a problem with … these twins?" Moriarty asked. "No," Long replied. "We definitely looked into it and tried." </p>
<p>So how could such a seemingly loving relationship between the twins end in an unfathomable tragedy? </p><p>That's what Benjamin's parents — Kathy, a senior manager with the Girl Scouts of America, and Michael, a stay-at-home dad — and their eldest daughter, Elizabeth, wanted to know.</p><p>The Elliotts initially feared that a mental health crisis was the cause. But it turned out that Benjamin, and some close relatives of the Elliotts, had a history of sleepwalking. In fact, a boyhood friend of the Elliott twins told their parents about a slumber party years earlier, when they found Benjamin eating a donut on a couch — while he was asleep.</p><p>Benjamin's defense attorneys, Cary Hart and Wes Rucker, asked Dr. Jerald Simmons, a neurologist and sleep disorder expert, to examine Benjamin. Simmons was initially skeptical. But after interviewing Benjamin, and hearing about his and his family's history of sleepwalking, Simmons conducted two sleep studies on him, with the teenager hooked up to devices that monitored his every movement. Simmons went from skeptic to believer. </p><p>He determined that Benjamin fell quickly into what is known as slow-wave sleep, or when people can sleepwalk. That's important because on the night Meghan was killed, Benjamin spent hours scrolling the web on his cell phone, except for a 24-minute period when his phone was inactive. Simmons believes that Benjamin was sleepwalking during that period, and unintentionally stabbed Meghan to death.      </p><p>"Do you believe Ben killed his sister without even realizing he was doing it in his sleep?" Moriarty asked Simmons. </p><p>"Yes," he replied. "Ben definitely killed his sister. He did it, there's no question, he's the one that had the knife and he stabbed her. But … he didn't do this voluntarily. There was no motivation."</p>
<p>Surprisingly, sleepwalking has proved to be a successful — albeit rare — criminal defense. For example, a Canadian man, Kenneth Parks, was accused of driving 14 miles to his mother-in-law's home, where he killed her. He claimed he was sleepwalking the entire time and was acquitted. And North Carolina father Joseph Mitchell, accused of strangling one of his children, said he was sleepwalking during the killing. He was also found not guilty.</p><p>The Elliotts were relieved, and frightened, at finally having an explanation. "It's scary as hell," Kathy Elliott said, adding, "if that can happen to us, then that could happen to anybody with a sleep problem." </p><p>They hoped Simmons' findings would end the investigation into Benjamin. After all, prosecutors admitted they could find no reason for the fatal stabbing. </p><p>But prosecutors were still not convinced. They questioned Benjamin's account of that night, his demeanor during an interrogation with a homicide detective and that he said he stabbed his sister once. That was important because the medical examiner determined Meghan had two wounds to her neck — and one was four inches deep and severed key arteries, which prosecutors believed should have left blood spatter at the scene.</p><p>Despite receiving Simmons' findings, prosecutors charged Benjamin with intentionally murdering his twin, and earlier this year, Benjamin stood trial. </p><p>The Elliotts had lost their daughter. No one knew why. Now, they faced losing their son. </p>

<div class="article-title">Trump moves to declassify Amelia Earhart records</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump told his administration on Friday to declassify any federal records <span class="link">about Amelia Earhart</span>, the pilot whose 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean has drawn decades of public fascination.</p><p>"Amelia made it almost three quarters around the World before she suddenly, and without notice, vanished, never to be seen again," the president wrote on Truth Social. "Her disappearance, almost 90 years ago, has captivated millions."</p><p>Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared as they flew toward Howland Island in the Pacific, part of her attempt to become the first female aviator to circumnavigate the world. </p><p>It's widely believed that Earhart crashed into the ocean near Howland Island after running out of fuel, says Laurie Gwen Shapiro, a journalist who wrote a book on Earhart. But other theories about where she and her plane ended up have circulated for decades — many of which lack clear evidence. Researchers are <span class="link">planning an expedition</span> to a remote island later this year.</p>
<p>It's not clear what, if any, classified documents the government may have on Earhart.  </p>
<p>But a lawmaker who represents the Northern Mariana Islands territory in the U.S. House pushed Mr. Trump to declassify and release Earhart records earlier this year, referring to "credible, firsthand accounts" that the aviator was spotted on the Pacific island of Saipan.</p><p>"Despite these recollections, her disappearance and the possibility that she may have died on our islands remain matters of unresolved historical inquiry," Del. Kimberlyn King-Hinds, a Republican, wrote in a July letter to the president.</p><p>One of the theories is that Earhart was on a spy mission for the U.S. government when she landed in Saipan and was taken into custody by the Japanese. </p><p>Documents previously released by the FBI contain a 1967 request for a security review of a manuscript that cites Navy files on Earhart that were marked "confidential," a level of classification. The manuscript's author, a senior officer in the Air Force, wrote that the conclusions in the Navy report were that Earhart was not on a spy mission, did not crash-land in Saipan, and was not held as a prisoner or executed as a spy. </p>
<p>The FBI, in approving that manuscript for publication — which is a typical process for current and former government officials — noted that the Navy files did "not warrant classification since the release of it would not be prejudicial to the national defense." </p><p>Shapiro called the theory that Earhart was taken captive in Saipan "nonsense."</p><p>"It's 99.9% that she ran out of gas," Shapiro told CBS News. She said Earhart and Noonan were low on fuel and "very ill-prepared" for their attempted flight to Howland Island, a tiny, difficult-to-find island in the middle of the ocean.</p><p>"It's very boring to tell people, you know what, she ran out of gas," Shapiro said. "The fantasy around it is amazing."</p><p>The National Archives and Records Administration has also previously released documents on the search for Earhart.  </p><p>In 1993, two Hawaiian lawmakers introduced bills in the House and Senate to require the government to release all records relating to Earhart's last flight and disappearance. The bills called for the declassification of "any such relevant records that have been classified as government secrets." The measures never made it out of the committees they were referred to. </p><p>Mr. Trump's push to declassify Earhart records follows his decision <span class="link">to release records</span> on the 1960s-era assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr., <span class="link">John F. Kennedy</span> and <span class="link">Robert F. Kennedy</span>. His administration is also under pressure to release records on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

<div class="article-title">Why friends are teaming up to buy homes</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p><em>NPR's series </em><em>Cost of Living: The Price We Pay</em><em> is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out </em><em>this form</em><em> to share your story with NPR.</em></p> <h3 class="edTag">What's the issue?</h3> <p>Home prices</p> <h3 class="edTag">How have housing prices changed since before the pandemic?</h3> <p>They're up 56% since February 2020, according to data from the National Association of Realtors.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Why has the price gone up?</h3> <p>There are too many buyers for too few homes. Several reasons explain the supply shortage, including a lag in home building, rising construction costs and high mortgage rates that discourage current homeowners from moving and giving up their lower rate.</p>
<p>After Hayley Currier and  Tammy Kremer put in an offer on a house, they paced around the backyard of the apartment they shared, nerves jangling.</p> <p>"We've done everything we can," Kremer said.</p> <p>"And all we can do is be anxious at each other," Currier added, before laughing.</p> <p>Currier and Kremer, both in their late 30s, are longtime friends who bonded over their mutual passions for open-water swimming, Jewish rituals and political organizing. They've lived together for the last nine months in a rental in Berkeley, Calif., along with one other roommate.</p>
<p>This shared home has given Currier what she calls "such a beautiful community and feeling of connection and home." It has also confirmed for her that she and Kremer would live well together for the long term.</p>
<p>The ideal arrangement, she says, is that "Tammy and I still have intertwined lives and lives that we get to build together, but just a little bit of private space also."</p> <p>Perhaps a duplex, the two of them thought, or two units on the same plot of land. So in March, they started searching for a place to buy together.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>The draws of co-buying </strong></h3> <p>A significant number of Americans have done what Currier and Kremer are doing. Several housing industry reports from 2024 found that about 15% of homebuyers bought their home with a friend or relative.</p>
<p>Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at the real estate company Redfin, got wind of the growing interest in co-buying through stories from the company's agents. " We've heard of more buyers having to team up to be able to afford a home," she says. " This is a story that we've been hearing really for a long time because affordability just keeps getting worse and worse."</p> <p>Part of the allure of co-buying is that, in an era of rising prices, two wallets are better than one. Home prices have risen more than 50% since 2020.</p>
<p>"Five years ago, the median household would be able to buy a typical home with room to spare," says Kara Ng, a senior economist at the real estate marketplace company Zillow. "Now the median owner would need a $17,000 raise in order to afford a typical home,  and that's assuming they already saved 20% down."</p> <p>In some parts of the U.S., homeownership is even further out of reach. Ng says that in California, the median earner would need a six-figure raise.</p> <p>California happens to be where Currier and Kremer were looking for a home. Like other co-buyers who spoke to NPR, Kremer couldn't afford to buy alone, at least not where she wants to live.</p>
<p>Though housing prices are steep for everyone, Kremer and Currier have an additional economic factor working against them: They're single.</p> <p>"There is a couple's advantage where if you're one person shopping for a home, the amount of listings you can afford is relatively small," says Ng. "But the moment you partner with another person, it unlocks a whole lot of listings for you."</p> <p>According to an analysis from Zillow, a couple in the U.S. earning the median income can afford nearly quadruple the number of listings as an individual buyer can. As Americans increasingly delay or forgo marriage, more and more prospective buyers are on the losing end of the couple's advantage.</p>
<p>Co-buying with a friend or relative is a work-around, allowing people to combine income and assets, especially in areas where the housing stock is mostly single-family homes. "If there were more duplexes or triplexes available, then people would have an easier entry point to be able to afford a home alone," Fairweather says. "But since single-family homes are often the only homes available and they tend to be maybe larger than what an individual might need, it makes more sense to team up with somebody."</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Obstacles to co-buying</strong></h3> <p>When Currier's mother, Sari Currier, first heard about her daughter's plan, she thought, "Oh, this sounds so bad."</p> <p>"It's not something my generation did. You didn't buy property with someone else," she says.</p>
<p>Research backs her up. Surveys show that younger people are more likely to co-buy. Millennial homeowners were more likely to have purchased a home with one or more friends (14%) than Gen X homeowners (4%) or baby boomer homeowners (1%), according to a 2024 survey from the consumer finance company Bankrate. And a 2024 report from the insurance agency JW Surety Bonds found that 70% of Generation Z is willing to co-buy with a friend, the highest of any generation it surveyed.</p> <p>Sari Currier understands that homeownership has become less far affordable for younger people. But she still had concerns about her daughter co-buying with a friend. Unlike married couples, friends don't have built-in legal protections for splitting property if they want to part ways.</p> <p>So she wrote up a list of questions for her daughter and Kremer to discuss — more than two dozen. They include: If one person can't afford the property tax, is the other liable for the whole amount? If a problem inside one unit affects the other, who pays? What happens when one wants to sell the property?</p> <p>Housing experts advise people who co-buy to put an agreement in writing, as Currier and Kremer have done. "Whether you're romantically involved or not romantically involved, you need to plan for those worst-case scenarios," Fairweather says. " You never know what's going to happen if one of you loses your job or one of you needs to move or you decide to break up."</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>Co-buying isn't all about money</strong></h3> <p>Some people don't co-buy solely for financial reasons. They do it for companionship. A 2024 Zillow report found that many buyers chose this route because they didn't want to live alone.</p> <p>That's also true for Kremer. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she'd lived on her own in a studio apartment. "There was something about having my own space that felt like this notion of adulthood, of having made it," she recalls. But she was lonely: " I missed the feeling of coming home to people, and I missed the feeling of sharing food and being in community."</p> <p>That won't be a problem for her anymore. Though Currier and Kremer didn't get the house they bid on this summer, by September they had cause to celebrate. Their offer on another property — two units on one lot, with a shared yard — was accepted. Now, it's possible for them to turn a design idea they'd dreamed up into a reality: stringing tin cans between their units to talk to each other.</p>

<div class="article-title">DACA has bipartisan support in Congress. Still, Republicans are following Trump's lead</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Congressional Republicans are waiting on President Trump to signal he is ready to negotiate a permanent solution for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.</p> <p>Over the last decade, DACA has received varying degrees of support from Republican lawmakers. The program, created in 2012 to protect children who arrived in the country illegally prior to 2007 from deportation, now benefits around half a million people. During the last few months, there have been reports of DACA recipients without criminal records being detained by federal immigration officials despite the protection the program offers from immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>As Trump expands the reach of his mass deportation effort bolstered by record funding from Congress, immigration advocates and Democrats are raising concern that those on DACA may get caught in the crosshairs. Nearly 20 DACA recipients have been detained by immigration officials this year, according to the immigrant rights group Home is Here. But Republican lawmakers open to a solution are still deferring to the executive branch to broker a deal.</p> <p>"I understand they are undocumented. I get it that they broke the law. I get it. But they're needed in the economy and someone gave them a job," said Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Republican from Florida who earlier this year introduced a bill that would provide a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients and others. "President Trump is a guy who gets things done and he can do it. And I am sure that he will come to the realization that this is what's good for America so we can make America greater."</p> <p>Salazar's bill has received bipartisan support. But in interviews with Republican lawmakers who have previously supported a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients, nearly every lawmaker was clear: Trump needs to be the one to start talks.</p>
<p>Trump spent the bulk of the campaign vowing to launch the largest deportation effort in American history. While he has occasionally voiced support for finding a policy solution for certain groups, like farmworkers and other migrant laborers, there has been little effort to do so.</p> <p>"The Trump Administration's top immigration enforcement priority is arresting and removing the dangerous violent, illegal criminal aliens that Joe Biden let flood across our Southern Border – of which there are many," said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson. "America is safer because of President Trump's immigration policies."</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>The DACA coalition has weakened in Congress</strong></h3> <p>In 2017, 34 Republicans signed onto a letter urging then-House Speaker Paul Ryan to pass a permanent fix for DACA after Trump attempted to rescind the program, arguing that "reaching across the aisle to protect DACA recipients…is the right thing to do."</p> <p>But strategists and immigration advocates said that the coalition of Republicans supporting DACA has shrunk over the years, as has the sense of urgency to find a solution after Trump's first attempt to repeal the program failed. Of those 34 Republicans who signed that letter, only eight are still voting members in the House.</p> <p>"Allowing DACA to go forward became a political hot potato for the Republicans," said Muzaffar Chishti, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. "Congress always tries to kick the can down the street."</p>
<p>During his first network interview after winning the election, Trump said he would be open to negotiating a deal for DACA with Democrats. More recently, border czar Tom Homan told reporters at the White House that "no one is prioritizing DACA" for enforcement.</p> <p>On the Hill, strategists said that this early in the administration's tenure, it may be a tall order to envision the cabinet's immigration enforcement leaders at the negotiating table with the Capitol Hill Democrats that would be needed to see a Congressional fix through.</p> <p>"The Trump administration's position is that the only thing that is important on immigration is shutting the border. Almost everything [else] to this administration looks secondary," Chishti said. "As long as that doesn't change as a signal from President Trump, I don't think we're going to see much movement from Republicans in the House or the Senate."</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>House holds out hope on a bipartisan deal</strong></h3> <p>Attempts to work across the aisle can be seen scattered throughout the chamber. The strongest effort is seemingly from Rep. Salazar.</p>
<p>"I have no doubt that we have started a national conversation as to what are we going to do with those people, including the DACA kids, who have roots in the country, who have children, who have been working, paying taxes and do not have a criminal record," Elvira Salazar told NPR in an interview. "That is the national conversation that we need to sit down on the table and specifically the GOP, my party and my president. We can definitely solve it."</p> <p>Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Penn., said his support for DACA has not wavered. A member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, he was joined by fellow caucus members earlier this month to announce the group would provide a framework to hopefully kickstart negotiations on legislation that could include providing a solution to those who have been here for decades.</p> <p>"I look in America and look [at] how immigrants built this country," he said. "So it's really a question for my colleagues as to whether they view America that way."</p>
<p>Separately, earlier this year the caucus sent a letter to the White House requesting a meeting to discuss a bipartisan compromise on immigration. For now, the goal is to come up with a general framework.</p> <p>Still, there needs to be a strong directive from Trump in order to get the process moving, reiterated Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy organization.</p> <p>"The political reality here is he could snap his fingers and tomorrow we'll have an intelligent conversation," Schulte said.</p> <p>Still, any measure also needs bipartisan support in the Senate where enthusiasm is low.</p> <p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., cosponsored the Dream Act in 2024, which would provide a pathway to legal status for people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Speaking at the Capitol with NPR, Graham said he didn't see any of the current efforts making much headway while the priority stays on enforcement.</p>
<p>"If you start legalizing anybody now, that's just another magnet. So I want to turn off the magnets before we do anything," Graham said.</p> <p>Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who introduced measures to provide some pathway to legalization for DACA, said he doesn't see movement before the new year.</p> <p>"I hope the president goes back to what he said in his first term – he thinks there's room for legal immigration and more people immigrating legally here," Tillis said.</p> <p>Sen. John Cornyn, who, in the past spoke strongly about the need to provide a pathway for DACA recipients, said he believes there are others ahead of DACA recipients in terms of the administration's immigration priorities.</p> <p>"These young people who've now grown to be adults have found themselves in a very bad situation but don't see any prospects for immigration bills, including for them, any time soon," Cornyn said. "Thankfully, the border has settled down, but we still have a lot of people in the country who are under final orders of deportation shouldn't be here. And I think at some point, hopefully, we can have that conversation. But I don't think any time soon."</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>KYIV, Ukraine — At least four people were killed when Russia unleashed a barrage of drones and missiles on Ukraine overnight into Sunday, with the capital city of Kyiv suffering the heaviest assault.</p>
<p>This is the first major bombardment since an air attack on Kyiv killed at least 21 people last month.</p> <p>Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Administration, confirmed Sunday's casualties via Telegram, and said 10 others were wounded in the attack that targeted civilian areas across the city. A 12-year-old girl was among the dead. Thick black smoke could be seen rising from a blast near the city center.</p> <p>"The Russians have restarted the child death counter," Tkachenko wrote on Telegram.</p> <p>Writing on X, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the large-scale attacks involved "nearly 500 strike drones and more than 40 missiles."</p>
<p>Besides Kyiv, he said the bombardment targeted the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, and Odesa. According to Zelenskyy, at least 40 people were wounded across the country.</p> <p>Zaporizhzhia's regional head, Ivan Fedorov, said three children were among the 27 wounded in the region, adding that over two dozen buildings were damaged in the region's capital that bears the same name.</p> <p>"This vile attack came virtually (at) the close of UN General Assembly week, and this is exactly how Russia declares its true position. Moscow wants to keep fighting and killing, and it deserves the toughest pressure from the world," Zelenskyy wrote.</p>
<p>Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov insisted to world leaders Saturday that his nation doesn't intend to attack Europe but will mount a "decisive response" to any aggression.</p> <p>The strikes that began overnight and continued after dawn on Sunday also targeted residential buildings, civilian infrastructure, a medical facility and a kindergarten, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, who also said damage was reported at more than 20 locations across the capital.</p> <p>At Kyiv's central train station, passengers arrived to the crackle of anti-aircraft gunfire and the low buzz of attack drones. Mostly women, they waited quietly in a platform underpass until the air raid alert ended. Parents checked the news on their phones while children played online games.</p>
<p>"The sky has turned black again," said one woman at the station, who gave only her first name, Erika. "It's happening a lot."</p>
<p>At a multi-story residential building heavily damaged by a drone attack, a large section of the upper floors was gutted and windows blown out. Emergency services personnel, including firefighters with an extended ladder truck, used power saws to clear the debris. Piles of glass littered nearby sidewalks as building residents, some looking shaken, sat on benches.</p> <p>Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha described the scope of the assault as involving "hundreds of drones and missiles." "We must maximise the cost of further escalation for Russia," Sybiha said, writing on X.</p> <p>Russian officials did not immediately comment on the attacks.</p> <p>The assault also triggered military responses in neighboring Poland, where fighter jets were deployed early Sunday morning as Russia struck targets in western Ukraine, according to the Polish armed forces.</p> <p>Polish military officials characterized these defensive measures as "preventative."</p> <p>International concerns have mounted recently that the fighting could spread beyond Ukraine's borders as European countries rebuked Russia for what they said were provocations. The incidents have included Russian drones landing on Polish soil and Russian fighter aircraft entering Estonian airspace.</p> <p>Russia denied its planes entered Estonian airspace and said none of its drones targeted Poland.</p> <p>The latest bombardment follows President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's announcement Saturday of what he called a "mega deal" for weapons purchases from the United States. The $90 billion package includes both the major arms agreement and a separate "drone deal" for Ukrainian-made drones that the U.S. will purchase directly.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 41 Ukrainian drones overnight into Sunday.<br/></p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>NEW DELHI — A stampede at a rally for a popular Indian actor and politician in the southern state of Tamil Nadu killed at least 36 people and injured 40 others, the state's health minister said late Saturday.</p> <p>Ma Subramanian told The Associated Press that the victims were dead by the time they were taken to a hospital and that the injured were stable. The dead included eight children, Subramanian said.</p> <p>The rally, which officials say was attended by tens of thousands of people, was being addressed by Vijay, one of Tamil Nadu's most successful actors-turned-politician in the district of Karur.</p>
<p>Indian media reports, quoting local officials, said as Vijay spoke to the surging crowd, a group of his supporters and fans fell while trying to get close to his bus, causing the stampede. Supporters had gathered at the political rally amid intensely hot temperatures and Vijay arrived hours late, officials said.</p> <p>"There was indiscipline" at the rally, Subramanian said, adding that an investigation had been ordered.</p> <p>Quoting officials, the Press Trust of India news agency reported that at least 30 people fainted while Vijay was addressing the rally from atop his campaign vehicle and were rushed in ambulances to area hospitals. He halted his speech mid-way when workers raised alarm after noticing that people were fainting and falling, it said, adding that as they were removed to hospitals, Vijay continued his speech.</p> <p>However, he ended his speech shortly after sensing an abnormal situation in a section of the huge gathering, the news agency said.</p> <p>Hours after the accident, Vijay offered his condolences.</p> <p>"My heart is shattered," he posted on X. "I am writhing in unbearable, indescribable pain and sorrow that words cannot express."</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the "unfortunate incident" was "deeply saddening."</p> <p>My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones. Wishing strength to them in this difficult time. Praying for a swift recovery to all those injured," he said on social media.</p>
<p>In southern Indian states, particularly Tamil Nadu, some film stars have larger than life status, rooted in the ancient Tamil culture of hero worship and image worship. Many have become politicians and some have even been given divine status.</p> <p>In 2024, Vijay retired from acting and launched his own political party. It was unclear whether he plans to run for office in Tamil Nadu state.</p> <p>Stampedes are relatively common in India when large crowds gather. In January, at least 30 people were killed as tens of thousands of Hindus rushed to bathe in a sacred river during the Maha Kumbh festival, the world's largest religious gathering.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">UN imposes 'snapback' sanctions on a hungrier, poorer and more anxious Iran</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The United Nations reimposed sanctions on Iran early Sunday over its nuclear program, further squeezing the Islamic Republic as its people increasingly find themselves priced out of the food they need to survive and worried about their futures.</p>
<p>The sanctions will again freeze Iranian assets abroad, halt arms deals with Tehran, and penalize any development of Iran's ballistic missile program, among other measures. It came via a mechanism known as "snapback," included in Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, and comes as Iran's economy already is reeling.</p> <p>Iran's rial currency sits at a record low, increasing pressure on food prices and making daily life that much more challenging. That includes meat, rice and other staples of the Iranian dinner table.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, people worry about a new round of fighting between Iran and Israel — as well as potentially the United States — as missile sites struck during the 12-day war in June now appear to be being rebuilt.</p> <p>Activists fear a rising wave of repression within the Islamic Republic, which already has reportedly executed more people this year than over the past three decades.</p>
<p>Sina, the father of a 12-year-old boy who spoke on condition that only his first name be used for fear of repercussions, said the country has never faced such a challenging time, even during the deprivations of the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and the decades of sanctions that came later.</p> <p>"For as long as I can remember, we've been struggling with economic hardship, and every year it's worse than the last," Sina told The Associated Press. "For my generation, it's always either too late or too early — our dreams are slipping away."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Iran sanctions set to 'snapback'</h3> <p>Snapback was designed to be veto-proof at the U.N. Security Council, meaning China and Russia could not stop it alone, as they have other proposed actions against Tehran in the past. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called them a "trap" for Iran on Saturday.</p>
<p>France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered snapback over Iran 30 days ago for its further restricting monitoring of its nuclear program and the deadlock over its negotiations with the U.S.</p> <p>Iran further withdrew from the International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring after Israel's war with the country in June, which also saw the U.S. strike nuclear sites in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, the country still maintains a stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% purity — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90% — that is largely enough to make several atomic bombs, should Tehran choose to rush toward weaponization.</p>
<p>Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, though the West and IAEA say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003.</p>
<p>The three European nations on Sunday said they "continuously made every effort to avoid triggering snapback." But Iran "has not authorized IAEA inspectors to regain access to Iran's nuclear sites, nor has it produced and transmitted to the IAEA a report accounting for its stockpile of high-enriched uranium."</p> <p>Tehran has further argued that the three European nations shouldn't be allowed to implement snapback, pointing in part to America's unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018, during the first term of President Donald Trump's administration.</p> <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised the three European nations for "an act of decisive global leadership" for imposing the sanctions on Iran and said "diplomacy is still an option."</p> <p>"For that to happen, Iran must accept direct talks," Rubio said.</p> <p>However, it remains unclear how Tehran will respond Sunday.</p> <p>"The Trump administration appears to think it has a stronger hand post-strikes, and it can wait for Iran to come back to the table," said Kelsey Davenport, a nuclear expert at the Washington-based Arms Control Association. "Given the knowledge Iran has, given the materials that remain in Iran, that's a very dangerous assumption."</p> <p>Risks also remain for Iran as well, she added: "In the short term, kicking out the IAEA increases the risk of miscalculation. The U.S. or Israel could use the lack of inspections as a pretext for further strikes."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Hunger and anxiety grow in Iran</h3> <p>The aftermath of the June war drove up food prices in Iran, putting already expensive meat out of reach for poorer families.</p>
<p>Iran's government put overall annual inflation at 34.5% in June, and its Statistical Center reported that the cost of essential food items rose over 50% over the same period. But even that doesn't reflect what people see at shops. Pinto beans tripled in price in a year, while butter nearly doubled. Rice, a staple, rose more than 80% on average, hitting 100% for premium varieties. Whole chicken is up 26%, while beer and lamb are up 9%.</p>
<p>"Every day I see new higher prices for cheese, milk and butter," said Sima Taghavi, a mother of two, at a Tehran grocery. "I cannot omit them like fruits and meat from my grocery list because my kids are too young to be deprived."</p> <p>The pressure over food and fears about the war resuming have seen more patients heading to psychologists since June, local media in Iran have reported.</p> <p>"The psychological pressure from the 12-day war on the one hand, and runaway inflation and price hikes on the other, has left society exhausted and unmotivated," Dr. Sima Ferdowsi, a clinical psychologist and professor at Shahid Beheshti University, told the Hamshahri newspaper in an interview published in July.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Executions surge in 2025</h3> <p>Iran has faced multiple nationwide protests in recent years, fueled by anger over the economy, demands for women's rights and calls for the country's theocracy to change.</p> <p>In response to those protests and the June war, Iran has been putting prisoners to death at a pace unseen since 1988, when it executed thousands at the end of the Iran-Iraq war. The Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights and the Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran put the number of people executed in 2025 at over 1,000, noting the number could be higher as Iran does not report on each execution.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Wyoming town erects new monument to violent, anti-immigrant history</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>ROCK SPRINGS, WYO — Towering plateaus dotted with sage brush and roaming wild horses surround the desert town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, with a population of about 23,000.</p> <p>A short drive from Main Street, two rectangular holes form a checkerboard pattern in a grassy lawn connecting a Catholic church with a nearby schoolyard. Six Grinnell College researchers spent the summer here digging, scraping and screening the soil, most of whom have never been to Wyoming before.</p> <p>The Iowa-based researchers are looking for artifacts from when a mob burned down what was once the Rock Springs Chinatown.</p> <p>In 1885, labor tensions boiled over in the Union Pacific Railroad's coal mines, stemming from an argument over who had the best work opportunities. The mob, many of them European migrants, blamed the Chinese.</p>
<p>"And it was right here where we're standing," said Professor Laura Ng, from four feet deep in the trenches of the dig site, where she's guiding students mapping diagrams of burnt down building foundations.</p> <p>After burning several blocks once made up of homes and shops, the mob killed 28 Chinese people and injured another 14, in what is one of the deadliest incidents of anti-Chinese violence in U.S. history.</p> <p>"[Because of this], there's going to be a layer that is very distinctive in the archaeological record," said Ng.</p>
<p>In what she refers to as the "burn layer," Ng's team has found artifacts, ranging from pottery sherds, animal bones, an ornamental door handle and a wooden beam from an old building.</p> <p>The town dates back to the 1860s, when Union Pacific's nearby coal deposits lured thousands of immigrant laborers to the mines and railyards as the company neared the completion of the transcontinental railroad.</p> <p>As a result, Rock Springs has long proudly called itself the "Home of 56 nationalities." It's had an International Day celebration for more than a hundred years.</p> <p><strong>Rock Springs turns a corner </strong></p> <p>But now, the town is digging up this part of its migrant history and finding new ways to shed light on a dark moment in its past.</p>
<p>A new statue was dedicated this fall to mark the 140th anniversary commemoration already memorializing the 55 other nationalities whose labor in the coal mines also built the town.</p> <p>Until recently, Rock Springs' main monument was a small plaque fixed to a boulder to recognize the 28 killed in the massacre. But it sits on a grassy median, turned away from the road that passes by the site of the old Chinatown, making it easy to miss.</p> <p>Over Labor Day weekend, the town unveiled a much more prominent monument to commemorate the 140th anniversary.</p> <p>"[The] bronze statue 'Requiem,' standing more than seven feet tall, depicts a Chinese miner amidst the ruins of Chinatown, holding the remnants of a ceremonial dragon flag," Rock Springs Mayor Max Mickelson read during the statue dedication. He was joined by his town council, which for the most part, supported the statue.</p> <p>The town's growing acknowledgement of its past comes at an odd time for a county that voted 76% for the president in 2024, which since being reelected has tried to erase negative depictions of the country's past.</p> <p>Local students, who now learn about the massacre at school, helped host the more than 200 attendees at the statue ceremony while the county's two history museums helped fundraise for the statue.</p> <p>A memorial like this one is long overdue, according to the mayor.</p> <p>At the same time, he acknowledges the irony of honoring the town's migrant history while Sweetwater County, home to Rock Springs, cracks down and renews contracts with ICE, the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Wyoming's state highway patrol and National Guard followed suit earlier this summer.<br/>"As someone who is a descendant of immigrants that came to this country from Europe, I find it very frustrating that as a country we have decided to take an anti-immigrant stance," Mickelson said.</p>
<p>Like 76% of the county he lives in, Mickelson voted for President Trump in 2024. But he said the crackdown wasn't what he voted for.</p> <p>"We have real problem areas where those resources would be better put than tracking down somebody who is here working, putting up stucco," Mickelson said.</p> <p>He'd rather see resources directed toward the drug and human tracking that have recently plagued his town.</p> <p>As a self-dubbed "Old School Republican" and a critic of the president's immigration policies, Mickelson said it's an awkward time to be a member of the party.</p> <p>The mayor has several friends who migrated to Rock Springs as teenagers and have since received citizenship. Immigrant labor is still important to his town, which now relies on mining the mineral trona, used in baking soda, trona mining rather than coal, with just under 20% of residents Hispanic or Latino, according to the Census Bureau.</p> <p>"We don't love America any more than those people. They worked really hard to get here," Mickelson said.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Descendants of the massacre join the commemoration</strong></h3> <p>This summer, Ricky and Grace Leo returned to their hometown of Rock Springs to join the archaeology dig.</p>
<p>Despite growing up there, it wasn't until 2019 that the couple learned about the massacre — and that they have ties to it.</p> <p>"We didn't know that we were related to the people that died in the massacre," Grace said.<br/>The massacre wasn't something the couple learned about when they attended the local high school.</p> <p>A chance run in with Rock Springs archaeologist Dudley Gardner at a history conference, considered one of the experts on the massacre and western Chinatowns, turned into the Leos later becoming one of the hosts of this fall's commemoration.</p> <p>At the Labor Day ceremony honoring those who died in the massacre, traditional lion dancers performed and visitors from across the country recited the names of those killed with traditional blessings. The Leo family organized lectures, ceremonial blessing rituals and cooking demonstrations ahead of the unveiling of the statue.</p>
<p>Ng has also made the effort to reach out to the descendants of the massacre and the survivors. At least five made it to the ceremony,<em> </em>the majority of whom had never heard about the massacre until recently.</p> <p>Robert Lew, who lives in California, was one of them.</p> <p>He knew his father grew up orphaned in Rock Springs. But only learned at 75 years old, after talking with the archaeologists, that his ancestors also made a life in the Wyoming town much earlier.</p> <p>"In terms of [learning about] my great-grandfather and 1885 in the massacre, that was only two weeks ago, three weeks ago," Lew said. His daughter Beth Lew-Williams is an esteemed scholar of Chinese-American history.</p> <p>While here, Lew talked with a young man from Rock Springs, who said he was glad to see his community become more familiar with the massacre.</p> <p>"It's just amazing, very inspirational," Lew said, "And made me feel really good about our country."<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">George E. Hardy, Tuskegee Airman, dies at 100</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Lt. Col. George E. Hardy, the last surviving member of the Tuskegee Airmen who flew combat missions during WWII in Europe, has died. He was 100 years old.</p> <p>Hardy died on Thursday, a spokesperson for Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., told NPR on Saturday. The organization remembered his legacy as one of "courage, resilience, tremendous skill and dogged perseverance against racism, prejudice and other evils, in a social media post on Friday.</p>
<p>"Colonel Hardy was an amazing man. He was a patriot. He loved his family. He loved his community. He loved our organization," Leon Butler Jr., national president of Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., told NPR on Saturday. "He worked very hard. He worked tirelessly to preserve the legacy, not for himself, but for those that he served with, and he cared about the families of other original Tuskegee Airmen."</p> <p>Born on June 8, 1925 in Philadelphia, he joined the U.S. Army Air Corps at age 18 in July 1943 and started pilot training at the Tuskegee Army Air Field in December of that year. He graduated from pilot training in September 1944 at age 19, and was commissioned a second lieutenant.</p>
<p>During World War II, he was part of the 332nd Fighter Group at Ramitelli Air Base, Italy and assigned to the 99th Fighter Squadron. He completed 21 missions across Europe, according to the U.S. Air Force. He was the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot with the Tuskegee Airmen, the first Black aviators of the U.S. Armed Forces, according to the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc.</p> <p>Hardy recalled during an interview with the Veterans History Project that while he was stationed in Italy he did not encounter the systemic racism that he did while in the states but there was still segregation.</p>
<p>"We had our own club in Naples…so you didn't go to the White club," he said in the interview. "That's…the way life was."</p> <p>He left Italy as a first lieutenant when the war in Europe ended in 1945 and returned to the Tuskegee Army Air Field base where he was a supervising pilot until 1946 when it closed. He then went back home to Philadelphia before attending New York University and getting married in 1947.</p> <p>Hardy was assigned to the 19th Bomb Group, where he was the only Black American officer, and sent to Guam in 1949. The following year, the Korean War began and he was transferred to Okinawa. During the Korean War, Hardy flew 45 combat missions and would again take to the skies in a conflict for the Vietnam War, where he flew 70 combat missions, according to the U.S. Air Force.</p>
<p>He retired from military service in 1971, according to an interview with AVI-8's The Aviation Journal.</p> <p>Hardy received numerous honors for his military service, including the Distinguished Flying Cross with Valor, a Commendation Medal with one Oak Leaf Cluster and an Air Medal with 11 Oak Leaf Clusters. In 2007, he and other Tuskegee Airmen were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.</p> <p>While he was proud of his military service, his education was his greatest achievement, Butler Jr. said.</p> <p>He graduated from South Philadelphia High School and received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and a master's degree in systems engineering-reliability from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology, according to the U.S. Air Force. Hardy also received an honorary doctorate of public service from Tuskegee University, the U.S. Air Force said.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Saudi Arabia is not known as a center for comedy. But through Oct. 9, the country's capital, Riyadh, is hosting dozens of A-list comedians — many of them American — at the first ever Riyadh Comedy Festival.</p> <p>The participation of big-name funnymen, including Dave Chappelle, Aziz Ansari, Kevin Hart and Jimmy Carr, has provoked criticism from fellow comedians, including Marc Maron, Shane Gillis and Stavros Halkias, as well as human rights groups and other commentators.</p> <p>"The Saudi government is using the Riyadh Comedy Festival … to deflect attention from its brutal repression of free speech and other pervasive human rights violations," said Human Rights Watch in a statement this week. "Participating comedians, to avoid contributing to laundering the Saudi government's reputation, should use the comedy festival to publicly urge Saudi authorities to free unjustly detained Saudi dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists."</p>
<p>A recent U.S. State Department report on Saudi Arabia's human rights record in 2024 listed abuses including "arbitrary or unlawful killings, disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, and serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom," among other issues.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Comedians' spat</h3> <p>In a video on Maron's Instagram channel, the WTF podcast host took aim at colleagues who signed up to perform at the festival, while referencing the allegations of the Saudi government's possible involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks and its role in the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p> <p>"From the folks that brought you 9/11. Two weeks of laughter in the desert, don't miss it!'" joked Maron acerbically. "The same guy that's gonna pay them is the same guy that paid that guy to bone-saw Jamal Khashoggi and put him in a f***ing suitcase. But don't let that stop the yucks, it's gonna be a good time!"</p> <p>Gillis and Halkias were both invited to perform at this event, which was announced in July by General Entertainment Authority chairman Turki Alalshikh. On his podcast, Gillis said he declined a "significant bag" to perform at the event. "I took a principled stand," he said. In a podcast conversation with Chris DiStefano, Halkias said "Can't do it."</p>
<p>Fellow comedian DiStefano, conversely, told Halkias he accepted the invitation: "I didn't want to do it either," he said, adding that it was his wife who urged him to take the money.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Saudi Arabia's play</h3> <p>NPR reached out to representatives of nearly every participating comedian for comment, as well as the Saudi embassy in Washington, D.C., and the country's General Entertainment Authority. No one had responded by the time of publication. However, in its statement announcing the event, the General Entertainment Authority described the festival as "the largest of its kind globally," adding that it "reflects the efforts to amplify Riyadh's status as a leading destination for major cultural and artistic events."</p> <p>As a nation heavily dependent on oil, Saudi Arabia is currently engaged in a plan to diversify itself economically, socially and culturally. Its Vision 2030 program, implemented in 2016, encompasses efforts to increase the country's visibility on the cultural stage. "Vision 2030 is a blueprint that is diversifying the economy, empowering citizens, creating a vibrant environment for both local and international investors, and establishing Saudi Arabia as a global leader," the website states.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A history of pushback </h3> <p>The Riyadh Comedy Festival isn't the first time artists have inspired blowback for accepting invitations to participate in events in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Big name pop music acts including Mariah Carey, The Black Eyed Peas and Justin Bieber all earned criticism for opting to perform in the country in recent years. "Doesn't she know Saudi Arabia is one of the most repressive and murderous regimes on the planet?" wrote the activism group Code Pink in a 2019 statement calling for Carey to cancel her show that year.</p> <p>And American visual artists who've exhibited their work at Desert X AlUla, a spinoff of the U.S. Desert X art festival in the Saudi Arabian desert, as well as the event's organizers, have also received criticism. In a 2019 article, <em>Los Angeles Times </em>art critic Christopher Knight called the show "morally corrupt." Knight added: "Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy built on theocratic law. Free expression is forbidden. Illegal. A criminal act."</p>
<p>Comedian Tim Dillon said on his podcast last month that he signed up for financial reasons. He said he had been offered "a large sum of money" — $375,000 for one performance — and said that other comedians had been offered as much as $1.6 million. He told his detractors to "get over it," adding, "So what if they have slaves, they're paying me enough to look the other way."</p> <p>But in an episode of the Tim Dillon Podcast last week, the comedian announced he'd been removed from the lineup for the comments he made about the country's record on slavery. (NPR reached out to Saudi's General Entertainment Authority for verification, but has not yet heard back.) "I addressed it in a funny way and they fired me," Dillon said on his podcast. "I certainly wasn't gonna show up in your country and insult the people that are paying me the money."</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>DALLAS – Stephany Gauffeny rubs her pregnant belly as she sits on a brown leather chair inside a law office. She's tired and worried.</p> <p>Gauffeny can go into labor any time now. But instead of preparing for this moment – the birth of her fifth child – she's anguished about her husband Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez.</p> <p>He's on life support after being critically injured on Wednesday in the shooting at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas. He was being detained there after being arrested on Aug. 8 for driving under the influence. He is in the U.S. without legal status.</p>
<p>"It hurts to think like, what if he never even gets to meet him," Gauffeny told NPR on Saturday, referring to her unborn child, a son.</p> <p>That is very possible.</p> <p>Gauffeny said that the medical personnel at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas told her on Friday evening Garcia-Hernandez might not survive the night. As of Saturday afternoon, machines were keeping him alive.</p> <p>One of the things that shocked her the most when she saw Garcia-Hernandez in the hospital was how he looked.</p> <p>"When I first arrived at the hospital, he was shackled, even though he couldn't move," Gauffeny said. He's still unconscious, but because he remains in ICE custody, agents are controlling access to his room.</p> <p>All of this is making it harder for her to visit her husband, and for his brothers to see him, too.</p>
<p>In addition to Garcia-Hernandez, Venezuelan detainee Jose Andres Bordones-Molina was also injured in the shooting. A third was killed, and the Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office identified him as 37-year-old Norlan Guzman Fuentes, from El Salvador.</p> <p>In a statement to NPR, ICE confirmed the identities of all three victims on Saturday. The agency said that all three were "criminal illegal aliens."</p> <p>The shooter was identified by ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons as Joshua Jahn, a 29-year-old who died of self-inflicted wounds. According to law enforcement officials, the man sought to "terrorize" ICE agents. However, none of the victims were law enforcement officers. Instead, all of the victims were detainees, according to the government.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">'He's a great dad'</h3> <p>Gauffeny said the government's long delay identifying the victims is what made her want to tell the world more about who her husband is.</p> <p>"I want his name to be known," Gauffeny said. "I want people to know who he really was. He wasn't just an immigrant or a detainee, or a criminal." She said that she hoped this incident prompted more security to be put in at ICE immigration facilities to protect those inside.</p> <p>Garcia-Hernandez, 31, is originally from Mexico, and has lived in the U.S. since he was a teenager. He doesn't have legal status, his wife said, but based on the fact that she was a U.S. citizen, they were trying to get him permanent residency.</p>
<p>She told NPR Garcia-Hernandez had a great sense of humor, always making people laugh. He was always helping people – from those in need in the streets, to his family members and friends. He'd give people rides, help fix their cars, help them with household tasks like hanging TVs.</p> <p>And he always worried about his family and took care of her. Even while in detention, he would ask her whether anyone was helping her cut the grass at their new home.</p> <p>She said he worked as a house painter before he was detained, and would often surprise her by coming home from work with her favorite snacks, including elotes.</p> <p>They met when they were 15 years old, and started dating when they were around 19. They've been married for a decade.</p> <p>And he loved being a dad, she said. Together they were raising four kids, ages 3, 8, 12, and 14.</p> <p>"He spoiled them a lot … and they miss him," Gauffeny said.</p> <p>Gauffeny has not told the kids what happened to Garcia-Hernandez. She's hoping for her husband to get better, although she acknowledges that is nearly impossible.</p>
<p>The kids are noticing her absence – she spends most of her days at the hospital. She's allowed to visit her husband for a few hours in the morning and the evening.</p> <p>And she's also worried about how she'll provide for her kids since Garcia-Hernandez was the main source of income. The family is now relying on a GoFundMe campaign to pay for groceries and bills.</p> <p>"Before he got arrested … he had told me, 'Okay, my next paycheck, you know, we're gonna go out and buy the baby all this stuff,'" she said. "And, you know, it never happened."</p>

<div class="article-title">'The cases swung, not me': Ex-Justice Kennedy reflects on a changing Supreme Court</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>In the decades I have covered the Supreme Court, I have read lots of books written by justices, and with a couple of notable exceptions, they are…sigh, pretty boring. </p> <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, however, has written a very interesting book — "Life, Law, &amp; Liberty," scheduled for release Oct. 14 — because he reveals more than usual about himself and his 30 years of service on the nation's highest court — a period of time in which he was often the "swing justice" whose vote was determinative in controversial cases ranging from same-sex marriage to, campaign finance, affirmative action, and  abortion.</p>
<p>Kennedy and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor for much of their overlapping tenures represented the ideological center of the court at a time when the institution became increasingly conservative. Interestingly, both justices were products of the West, much like the President who appointed them, Ronald Reagan. And both justices viewed their Western origins as essential to the their personalities and views. Both started out as pretty firm conservatives, but eventually saw the court transform into a far more conservative group of justices. Or as Kennedy puts it in his book, "The cases swung, not me."</p> <p><strong>Concerned about the country </strong></p> <p>In an interview with NPR to be aired in October, Kennedy said that he is "very worried" about America today. </p> <p>"We live in an era where reasoned, thoughtful, rational, respectful discourse has been replaced by antagonistic, confrontational conversation," he said, adding that "Democracy is not guaranteed to survive." </p> <p>Indeed, he says that he is worried even about the tone of some Supreme Court opinions. </p> <p>"It seems to me the idea of partisanship is becoming much more prevalent and more bitter," he said. "And my concern is that the court in its own opinions…has to be asked to moderate and become much more respectful."</p>
<p>When he retired from the court in 2018, Kennedy told a small group of journalists that he was confident that the court's major decisions would remain intact. But when I asked him if he still thinks that is true, he demurred.</p>
<p>Though Kennedy, in close cases, voted most often with the court's conservatives, perhaps most revealing in the book are his accounts of how and why he cast decisive votes with the court's liberals on abortion and same-sex marriage. Of the two issues, it turns out that same-sex marriage was easier for Kennedy to resolve, but harder on his relationship with his conservative colleague, Justice Antonin Scalia.</p> <p><strong>Gay marriage decision</strong> </p> <p>Starting in 1996 Kennedy wrote every major decision about gay rights, culminating in 2015 when he wrote the court's majority opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges declaring that same-sex couples must be allowed to marry everywhere in the country. </p> <p>"No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family," he wrote.</p>
<p>Kennedy says that perhaps the most persuasive argument for gay marriage came with his realization that many states barred gay couples from adoptions, so that only one could be the legal parent, and the other had no legal right to make decisions for the child, sign school papers for the child, in some cases could not visit the child in the hospital, and the children could not say they had two parents, which was "terribly demeaning for the children of gay parents." </p> <p>That was the situation faced by "hundreds of thousands of children of gay parents," he observed in our interview. "That was eye-opening for me, and it was very important in influencing me for the result."</p> <p>It was the gay marriage cases, however, that for almost a year led to a rupture with his colleague, Justice Antonin Scalia. The break came over Scalia's dissenting opinion in the same-sex marriage case in which he wrote that if ever he were to join an opinion like Kennedy's "I would hide my head in a bag." According to Kennedy, the other conservatives thought the dissent "offensive" and "intemperate" and tried to get Scalia to modify it. But they failed, prompting Chief Justice John Roberts to write the lead dissent.<br/>Kennedy says that while he was able to "shrug off" the Scalia dissent, his children and their spouses "were devastated" by its tone." And by the beginning of the next term Scalia, known to all as Nino, "rarely came to lunch" with his colleagues and no longer stopped by Kennedy's chambers to chat.</p>
<p>Months went by and then one day in February of 2016 Scalia "came down the long corridor of the court to my chambers to talk." Once there, "he turned to the subject on both our minds: our own relationship. Nino said he had come to regret deeply his Obergefell dissent" and he apologized for being intemperate. "The visit became a pleasure, even a landmark for us," writes Kennedy. "Neither of us was big on hugging but we hugged, both of us smiling." </p> <p>Scalia was leaving shortly for a hunting trip in Texas, but the two men pledged that when he returned, they and their wives would get together again. Kennedy recalls that he told Scalia not to overschedule himself, and Scalia promised that this would be his last long trip.</p> <p>Those parting words were the last they ever spoke to each other. About a week later, Scalia died in his sleep while on that hunting trip. "If friendships are slipping away, we must renew them soon, lest time does not permit us to celebrate them for long," Kennedy writes.</p> <p><strong>Record on abortion</strong> </p> <p>The other emotional legal issue that Kennedy talks about in the book is abortion. A devout and Mass-attending Catholic, Kennedy then, as now, views abortion as a moral wrong. And at one point he was so conflicted that he even considered resigning. "Another life is involved, one that cannot speak for itself. For many of us the unborn child cries out from the womb, cries out with a soulful voice to us and the law: let me exist, let me live," he writes.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, he concluded that "a moral wrong is not necessarily a legal wrong, nor do my own personal views control what I must decide as a judge." As a co-author of the decision that upheld the right to abortion, he writes, "The constitution promises…a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter" and among those decisions, the mother's choice to bear a child is among the most personal known to our law."</p>
<p>The abortion decision that Kennedy co-authored is exhibit A of his opposition to the doctrine that today dominates the conservative Supreme Court: originalism. Six members of the court to a large degree have embraced the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted by following the words in the Constitution at the time the it was ratified, and in some cases the way it was interpreted after the post-Civil War amendments to the Constitution guaranteeing equal protection of the law.</p> <p><strong>Views on originalism</strong> </p> <p>Kennedy has a different view. </p> <p>"Liberty must be understood over time," he said in our interview, adding that it helps little to do what originalists do, refer to dictionaries of the 1700s to figure out what the meaning of the Constitution was at the time it was adopted. In the book, he leads the section on liberty by quoting from his same-sex marriage opinion: "The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning."</p> <p>Or as he puts in in the book, "In my view the framers of the constitution were not so self assured as to think they knew what the spacious term 'liberty' should mean in all its reach. If they had been certain, they would have written a more detailed explanation" but the Framers were "cautious enough and modest enough" that they "intentionally chose capacious terms that would inspire and protect freedom."</p> <p><strong>A man of the American West </strong></p> <p>While some conservative scholars are less than kind to Kennedy over his changes of heart on some issues, for others it may be somehow reassuring to hear his account of those changes of mind. How, for instance, he initially thought that juvenile killers should be eligible for the death penalty, but later changed his mind for a variety of reasons, among them that the U.S. was among fewer than a handful of nations to permit such punishment. And because studies of the brain indicate that "the urge to act without thinking is much more prevalent among minors."</p>
<p>Even as much of Kennedy's book is serious, there are some hilarious moments, too. My favorite is the red emergency phone in his chambers that never rang. Then one day it did. It was a prisoner in Ohio, who somehow had gotten the telephone number. The court police quickly said they would change the number, but Kennedy said he enjoyed the occasional chats with the prisoner, who told the justice which rulings he agreed with and which ones he disapproved of.</p> <p>There is a great deal more in Kennedy's book—about his family, the court, his upbringing in Sacramento, Calif., in the '30s and '40s, and about his father, who took the unpopular position of opposing the Japanese internment during World War II. Kennedy, who at 89, is still a tall strapping man, was by his telling, a sickly kid whose father and mother taught him to read at an early age,  and had him read Shakespeare aloud in the car when he was less than 10 years old.</p> <p>After his father died unexpectedly in 1963, Kennedy, who had just begun his legal career in San Francisco, moved back to his family home in Sacramento to take over his father's law practice. He was just 27 years old, and would remain in the place he loved for another 25 years. At age 38 he became the youngest federal appeals court judge in the country, but left Sacramento only when appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1988.</p> <p>In those days, Kennedy observes, Sacramento was a small town of about 130,000 people, and through his eyes, you can almost smell the air, see the scenery and feel the West. Those are the poetic parts of the book.</p> <p><em>Nina Totenberg has covered the Supreme Court for NPR since 1975</em> </p>
