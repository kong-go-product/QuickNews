<div class="article-title">Bill Maher explores connection between internet memes and recent political violence</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>"Real Time" host Bill Maher asked an internet culture researcher Friday about memes to understand how people get "inspired to kill." </p><p>Memes, or "historical documents" with various interpretations, were engraved on the shell casings of late Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk’s suspected assassin, "Real Time" guest Aidan Walker said.</p><p>Kirk’s accused killer etched gamer-inspired and antifascist messaging on his casings, including, "Hey, fascist! Catch!" and a reference to a World War II anthem.</p><p>"But [memes] take on new meanings, I mean this is part of why people get inspired to kill," Maher said. "Because they get insulted by them, right? They get hurt by them. They have a meaning that a lot of us older people are not getting, correct?" </p><p>The discussion came in the wake of Wednesday’s deadly shooting at a Dallas I.C.E. facility, where one detainee was killed, and two others were wounded before the shooter took his own life. The gunman reportedly left behind a bullet casing inscribed with the phrase "anti-ICE." </p><p>He was almost "murdering ironically," Maher considered. </p><p>"I mean, that’s a place society has never been," Maher continued. "Yes, young men are bad and fumbling to get women to agree to what they want to do. But it was never like this. We never had the term incel [involuntarily celibate]." </p><p>A lot of memes can also be ironic, Walker explained.</p><p>"In a way it’s a little bit like dog whistle…they’re so layered in, you know, I don’t really mean this, but you can put this sort of anti-social or hateful idea behind that," he described.</p><p>The 26-year-old researcher attributed problematic anti-social behavior to not just an affordability crisis but a "crisis of meaning." </p><p>"You have a lot of especially young people who don’t see a future for themselves, who feel lonely, who feel alienated," he discussed. "And they congregate in these online spaces sort of outside of the mainstream where they feel like that online world is more important than their real world."</p><p>Walker went on to share "the way out" that he says gives him hope.</p><p>"It’s giving people those social bonds… giving everybody the shot at dignity and the shot at being seen in our culture," he said. </p><p>While Republicans like Vice President JD Vance blame "left-wing political radicalization"for recentviolence, Maher didn’t mince words in his closing monologue for those arguing the Left is "more approving" of it:</p><p>"You keep saying the Left is more approving of political violence – well who do you think that’s going to be aimed at?" Maher asked. "I know it feels exhilarating to make the liberals cry their liberal tears after they made you feel disrespected and looked down on flown over and called the nutty ones. But come on, I thought you were the tough guys. Get over it."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Volunteer pilots reflect on one year since Helene devastated western North Carolina</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>It's been one year since Helene devastated parts of the region in Western North Carolina and some of the first eyes-in-the-sky are reflecting on the devastation that followed. </p><p>Without cell service and washed-out roads, hundreds of people were left stranded in the mountains. </p><p>Al Mattress, a helicopter pilot with a commercial flight company, Total Flight Solutions, said he received an early morning call from one of the company's clients. The client asked them to check on a family member in western North Carolina. </p><p>Mattress says he got up in the air as quickly as he could. He was one of the first to see what was actually going on in the region.</p><p>"Watching it unfold, ya know, this water was still rising," Mattress tells FOX. "I had gotten there personally, literally, right after the storm left."</p><p>Mattress did a couple missions checking on loved ones and realized the destruction was worse than anyone thought. Back on the ground was Total Flight Solutions helicopter pilot, Tim Grant. Grant laid out the logistics for dozens of pilots in the coming weeks as missions switched from rescues to donation drops. </p><p>With support from the United Cajun Navy, Grant says they brought in nearly every helicopter they could. Everyone donated their time, effort and resources to immediately rescue people, or drop off essentials like medicine. </p><p>Mattress talked to FOX about the reactions and conversations he had with some of the people he rescued.</p><p>"No phones, ya know the phone they have, it's till the battery goes dead. They don’t know. They can’t call, they don’t know anybody is coming for them."</p><p>"When they [the pilots] would get done with their mission, they would climb high enough to find a cell phone tower that was outside, make a radio call and say, ‘hey, this is where I am, I picked up these people, and they’re OK,’" says Grant.</p><p>Grant's team of volunteer pilots did 25 rescues the first day and 30 the second day after Helene. "But we did well over 100 missions, just dropping off food and supplies," he says. </p><p>Volunteer pilots were working from sunup to sundown. Grant says pilots would debrief at the end of the day for about an hour before they called it a night. </p><p>One story stood out to Grant the most: "He [a pilot doing a rescue] went to go pick up some people, and he could see arms sticking out from the mudslides that had gone over."</p><p>Also doing missions, but just dropping off supplies — was South Carolinian, Austin Lane. He heard about a group on Facebook, Carolina Aviators Network, putting together a group of pilot volunteers to get donations closer to the mountains. </p><p>Lane flies a 1960s Baron twin-engine plane with a 1,000-pound load capacity, allowing him to fly a little further than other planes volunteering. </p><p>"Delivered diapers for people with newborn babies or delivered canned goods or dietary restrictions and insulin," Lane says. </p><p>Looking back, Lane is amazed at the organization of the donation sites he landed on. He says it only took minutes for volunteers at local airports to load his plane with supplies. </p><p>"It was one of the very few that could get further out. So we were doing 6 to 8 trips a day," he says. </p><p>Grant reflects on the overall experience, "The people that donated their supplies, their people, their helicopters, whatever it was…that was the best part."</p><p>Roads began to clear with help from the North Carolina National Guard and other volunteers. This allowed more volunteers and nonprofit organizations to get further into the hardest hit regions. </p><p>The NCNG tells FOX there were 869 air rescues, with 165 of them being complex hoist rescues. In an email to FOX, "A complex hoist rescue is when a helicopter crew uses a hoist to lift people from dangerous or hard-to-reach places during a disaster or emergency, and the situation is harder than a normal rescue."</p><p>Overall, the NCNG says South Carolina, Maryland, Oklahoma, Georgia, Florida, Connecticut, Minnesota, Iowa, New York, and Pennsylvania provided aircraft. The Army Helicopters used 21 CH-47 Chinooks, 7 UH-60 Blackhawks, 4 UH-72 Lakotas for a total of 32 helicopters.</p><p>The NCNG also rescued 226 pets, dropped off 3,638 food pallets and brought in 1,877 tons of cargo by air.  </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Trump administration announced late Friday it is revoking the U.S. visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro over alleged "reckless and incendiary actions" in New York City. </p><p>"Earlier today, Colombian president @petrogustavo stood on a NYC street and urged U.S. soldiers to disobey orders and incite violence," read a post on the U.S. State Department's X account. "We will revoke Petro’s visa due to his reckless and incendiary actions."</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to the Colombian embassy but did not hear back before publication. </p><p>The visa revocation comes on the heels of the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly in New York City this week. </p><p>Videos circulating online show the Colombian president addressing a crowd gathered at a demonstration against Israel and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was in New York City Friday to address the assembly. </p><p>In a fiery speech earlier this week, Petro called for a criminal investigation against President Donald Trump and other administration officials over deadly strikes on boats in the Caribbean that the White House said were carrying drugs. </p><p>Petro repudiated the attacks, calling them an "act of tyranny," while also accusing Trump of criminalizing poverty and migration.</p><p>"Criminal proceedings must be opened against those officials, who are from the U.S., even if it includes the highest-ranking official who gave the order: President Trump," Petro said of the strikes, adding that boat passengers were not members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang as the Trump administration claimed after the first attack.</p><p>If the boats were carrying drugs as alleged by the U.S. government, Petro said, their passengers "were not drug traffickers; they were simply poor young people from Latin America who had no other option."</p><p>Petro, a former Marxist guerrilla and Colombia’s first leftist leader, has had a rocky relationship with Trump since the inauguration.</p><p>In January, Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs on all imports from the Latin American country if it did not accept military planes full of deported Colombians as part of Trump’s deportation sweep. Petro threatened to retaliate with counter tariffs but later relented and agreed to lift his ban on the flights. </p><p>In April, Petro claimed that the Trump administration had revoked his travel visa to the U.S. During a cabinet meeting that month, Petro said he could not attend meetings with international organizations in Washington, D.C., because "they took away my visa." </p><p>"I didn’t need to have one, but anyway, I’ve already seen Donald Duck several times, so I’ll go see other things," Petro said. </p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Caitlin McFall, Anders Hagstrom and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">DEA in Atlanta using new lab to process federal drug seizures as fight against cartel heats up</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in Atlanta has a new tool in its fight against one of Mexico's most notorious cartels.</p><p>The DEA Atlanta Field Division opened a new lab in May to process all federal drug seizures in Georgia. The lead DEA agent in Atlanta said the lab is already making agents more efficient as they go after the violent "Cartel Jalisco New Generation (CJNG)."</p><p>In the past, the DEA in Atlanta would call in chemists from labs in other cities to test drugs, a process that took a few days to complete. Now that the lab is in house, the agency can test drugs within minutes. </p><p>"It would take maybe a day or two for somebody to come out," said Chad Chumbley, DEA Supervisory Forensic Chemist. "We are able to respond right away and help out."</p><p>Since federal prosecutors determine charges based on what the drug is and how much of it an agent seizes, the DEA chemists who test and weigh the drugs play a vital role in the process.</p><p>In September, the DEA in Atlanta seized over 1,000 pounds of meth in an operation targeting the CJNG. After the busts, agents sent the drugs to the lab for testing. </p><p>"We will take a statistical sampling to give a general proportion of the population that will contain the substance," Chumbley said. </p><p>Agents arrested five illegal immigrants who they said were distributing the meth in black trash bags. Robert Murphy, Special Agent in Charge of the DEA Atlanta Field Division, said all the suspects were Mexican nationals with ties to CJNG.</p><p>"Over 700 pounds of this was in an apartment with two kids under ten years old in there," Murphy said. "They do that by design. Cartels want to blend in."</p><p>Murphy estimated the street value of the meth to be at least $4 million. He said the suspects were also in charge of getting that money back to the cartel. </p><p>"Their drug of choice is money. They care nothing about the poison, the people, the lives they're destroying or the misery they're dealing in. That doesn't bother them one bit," Murphy said.</p><p>CJNG has risen to power ever since the arrest of multiple high-ranking members of the rival Sinaloa Cartel.</p><p>In 2023, El Chapo's son, Ovidio Guzmán López, was arrested in Mexico. The next year, Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán Lopez, another son of El Chapo, were arrested in El Paso, Texas.</p><p>"All the war and fighting going on in Mexico — it's about one thing. Whoever controls the gateway, the access points to the U.S., wins the war in the end," Murphy said. "CJNG has risen to power, and we want to make sure our efforts are focused on making sure they don't get too strong."</p><p>The operation is part of the DEA's nationwide effort to crackdown on CJNG. </p><p>On Monday, DEA agents stopped more than 175 pounds of cocaine linked to the cartel from crossing the southern border into the United States. The next day, agents in Houston seized more than 28 pounds of cocaine and $470,000 from suspected CJNG members. </p><p>"Every little bit counts. Every seizure counts. We're targeting the entire network from facilitators, producers, transporters, money launderers — anybody that we come across that's related to CJNG, we are pursuing," said Brian Leordo, DEA Houston Field Division Deputy Special Agent in Charge.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Nearly one year ago, Hurricane Helene downgraded to a tropical storm and surged right through Western North Carolina, destroying over 74,000 homes and causing around $60 billion in damages, according to the governor's office.</p><p>Some families are still trying to figure out how to move forward a year after the storm. </p><p>"My entire 20th year of life has been recovering from a storm," Amiyah Keele said while reflecting on the past 12 months with her mother, Jessica.</p><p>The Keeles currently live in a camper on a property in Burnsville, North Carolina, after Helene sent about four feet of water through their home on Sept. 27, 2024. Their camper is right next to a house with other family members.</p><p>The Keeles first spoke with FOX back in November, while they were stocking up on fuel for their generators. </p><p>"The water was too high and too fast, like we - just made it out," Amiyah said. The Keele family waded through the raging river until they were safe with their neighbors, staying for nearly a week.</p><p>In the aftermath of the storm, the majority of the region had no cell service, electricity or running water.</p><p>"About a week of just — just nothing, like we didn’t know if anybody else we knew were(sic) okay," Amiyah said. </p><p>After about a week, volunteers and donations began pouring into the region from all over the country.</p><p>One group set up a distribution and supply site just a couple miles down the road from the Keeles. The only way they could get there was by walking, but the family went nearly every day to help volunteer. </p><p>"[About] five days later and luckily, we were blessed with wonderful tents," Jessica told FOX. For nearly a month, the family stayed in tents as recovery began around them.</p><p>Volunteers and nonprofit organizations also donated a new car and generators to the Keeles. </p><p>Amiyah said a heater is a "godsend" when "you're trying to sleep in a tent." Not too long after, the family was blessed with a camper by a nonprofit.</p><p>"It didn’t have power or water, but it was better than a tent," Jessica said. </p><p>The Keeles are still living in the donated camper. Since then, they've received a couple of donated sheds, which hold some of their belongings. Damaged appliances and furniture still sit outside their flooded home.</p><p>"Samaritan's Purse is great. They came and mucked out the house and had a snowball fight with my son," Jessica said.</p><p>Meanwhile, a simple reminder to keep on going through the trauma and obstacles is a wooden sign hanging in the donated camper that said "so this is not Home Sweet Home…ADJUST!"</p><p>Jessica said the sign survived the flood.</p><p>She told FOX, "We’re actually doing great compared to some people," and Amiyah chimed in, "And we’re still struggling."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Investigators have identified a suspect in a Texas quadruple murder cold case more than three decades old. </p><p>Police in Austin said on Friday that they had linked Robert Eugene Brashers to the murders of four teen girls at a yogurt shop in 1991 through DNA. </p><p>Brashers, who committed suicide in 1999, was also suspected of being a serial predator at the time, according to the Austin American-Statesman. </p><p>He was convicted of attempted murder after shooting a woman in the head in 1985, and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. He was released in 1989 after only serving three years in prison, the Statesman reported. </p><p>He fatally shot himself following a police standoff at a motel where he had been hiding with his wife, daughter and two stepdaughters, after releasing them from the motel.</p><p>DNA evidence also linked Brashers after his death to three rapes and murders in Missouri and South Carolina – including a mother and daughter – and a rape in Tennessee. </p><p>Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott, who were teenagers at the time of the murders, were charged and convicted of the killings in 2001 and 2002. </p><p>They were sentenced to death and life in prison respectively, but their convictions were overturned on appeal, one of the reasons being that there was no DNA evidence linking them to the crimes. </p><p>Later becoming known as the "Yogurt Shop Murders," the violent case remains infamous in Austin and is still open. HBO premiered a docuseries called "The Yogurt Shop Murders" last month about the killings. </p><p>Amy Ayers, 13; Eliza Thomas, 17; and sisters Jennifer and Sarah Harbison, ages 17 and 15, were bound, gagged and shot in the head at the "I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt" store where two of them worked. The building was then set on fire.</p><p>"Our team never gave up working this case," Austin police said in a statement on Friday. </p><p>The department has a conference planned on Monday to discuss the new evidence in the case. </p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump administration presses Supreme Court on executive order restricting birthright citizenship</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Trump administration in June filed a petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review President Trump’s executive order restricting birthright citizenship, a move that could redefine a long-standing constitutional guarantee. That appeal has not yet been docketed, but justices are expected in coming weeks to decide whether to hear the case, according to Fox News.</p><p>According to CNN, the filing by Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the prevailing interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment is "mistaken" and has had "destructive consequences." Sauer wrote that lower-court rulings against the order improperly conferred "the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people."</p><p>At stake is whether the U.S. will continue to recognize nearly all children born on its soil as citizens, a principle the Supreme Court decided in "United States v. Wong Kim Ark" (1898).</p><p>The outcome could reshape the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause, which has long been understood to guarantee citizenship to virtually every child born on U.S. soil regardless of parents’ status.</p><p>John Eastman, who advised on drafting the order, praised the administration’s appeal. "Hurrah for Solicitor General Sauer for expeditiously seeking Supreme Court review of the Ninth Circuit’s decision blocking President Trump’s executive order restoring the original meaning of the 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause," Eastman told Fox News Digital.</p><p>"The people who drafted and ratified that clause never intended to confer automatic citizenship on the children of temporary visitors, and certainly not to the children of illegal aliens. The historical record is clear, and I look forward to the Supreme Court restoring the original meaning of the clause."</p><p>Trump’s order seeks to narrow that interpretation to children of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. If upheld, it could deny automatic citizenship to many children born in the U.S. each year.</p><p>In "Wong Kim Ark," the Court ruled that a San Francisco-born man whose Chinese parents were barred from naturalization was nonetheless an American citizen under the 14th Amendment. That decision cemented "jus soli," or citizenship by birth on American soil, with narrow exceptions for children of diplomats, foreign occupiers and sovereign tribal nations.</p><p>Critics of the executive order argue that the text and history are clear. UC Berkeley law professor John Yoo has written that the Framers borrowed British "jus soli" traditions and that Reconstruction lawmakers expanded citizenship to ensure formerly enslaved people and their descendants were fully included."It is simply beyond doubt that the Framers operated by borrowing and adopting common law principles … to adopt an interpretation that rejects that meaning, we would want to see historical evidence that the Framers had adopted a radically new interpretation," Yoo wrote.</p><p>Supporters of the order counter that the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" requires full and lawful political allegiance, not simply being born on U.S. soil. John Eastman, who advised on drafting the policy, has argued that the Constitution requires both birth on U.S. soil and "complete" jurisdiction. "Complete" means allegiance to the U.S., not to another sovereign. </p><p>The order has already faced multiple challenges. Federal courts initially blocked it with broad injunctions, though the Supreme Court later narrowed those rulings.</p><p>In a recent dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested class actions could provide a way forward for challengers, writing that "parents of children covered by the Citizenship Order would be well advised to file promptly class action suits … and lower courts would be wise to act swiftly." </p><p>"Every court to have looked at this cruel order agrees that it is unconstitutional … we are fighting to make sure President Trump cannot trample on the citizenship rights of a single child," said Cody Wofsy, an attorney with the ACLU after June's petition.</p><p>"This executive order directly opposes our Constitution, values, and history, and it would create a permanent, multigenerational subclass," added Devon Chaffee, executive director of ACLU-NH.</p><p>Karla McKanders of the Legal Defense Fund called the order "an unlawful attempt to entrench racial hierarchies," saying, "Citizenship is a right afforded to us by birth, not by privilege."</p><p>Fox News Digital has requested comment from the White House and the ACLU and its partner organizations.</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Georgia businessman's billboard tribute to Charlie Kirk is drawing national attention in the wake of the Turning Point USA founder's recent murder.</p><p>Wayne Robinson, president of Wayne Robinson Holdings, owns a Steak 'n Shake location in Rome, Georgia. The 1950s-inspired chain serves milkshakes and burgers, and the Rome location is one of hundreds across the country.</p><p>Robinson told Fox News Digital he was devastated after Kirk was fatally shot in the neck while speaking to audience members at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10.</p><p>"I've always been a follower of Charlie," said Robinson, noting he was impressed by Kirk's debates with students on college campuses.</p><p>"He was bringing so many of those young people to Christ. … He touched me, and when the assassination happened, it was something that really wore heavy on me."</p><p>The day after Kirk died, Robinson was compelled to act quickly. He alerted one of his marketing partners to "put something out there to honor Charlie."</p><p>The billboard reads, "Charlie Kirk, 1993-2025," followed by the words, "Stand up, speak out, stay bold."</p><p>Within days, the response went viral with millions of likes on X – and Robinson said the local response "has been phenomenal."</p><p>"I think it's got 58,000 local comments. … People from outlying areas [are] saying they're going to drive to my store just to eat lunch, eat dinner, just to pay respect for what I've done for Charlie," he said.</p><p>Robinson's location wasn't the only Steak 'n Shake spot that received an outpouring of customers after the billboard went viral.</p><p>After Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who represents Rome, shared an image of the billboard on social media, people across the country said they'd patronize the chain.</p><p>"Eating at Steak ‘n Shake because they put up a Charlie Kirk billboard," one person wrote on X. "This is the second time this week, all because I saw they put up a billboard in Charlie’s honor."</p><p>"They should be rewarded for this with our business," another said.</p><p>Robinson said his store received calls across the country, from Michigan to Wisconsin to California, just to say thank you.</p><p>"They took the time to physically find us, find our phone number at the store and call to say thank you for doing that," he said.</p><p>Robinson said Steak ‘n Shake’s corporate office contacted him shortly after the billboard went viral.</p><p>"They said, 'You know, you're supposed to get everything OK'd through corporate when you use the name Steak 'n Shake on it, but we really like it,'" Robinson recalled.</p><p>"It reached [the Steak 'n Shake owner] and he liked it so much he asked if they could have permission … to do this across the nation."</p><p>Steak 'n Shake did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p><p>Although Robinson is still saddened by Kirk's death, he said he believes the 31-year-old's legacy is "reaching a lot of people and changing a lot of minds."</p><p>"He has started a revival across the country that has been so needed," Robinson said.</p><p>"I don't think he would have ever thought, in his wildest dreams, the response that would have taken place after he was assassinated," he added. "But the movement is great … and I just appreciate all that he did."</p><p>Robinson's billboard is one of many tributes to Kirk that have emerged in the past two weeks.</p><p>Grooveberries Frozen Yogurt in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, received backlash after honoring Kirk through stickers on its frozen yogurt cups.</p><p>Last week, a group of Kirk supporters petitioned Starbucks to honor him by adding his signature tea order to menus nationwide.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Vice President JD Vance calls out 'left-wing radicals' for inciting political violence in social media post</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Vice President JD Vance fired back on social media on Friday after being tagged in a video that appeared to mock Trump supporters over their response to the 2023 Bud Light controversy.</p><p>The clip, which was posted to X, showed a man shooting Bud Light cans seemingly in protest of the brand's 2023 partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. </p><p>The user then took aim at Vance, telling him not to complain about "violent rhetoric from the left."</p><p>"This is how MAGA responded after Bud Lite had the audacity to feature a trans influencer in their ads," the X user said. "So spare us your b------- about violent rhetoric from the left, [JD Vance]."</p><p>Vance replied to the post, writing, "I call upon all of our supporters to stop the violence against innocent beer cans. And I call upon all left-wing radicals to stop inciting violence against innocent people."</p><p>Earlier in the week, Vance said those who denigrate law enforcement are encouraging "crazy people to go and commit violence" after a shooter opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility Wednesday in Dallas. </p><p>"You don't have to agree with my immigration policies. You don't have to agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies. But if your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell," Vance said Wednesday during a trip to North Carolina. "And you have no place in the political conversation of the United States of America.</p><p>"If you want to stop political violence, stop attacking our law enforcement as the Gestapo. If you want to stop political violence, stop telling your supporters that everybody who disagrees with you is a Nazi. If you want to stop political violence, look in the mirror. That's the way that we stop political violence in this country." </p><p>Vance has also blamed the death of Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated at Utah Valley University earlier this month, on "left-wing political radicalization."</p><p>"They tried to silence our dear friend Charlie Kirk," JD Vance said at Kirk's memorial. "And, tonight, we speak with Charlie and for Charlie, louder than ever."</p><p>The Bud Light controversy in 2023 sparked massive backlash against both transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney and the beer brand. Mulvaney came under fire after posting a video in April 2023 revealing the beer company sent packs of Bud Light with the influencer’s face as part of a new ad campaign and to celebrate Mulvaney’s full year of transitioning to "girlhood."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa issues sharp response to Cam Newton's scathing assessment</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Miami Dolphins had a disappointing end to the 2024 season. After falling short of the playoffs, the Dolphins' woes have continued into the early portion of the 2025 campaign.</p><p>Miami's 0-3 start this season has further placed quarterback Tua Tagovailoa's performance under the microscope. Former NFL QB-turned media personality Cam Newton is among those who have criticized Tagovailoa.</p><p>During one of last week's episodes of ESPN's "First Take," Newton cited Tagovailoa's four-year, $212.1 million contract extension during his critique of the Pro Bowl signal-caller's performance.</p><p>"Tagovailoa is making more than Patrick Mahomes, Justin Herbert, Lamar Jackson, Jalen Hurts, Baker Mayfield, Matthew Stafford, Jayden Daniels. Am I pocket watching? No, I'm putting things into perspective here," Newton, the 2015 NFL MVP, said last week.</p><p>"In this case, it should be more money, more expectations. When I see Tua Tagovailoa over this year alone, I've heard him more than I ever had. That's not to say you can't talk. I like quiet Tua. Alabama Tua. Chip on your shoulder Tua. Not 'Is somebody going to come in and watch film.'</p><p>"What you're being paid, what you're asked to do, what you have the capability of, from one quarterback to another, I look at the situation like ‘Come on, dawg.’ Especially when you've got a Ferrari and a Lamborghini and other amenities that other quarterbacks wish they had."</p><p>Newton's comments were later brought to the attention of Tagovailoa's, who suggested he contends with much more challenging circumstances than pundits may give credence to.</p><p>"Well, anybody can play quarterback in this league then. I want to see anybody on the streets come and play quarterback," Tagovailoa said. "Cam is doing his thing for sure, but I think it's easier to be able to hold a clicker and talk about it that way or talk about what someone else is doing wrong when you're not going out and having to do the same as them.</p><p>"I think it's easy to do that. I think anybody can do that. I don't think anybody can play quarterback."</p><p>Tagovailoa also acknowledged his performance level has fallen well short of the standard he holds himself to.</p><p>Through three games this season, Tagovailoa has thrown five touchdowns and four interceptions. His quarterback rating ranks among the bottom of the NFL.</p><p>While Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel is aware there is always room for improvement, he applauded Tagovailoa for his mental toughness during the team's on-field struggles.</p><p>"The game of a franchise quarterback is never just still. … There's opportunities that he needs to take advantage of," McDaniel said. "There's also a ton of opportunities to turn the ball over that he hasn't taken. He's really answered the bell for 99% of the time. ... It's not an easy task to be in his shoes, but I'm very happy with where his mind is at and where his focus is at because if he was a weaker-minded individual, it's tough for any quarterback during any losing streak or any whatever.</p><p>"He's focused on being 1-0 against the New York Jets, and that's why I know he's capable. And I'm excited to see his next opportunity that we work on all week because of just that, of being focused on the right things."</p><p>Tagovailoa has had some notable achievements since being drafted 10th overall in 2020. He was the NFL's passing leader in 2023.</p><p>The Dolphins host the winless New York Jets on Sunday.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A federal grand jury has indicted three women for allegedly following a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent from his workplace, livestreaming the pursuit on social media and then posting his home address online.</p><p>The indictment charges the trio — Cynthia Raygoza, 37, of Riverside, California; Ashleigh Brown, 38, of Aurora, Colorado; and Sandra Carmona Samane, 25, of Panorama City, California — with one count of conspiracy and one count of publicly disclosing the personal information of a federal agent, according to an announcement Friday from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.</p><p>"Our brave federal agents put their lives on the line every day to keep our nation safe," Acting U.S. Attorney in California Bill Essayli said in a statement. "The conduct of these defendants is deeply offensive to law enforcement officers and their families. If you threaten, dox or harm in any manner one of our agents or employees, you will face prosecution and prison time."</p><p>On August 28, the women allegedly followed the ICE agent from the Civic Center in downtown Los Angeles to his house, livestreaming the chase live on Instagram accounts identified as "ice_out_of_la," "defendmesoamericanculture," and "corn_maiden_design," according to the indictment.</p><p>Prosecutors allege the defendants gave directions as they followed the agent and urged viewers to share the feed. Once outside his home, they shouted to neighbors that their "neighbor is ICE," "la migra lives here" and "ICE lives on your street, and you should know," as noted in the indictment.</p><p>The three women then allegedly posted the agent’s address online with the message, "Come on down."</p><p>Brown and Samane were arrested. Brown, who also faces separate charges of assaulting a federal officer, remains in custody without bond, while Samane was released on $5,000 bond. Their arraignments are slated for Sept. 30 and Oct. 9, respectively.</p><p>Raygoza remains at large, according to the indictment.</p><p>If convicted, each woman faces up to five years in federal prison per count.</p><p>The announcement comes as one ICE detainee was killed and two others were injured Wednesday when a gunman opened fire on an agency facility in Dallas. In July, the Department of Homeland Security said attacks on ICE agents had skyrocketed by 830% since January.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Trump administration official was physically assaulted by a "deranged leftist" inside the United Nations Thursday afternoon during the gathering of the UN General Assembly, Fox News Digital has learned.</p><p>An official working in international relations for the Department of Health and Human Services was in New York City serving in a support role for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the department’s leadership team at UNGA.</p><p>"An HHS official was followed into a bathroom, recorded, physically assaulted and verbally accosted by a deranged leftist at the UN who somehow entered the venue past multiple layers of security," White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly told Fox News Digital. "Thankfully, the official is safe, and the lunatic was arrested, but this is part of a disturbing and dangerous set of failures by the UN after their sabotage of President Trump ahead of and during his speech."</p><p>Kelly told Fox News Digital that the U.S. Secret Service will investigate "how this violent protester was admitted into a major national security event."</p><p>A source familiar told Fox News Digital that the individual has been charged with assault, aggravated harassment, attempted assault and criminal possession of a weapon. The individual was released from custody at 7:30 p.m. Friday night, the source said. The individual is expected in court next on Nov. 13. </p><p>"The UN must answer why these highly concerning incidents continue to happen against the president and his staff," Kelly said.</p><p>"We are outraged that a member of the U.S. delegation was physically assaulted inside of UN Headquarters the afternoon of September 25," a U.S. UN spokesperson told Fox News Digital. "This attack must be addressed swiftly, and consequences must be felt."</p><p>The spokesperson told Fox News Digital that "the UN itself recognizes that it has lost its way."</p><p>"Now, it has devolved into an arena where an American delegation member is harassed and assaulted," the spokesperson said. "If you can’t keep people safe in your own building, how can you claim to be the world’s diplomatic center?"</p><p>The spokesperson called the incident "unacceptable," and told Fox News Digital that the United Nations "will use every available resource to support the U.S. Secret Service into their investigation of this incident."</p><p>"We know the UN needs dramatic reform and now must also immediately implement a thorough review of the UN’s security operations," the spokesperson said. "The UN’s failures are evident worldwide, and now in its own halls."</p><p>The U.S. UN spokesperson added: "Enough is enough."</p><p>The official recounted her experience of being followed, harassed, and physically assaulted inside the United Nations in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital.</p><p>The official told Fox News Digital that she was walking down the hallway at the UN when a woman began berating her and shining a bright light in her face.</p><p>"It was very disorienting," the official said. "Once I took a step back and regained my footing, it didn’t stop. I realized what was happening. I realized I was being yelled at and that the light was also a recording device."</p><p>The official tried to get away from the woman who was screaming derogatory and pro-Palestinian comments at her as she followed closely behind.</p><p>The official said the woman called her a "fascist" and a "Nazi." </p><p>"The insults changed to specific insults," the official said, telling Fox News Digital that she went into the women’s bathroom to get away, but that the woman kept following her.</p><p>"Her yelling turned into screaming—hyper-aggressive insults," the official said. </p><p>The official tried to hide in a bathroom stall, but told Fox News Digital that the woman was pushing and trying to get into the stall. Once the official was able to close the door, the woman put the camera over the door of the bathroom stall to continue filming the official and screaming. </p><p>The official waited for the screaming to stop, and exited the stall, hoping the woman had left, but the woman was waiting for her at the door, and continued to follow her into the hallway, continuing to yell at her and shine the light in her face. Eventually, the official was able to get away.</p><p>The official told Fox News Digital the incident lasted approximately 10 minutes.</p><p>"It felt very political in nature," she said. "Secretary Kennedy gets a tremendous number of bows and arrows and threats that he deals with, but it seems that it’s not enough, and it is trickling down."</p><p>She added: "That’s a scary thing for the team. But we’re more empowered, and we have amazing leadership."</p><p>Fox News Digital has learned that the woman was arrested by the New York City Police Department. It is unclear whether she is still in custody.</p><p>The NYPD did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. </p><p>The United Nations did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Major pro-life group demands investigation into abortion pill billboards in Florida</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>: A major pro-life organization is calling on Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier to investigate a nonprofit it accuses of running "deceptive and misleading" abortion pill ads across the state.</p><p>In a Sept. 19 letter obtained by Fox News Digital, 40 Days for Life urged Uthmeier to take action against Mayday Health, a New York-based nonprofit that has placed billboards around Florida promoting the abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol.</p><p>"Those pictures are not [artificial intelligence]," Shawn Carney, president and CEO of 40 Days For Life, told Fox News Digital on Friday. "Those are actual pictures of boats floating in front of tourists — trying to get a tan, trying to enjoy their time off of work — and yet they're having abortion pills shoved in their face. It's out of touch, and it could be illegal."</p><p>The pro-life group argues the ads fail to disclose critical information, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) black box warnings about risks like hemorrhage and infection, while also omitting federally required safety protocols and potential legal consequences for Floridians.</p><p>"It shows once again how out of touch abortion advocates are in a post-Roe America where they have no sense of mission," Carney said. "They cannot read the room at all, and now they can’t read the law."</p><p>Carney and other members of 40 Days for Life have called on Florida’s top prosecutor to launch an investigation and possibly pursue prosecution. </p><p>"I think that they need to be investigated and possibly prosecuted because this definitely seems like a violation of Florida's deceptive advertising law," Carney told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Florida bans most abortions after six weeks, making it one of the strictest states in the nation. Carney said the grassroots structure of 40 Days for Life — which has more than 1 million participants across 1,800 cities globally — allows the group to spot local problems first.</p><p>"When things like this happen at the local level, we're the first to see it," Carney said. "So, when we see these new ad campaigns for abortion pills or whether we see doctors doing illegal abortions, we're going to look into it and report it and take legal action."</p><p>Carney also argued that the overturning of Roe v. Wade has forced abortion advocates to defend positions he described as extreme. </p><p>"Gen Z has turned against abortion because they're the first generation in our country to ever have a photo of their own ultrasound," he said. "And that's why they are the most pro-life generation ever at their age."</p><p>Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier and Mayday Health did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face, and that's exactly what happened to Team USA Friday morning at Bethpage Black.</p><p>For the first time in Ryder Cup history, Team Europe won each of the first three matches on American soil to take an early 3-0 lead (Europe needs 14 points to retain the Cup).</p><p>The final five matches of the day were knotted at 2.5-2.5, but Europe is right where they want to be.</p><p></p><p>After the first three matches of the day didn't even reach the 16th hole, Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele were able to birdie 18 to salvage the morning and grab a point.</p><p>The afternoon session looked like it was going USA's way, but Tommy Fleetwood is cementing himself as a Ryder Cup legend. Down a hole, Fleetwood birdied 14 and then gave himself and Justin Rose a 1-up lead with another birdie on 16. Rose's birdie on 18 clinched Europe's fifth point, shortly after yet another dominant victory over Jon Rahm.</p><p>Hometown kid Cameron Young and Justin Thomas, who lost alongside Bryson DeChambeau in the morning, took a dominant 6 &amp; 5 win over Ludvig Aberg and Rasmus Hojgaard. Cantlay and Sam Burns came back from down two to halve the final match of the day.</p><p>Rahm and Fleetwood combined to go 4-0-0 on Friday. Yes, that's the same Fleetwood who never even won a PGA Tour event until a month ago yet is now 9-3-2 in his Ryder Cup career. But Team Europe captain Luke Donald praised the Brit for being a "world-class" golfer.</p><p>"It took him a little time and had to go through a few opportunities that let slip for sure, but I think that, you know, for Tommy, he reframes it in such a positive way. I think that if you see it in a positive way, the ones that get away, it only makes you stronger" Donald said after Friday's play.</p><p>"I think Tommy, he's a guy that just loves being around the team. He loves contributing to that team. Yeah, he's a nice player to play with. I think he's at the top of the list of a lot of guys on the team that people want to play with."</p><p>Simultaneously, Scottie Scheffler and DeChambeau combined to go 0-4-0, with Scheffler, the world No. 1, never even making it to the 17th hole.</p><p>USA now needs to mount a comeback if it wants to avoid being the first team to lose on home soil since it did so in 2012. No one has won back to back Ryder Cups since Europe won three straight from 2010 to 2014.</p><p>Day 2 will tee off at 7:10 a.m. ET to begin another 11-plus hours of golf.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Rock star Bruce Springsteen warned that the Democratic Party has alienated Americans with its far-left policies, even as he remains a staunch critic of President Trump.</p><p>Springsteen, who remains an all-American icon known for anthems like "Born to Run," "Thunder Road" and "Born in the U.S.A.," has not been shy about sharing his political views over the past few decades. The rocker campaigned for then-Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, then-candidate Joe Biden in 2020, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016 and President Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008.</p><p>In an interview with Time Magazine, Springsteen revealed that he is one of many left-leaning figures who believe the Democratic Party has lost touch with everyday Americans.</p><p>"We’re desperately in need of an effective alternative party or for the Democratic Party to find someone who can speak to the majority of the nation. There is a problem with the language that they’re using and the way they’re trying to reach people," he said.</p><p>Time magazine noted the irony in that left-leaning Springsteen appeals to working-class fans while being wealthy, particularly as many of his core audience have "flocked to Trump."</p><p>"A lot of people bought into his lies," the rocker lamented to Time Magazine. "He doesn’t care about the forgotten anybody but himself and the multibillionaires who stood behind him on Inauguration Day.</p><p>"You have to face the fact that a good number of Americans are simply comfortable with his politics of power and dominance.</p><p>"He’s the living personification of what the 25th Amendment and impeachment were for. If Congress had any guts, he’d be consigned to the trash heap of history," he concluded.</p><p>In 2020, Springsteen’s 2002 hit "The Rising" became something of an anthem for the Biden campaign during the Democratic National Convention that year, to the point an Esquire article warned about the risk of its potential parallels with Clinton’s campaign using a "Glee" version of Rachel Platten's "Fight Song."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment on Springsteen’s remarks and has not received an immediate response.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A member of the Georgetown College Republicans board demanded a "full investigation" of a leftist gun club after its recruitment flyers referenced Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's assassination. </p><p>I think that everybody in the Georgetown community shares how much horror and dissentiment that we have over the fact that these flyers were there in the first place," Knox Graham told "America Reports" on Thursday.</p><p>Fox News Digital obtained photos Wednesday of red flyers posted on campus that read "Hey fascist! Catch!" from the John Brown Gun Club, a group tied to leftist activism and past violence, before they were removed. The club is not affiliated with Georgetown, according to the university's CampusGroups club database.</p><p>The same phrase was reportedly written on a shell casing belonging to Tyler Robinson, Kirk's suspected assassin, who was charged with one count of aggravated murder. On Sept. 10, Robinson allegedly shot Kirk in the neck while the conservative activist spoke at Utah Valley University.</p><p>A second wave of posters taped up Thursday night in the school’s main free speech zone mocked Kirk’s assassination. One showed Kirk’s face with his eyes blacked out alongside the words "Follow your leader" and "Rest in p---, Charlie."</p><p>Georgetown University removed both posters and reported both incidents to the FBI, according to its statement Thursday. </p><p>The first wave of advertisements touted being the "only political group that celebrates when Nazis die." </p><p>Its QR code linked to a page that said, "We're building a community that's done with ceremonial resistance and strongly worded letters. If you want to make a real change in your community, let us know below."</p><p>Graham recounted seeing "a handful" of flyers on campus.</p><p>I first heard about these flyers when I was sitting in a classroom, and, immediately after my class ended, I rushed out to go ahead and see if they were there for myself," Graham said. "I think by the time that I got there, the university had taken most of them down."</p><p>The College Republicans member described the "darker" message he thinks the flyers send.</p><p>Well, the effort that the poster implies, I think, is to bring out some of the darker sentiments that we've seen on the internet in the aftermath of Mr. Kirk's assassination — to bring those out into the real world," Graham said. </p><p>However, he added he doesn’t believe there are "absolutely any" at Georgetown who share the flyer’s sentiments, calling them "entirely antithetical" to the Catholic and Jesuit university’s mission.</p><p>I think that that is something that all people share, the kind of disdain at the idea that somebody would be shot for exercising their free speech," Graham said. </p><p>The university similarly condemned the flyers in a statement.</p><p>"We do not tolerate calls for violence or threats to the university community," the statement read Thursday. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Massive cheating scandal involving Democratic governor candidate also involved husband: report</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A massive cheating scandal that rocked the U.S. Naval Academy in 1994 and involved New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial candidate Rep. Mikie Sherrill also involved her husband, Jason Hedberg, according to reporting by the New York Post.</p><p>This follows the improper release of bombshell private military records by the National Archives and Records Administration, which revealed that Sherrill was not allowed to walk with her graduating class at the Naval Academy and that her name was not included in the commencement program due to her involvement in the scandal.</p><p>Sherrill, a congresswoman representing New Jersey, has not been accused of cheating at the Naval Academy but rather of failing to report those who had cheated on an exam.</p><p>The Post reported that Hedberg was also caught up in the scandal. The outlet said Hedberg was one of nearly 50 midshipmen who sued the Naval Academy, the Navy and the Pentagon to block an honor board at the school from deciding whether they should be dismissed.</p><p>The suit alleged that each named plaintiff was denied due process by the academy and ordered by their superiors to make incriminating statements, according to the outlet.</p><p>The complaint stated that "in compliance with the orders of their superior military officers, each named plaintiff was compelled to make inculpatory statements to Navy Inspector General investigators."</p><p>While Sherrill did not walk in her commencement ceremony, Hedberg's name is included in the 1994 commencement program, indicating he was cleared to take part in the ceremony, which took place three months after the suit was filed.</p><p>Sherrill is locked in a tight race against Republican Jack Ciattarelli to replace term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.</p><p>Sean Higgins, a spokesperson for Sherrill's campaign, responded to the development by telling Fox News Digital that "the fact Jack Ciattarelli and MAGA Republicans are going after Mikie’s family is sick and desperate.</p><p>"Jason graduated, served honorably as a Naval Officer and the illegal disclosure of Mikie’s unredacted personal military records, including her Social Security number and the unlawful dissemination of those records by the Ciattarelli campaign is a disgrace and must be investigated." </p><p>While investigating Sherrill's suspected involvement in the 1994 cheating scandal, Ciattarelli's campaign also submitted its ownFOIA request, which confirmed her name was not on the U.S. Naval Academy graduation program that year. </p><p>The revelations have rocked the already tight race in blue-leaning New Jersey.</p><p>The Ciattarelli campaign said Nicholas De Gregorio, a friend who is not directly involved in the campaign, "submitted a lawful FOIA request" aboutSherrill's military backgroundof his own accord. </p><p>A spokesperson for the National Archives and Records Administration stated that the technician who responded to De Gregorio's request about Sherrill's military record "should NOT have released the entire record," which included private information such as her Social Security number.</p><p>The National Archives apologized for the breach of privacy and has committed to holding its staff accountable for the blunder. </p><p>In response, Sherrill has accused Ciattarelli of illegally obtaining the records.</p><p>"To have a guy I'm running against, it will stop at nothing, it will stop at nothing, who will illegally obtain records. It's just beyond the pale," Sherrill charged Thursday night on the campaign trail in Plainfield, New Jersey.</p><p>"I didn’t turn in some of my classmates, so I didn’t walk but graduated and was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy, serving for nearly ten years with the highest level of distinction and honor," Sherrill told the Globe when confronted with the commencement program. She defended not releasing any disciplinary records from her time at the academy. </p><p>Sherrill has also accused the Trump administration of colluding with Ciattarelli’s campaign.</p><p>"This is an illegal and dangerous weaponization of the federal government," Sherrill said in a statement Thursday as she criticized Ciattarelli and the Trump administration for "breaking the law and exposing private records for political gain."</p><p>On Thursday, Higgins accused the Trump administration of "targeting political opponents with an absolute disregard for the law, this time in concert with the Ciattarelli campaign."</p><p>For his part, Ciattarelli is calling on Sherrill to release her records to prove why she was blocked from attending her graduation ceremony.</p><p>In a letter sent to Sherrill's lawyers, a lawyer representing the Ciattarelli campaign said that any claim that Ciattarelli for Governor (CFG) was "part of a conspiracy to smear [Sherrill] with ill-gotten documents is completely false. In fact, it is defamatory and if [Sherrill] and her campaign continue to push this false narrative and allege that CFG and/or [campaign strategist Chris] Russell acted illegally, we will pursue defamation claims."</p><p>Sherrill's campaign did not immediately provide a response to Fox News Digital's request for comment on her husband’s involvement in the scandal.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday extended an earlier order that allows the Trump administration to continue blocking nearly $5 billion in congressionally appropriated foreign funds. </p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice had reached out to the high court for an emergency appeal after a district court judge ruled the administration’s decision to hold the aid was likely illegal, adding that Congress would need to approve the withholding of funds. </p><p>"This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch’s decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds," District Judge Amir Ali said at the time. </p><p>Friday's ruling was 6 to 3, with the three liberal justices dissenting. </p><p>President Donald Trump last month sent a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, explaining he was using a pocket rescission, which allows a president to submit a request to Congress to hold approved funds near the end of the fiscal year. </p><p>Under federal law, Congress has to approve the rescission within 45 days or the money must be spent. But the budget year will end before the 45-day window closes, and, in this situation, the White House is asserting that congressional inaction allows it not to spend the money.</p><p>It was the first use of a pocket rescission in 50 years. </p><p>Friday’s ruling extends a temporary block put on the lower court ruling by Chief Justice John Roberts on Sept. 9. </p><p>The conservative justices in the majority Friday said that Trump’s authority on foreign policy weighed in the decision but cautioned that it wasn’t a final ruling on the matter. </p><p>Reductions in foreign aid have become a hallmark of the Trump administration's America First agenda. </p><p>In her dissenting opinion, Justice Elena Kagan, joined by justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, said, "The effect is to prevent the funds from reaching their intended recipients — not just now but (because of their impending expiration) for all time." </p><p>The administration called the funds, which would have been used as foreign aid, for United Nations peacekeeping efforts and to promote democracy in other countries, "contrary to U.S. foreign policy." </p><p><i>The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A common vitamin could help prevent the development of skin cancer, new research suggests.</p><p>The study, published in JAMA Dermatology, found a decreased risk of three types of skin cancer associated with the use of nicotinamide, which is a form of vitamin B3.</p><p>The research examined the health data of more than 33,000 veterans from 1999 to 2024, pulled from Veterans Affairs (VA) records.</p><p>Patients who took nicotinamide were matched with similar patients who did not, based on characteristics like age, sex, race, skin cancer history and exposure to other treatments.</p><p>The researchers also considered whether patients had health conditions like an organ transplant history or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</p><p>Among the study group, 12,287 patients were exposed to oral vitamin B3 at 500 mg twice daily for more than 30 days and were compared to 21,479 patients who did not take it.</p><p>The researchers found that patients who took vitamin B3 had fewer skin cancers overall.</p><p>The risk of developing skin cancers — including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma — was reduced by about 14% in those exposed to the supplement.</p><p>The researchers also investigated the rate of skin cancer recurrence, noting that those who started taking nicotinamide right after their first skin cancer diagnosis had a 54% reduced risk of the disease coming back.

<div class="article-title">Humberto grows to major hurricane in the Atlantic. Maps show its forecast path.</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Humberto grew into a<span class="link">Category 4 hurricane</span> on Friday evening, "rapidly strengthening" into a major hurricane, but there were no immediate watches or warnings issued for the U.S. by the National Hurricane Center. </p><p>The storm is <span class="link">one of two systems</span> swirling over the western Atlantic that could potentially bring some downstream impacts to parts of the Southeast U.S. coast, from Florida to North Carolina, the director of the Miami-based hurricane center, Michael Brennan, said.</p><p>There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect due to either storm as of Friday afternoon. </p>
<h2>Hurricane Humberto forecast and path</h2><p>As of Friday night, Humberto was located about 390 miles northeast of the northern Leeward Islands. It was moving west at about 7 mph with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph. A storm is deemed a "major" hurricane if it's a Category 3, 4 or 5 due to the potential for "significant loss of life and damage," the NHC says.</p><p>"Rapid strengthening should continue over the central Atlantic," the hurricane center said Friday night.</p>
<p>Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles from the center of Humberto, and hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles, the hurricane center said.</p>
<p>It is the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. It comes on the heels of <span class="link">Hurricane Gabrielle</span>, which is not impacting land as it heads farther out into the Atlantic.</p><h2>Another storm system brews over the Caribbean</h2><p>The hurricane center is also closely monitoring a second storm system over the northeast Caribbean in the Atlantic, near Humberto. </p><p>The system is likely to become a tropical depression on Saturday, a tropical storm by Sunday and a hurricane by late Monday, forecasters said. </p>
<p>The system is expected to bring "significant rainfall" to portions of Cuba and the Bahamas. Cuba could see up to 16 inches of rain, while the Bahamas could receive up to 8 inches, the hurricane center said. </p>
<p>The system is expected "to move across the central and northwestern Bahamas this weekend and approach the southeast U.S. coast early next week," the hurricane center said Friday. </p>
<p>There is also a possibility it <span class="link">could interact with Humberto</span> — a phenomenon known as <span class="link">the Fujiwhara effect</span>, in which two different storms converge and either join or spin around each other. But CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said such an outcome is not considered likely in this case.</p>

<div class="article-title">Midtown Manhattan mass shooting gunman had low-stage CTE, medical examiner finds</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Shane Tamura, the gunman who killed four people in July's <span class="link">deadly Midtown Manhattan shooting</span>, had low-stage CTE, officials said Friday. </p><p>New York's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner revealed the results Friday. </p><p>"Following a thorough assessment and extensive analysis by our neuropathology experts, OCME has found unambiguous diagnostic evidence of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, also known as CTE, in the brain tissue of the decedent. The findings correspond with the classification of low-stage CTE, according to current consensus criteria," OCME said in a statement. </p><p>Tamura, a 27-year-old former high school football player, shot and killed <span class="link">Aland Etienne</span>, <span class="link">Wesley LePatner</span>, <span class="link">Julia Hyman</span> and <span class="link">NYPD Det. Didraul Islam</span> on July 28. He then shot himself in the chest. </p><p>He <span class="link">left handwritten notes</span>, <span class="link">repeatedly referencing CTE</span> and writing, "Study my brain please. I'm sorry."  </p>
<p>Though Tamura never played in the NFL, investigators believe he was <span class="link">targeting the NFL offices</span> inside the office building where he killed four people.</p><p>"The League knowingly concealed the dangers to our brains to maximize profits," Tamura wrote. </p><p>The three-page note found in Tamura's pocket said that he wanted to have his brain donated to science so it could be researched, according to law enforcement sources.</p><p>Tamura's family previously said he suffered from migraines and mental illness, as well as multiple concussions. </p>
<h2>What is CTE?</h2><p>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, is a brain disease that is most common in athletes who play contact sports, such as football players, ice hockey players and boxers. It is a degenerative disease, occurring after repeated head injuries cause cells in the brain to die. It can only be diagnosed in brain tissue after death.</p><p>Tamura's final note also included the name of <span class="link">Chris Nowinski, a leading CTE expert</span>. </p><p>"He played for 12 years. I think that's one of the more important points, is that 12 years absolutely puts you at risk for developing CTE," Nowinski said. "Low-stage CTE does represent significant changes to the brain. Brain cell death in the frontal lobes, which will affect judgment and behavior. There's no question about that." </p><p>The medical examiner's office said "the physical and mental manifestations of CTE remain under study." </p><p>Nowinski said the four victims of the shooting must remain the focus, but says this incident is a wake-up call. </p><p>"We shouldn't look at this and say 'this is why he did it,'" Nowinski said. "This hopefully is a wake-up call that we need to do more to prevent brain trauma in young athletes, because there are consequences for some of these people." </p><h2>What are the symptoms of CTE?</h2><p>There can be a variety of symptoms of CTE, including behavioral changes like aggression and impulsivity, irritability and inattention. </p>
<p>"There are people who have been diagnosed with CTE who have engaged in violent acts. It is not accurate, I don't think, to say that CTE causes violence," said Dr. Kristen Dams-O'Connor, director of the Brain Injury Research Center at Mount Sinai.</p><p>While damage may begin in the frontal lobes of the brain, over time it can affect widespread regions, causing memory loss and dementia. </p><p>Symptoms of CTE do not typically appear right after someone receives a head injury, but rather develop as time goes on, according to the Mayo Clinic.</p><p>O'Connor said CTE is rare in people with limited head trauma exposure, but she stresses a major takeaway in this incident is that anyone experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety, or having suicidal or homicidal thoughts should seek care.</p><h2>CTE in the NFL</h2><p>More cases of the disease have recently been found <span class="link">in former NFL players.</span> </p><p>Aaron Hernandez, a former New England Patriots player and convicted murderer, was diagnosed with stage 3 CTE after his death. </p><p>Former NFL player and CBS Sports analyst Irv Cross was diagnosed with stage 4 CTE. His widow said that at the time of his death, <span class="link">he was seeing things.</span></p>
<p>The Boston University CTE Center said that out of 376 former NFL players it has tested, 345 had CTE. </p><p>The NFL has made changes in recent years to prevent head injuries, including new rules and equipment.</p><p>"The NFL does acknowledge CTE and will tell you the 100 things they're doing to try to prevent it," Nowinski said.</p><p>"We continue to grieve the senseless loss of lives, and our hearts remain with the victims' families and our dedicated employees," the NFL said in a statement Friday. "There is no justification for the horrific acts that took place. As the medical examiner notes, 'the science around this condition continues to evolve, and the physical and mental manifestations of CTE remain under study'."</p>

<div class="article-title">Bondi vows to send Justice Department agents to guard ICE facilities</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Attorney General Pam Bondi said late Friday she has ordered Justice Department agents to guard Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities — and directed counterterrorism task forces to look into attacks against federal authorities.</p><p>The move by Bondi came after one detainee was killed and two others were injured in a <span class="link">shooting</span> at an ICE field office in Dallas on Wednesday, the latest shooting or threat targeting an <span class="link">ICE facility</span> or immigration agent in recent months. </p><p>"At my direction, I am deploying DOJ agents to ICE facilities—and wherever ICE comes under siege—to safeguard federal agents, protect federal property, and immediately arrest all individuals engaged in any federal crime," Bondi wrote on X.</p><p>It's not clear which federal law enforcement agencies will be deployed to ICE facilities. The Justice Department oversees the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p><p>ICE has said attacks on its agents have spiked this year, as the Trump administration uses the agency to dramatically increase arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants. In recent months, ICE operations in <span class="link">Los Angeles</span>, <span class="link">Chicago</span>, <span class="link">New York</span> and elsewhere have drawn tense protests and clashes between agents and demonstrators.</p>
<p>Bondi also floated a broader crackdown on "repeated acts of violence and obstruction against federal agents." She directed the Joint Terrorism Task Forces — which are regional entities scattered throughout the country that work with the FBI and with state and local police — to look into what she described as "domestic terrorism."</p><p>"The Department of Justice will seek the most serious available charges against all participants in these criminal mobs, including conspiracy offenses, assault offenses, civil disorder offenses, and terrorism offenses," the attorney general wrote Friday.</p><p>A day earlier, President Trump signed a memo calling for investigations into "political violence and intimidation," led by the Joint Terrorism Task Forces. The White House pointed to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk earlier this month, last year's assassination attempts against Mr. Trump, and an increase in attacks on ICE officers.</p><p>The president also <span class="link">penned an executive order</span> labeling antifa a domestic terrorist organization. The move's legal implications aren't clear. Antifa, short for "anti-fascist," generally refers to a loose collection of largely left-wing activists, not a cohesive organization with a leadership structure. Also, domestic terrorism <span class="link">isn't a chargeable offense</span> under federal law, and the government doesn't have a formal list of domestic terrorist groups, unlike with foreign groups.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><span class="link">Humberto</span>, the eighth named storm to emerge this hurricane season, is currently swirling over waters just north of the Caribbean as a major hurricane. While forecasts as of Friday predict Humberto won't ever touch land, there is a possibility it could interact with another system developing nearby in the western Atlantic. </p><p>That's an unlikely outcome, said CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan. But if such a collision does occur, it could produce what's called <span class="link">the Fujiwhara effect</span>, a rare phenomenon in which two different storms merge and become entangled around a newly formed, common center. </p><p>How the process plays out depends on the characteristics of the storms involved, according to the National Weather Service. The forecasting agency describes the Fujiwhara effect on its website as "an intense dance" between two tropical storms that can happen when they get close enough to each other on their respective tracks to reach a common point and either join together or spin around each other for a period of time before continuing along their individual paths.  </p>
<p>In the latter scenario, the storms involved must be comparably strong or large.</p><p>"Typically when one system is stronger than the other, the smaller and weaker system will get overrun by the larger, stronger one and completely eliminate it," Nolan said. </p><p>Similar systems "will dance around each other" before going their separate ways, she continued, adding: "Very rarely has a larger system absorbed a smaller one and become larger or stronger, but it is scientifically possible."</p>
<p>Humberto grew into a tropical storm Wednesday night while traveling over open waters in the central tropical Atlantic, and then gained hurricane status early Friday morning. Humberto was a <span class="link">Category 4</span> storm as of late Friday evening. </p><p>Forecasters expect it to move northwest over the next few days and strengthen along the way, the National Hurricane Center said. It's one of two systems in the region that could potentially impact parts of the southeastern United States, including coastal areas from Florida to North Carolina, according to Michael Brennan, director of the hurricane center.</p>
<p>Officials at the center said Wednesday that they were monitoring a second storm churning near Humberto over the northeastern Caribbean, which would likely become a tropical depression later in the week and a tropical storm, named Imelda, over the weekend. That system is expected to strengthen as it tracks toward the Bahamas — driving up the chances of storm surge, wind and rainfall striking coastal parts of the southeastern U.S.</p><p>"With the two tropical troubles currently north of the Caribbean, these two may interact under the Fujiwhara effect in the days ahead," said Nolan. However, because the developing system "appears to be much weaker than Humberto and several miles away from it," an interaction between the two — if one even takes place at all — may not result in a tangled gravitational "dance." </p>
<p>In the event Humberto and the second system do collide, it's possible the paths they're expected to travel will change, Nolan added, but only slightly.</p>

<div class="article-title">MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed Smartmatic, federal judge rules</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>MyPillow founder <span class="link">Mike Lindell</span>, an ally of President Trump, defamed the election technology company Smartmatic with false statements that its voting machines helped rig the 2020 presidential election, a federal judge in Minnesota ruled Friday.</p><p>But U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan deferred until future proceedings the question of whether Lindell — one of the country's most prominent propagators <span class="link">of false claims</span> that the 2020 election was a fraud — acted with the "actual malice" that Smartmatic still needs to prove to collect any damages.</p><p>The judge said there are "genuine fact disputes" as to whether Lindell's statements were made "with knowledge that they were false or made with reckless disregard to their falsity." He noted that the defense says Lindell has an "unwavering belief" that his statements were truthful.</p><p>The statements cited by the judge arose from Lindell's criticism of the results of the 2020 election in California's Los Angeles County, which former President Joe Biden carried with 71% of the vote over Mr. Trump and helped Biden secure the state's 55 electoral votes.</p><p>The county used Smartmatic's computerized touchscreen ballot-marking devices and was the company's only customer for the 2020 election. Lindell alleged the machines were rigged to change Trump votes to Biden votes.</p>
<p>The judge ruled there were 51 specific times when Lindell falsely claimed — in documentaries he produced and through various media and personal appearances — that Smartmatic interfered with the results.</p><p>"The Court concludes that, based on the record presented, no reasonable trier of fact could find that any of the statements at issue are true," Bryan wrote.</p><p>Smartmatic attorney Erik Connolly said they will be seeking "nine-figure damages" from Lindell and MyPillow for "spreading lies" about the company.</p><p>"Smartmatic did not and could not have rigged the 2020 election," Connolly said in a statement. "It was impossible, and everything that Mr. Lindell said about Smartmatic was false."</p>
<p>Lindell told The Associated Press shortly after the Smartmatic ruling was filed Friday that he hadn't seen it, but that it was "the most bizarre thing I've ever heard."</p><p>Lindell went on to call Smartmatic "one of the most corrupt companies in the world," and he vowed to keep fighting until its voting machines are "melted down and turned into prison bars." He said he'll take his crusade to eliminate voting machines in favor of paper ballots all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if he has to.</p><p>Smartmatic has been on a winning streak, having reached settlements last year with two conservative news outlets, <span class="link">including Newsmax</span> and One America News Network. The Florida-based company also still has an active case against Fox News.</p><p>Lindell also has made similar claims against Dominion Voting Systems. He lost a case involving the Denver-based company in June <span class="link">when a jury ruled</span> that he defamed a former Dominion employee by accusing him of treason. The jury awarded $2.3 million in damages.</p><p>Lindell, a Republican, also told CBS News in a text message Friday that he is considering a gubernatorial run in Minnesota, confirming local news reports in the state. Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz <span class="link">announced last week</span> he is running for a third term.</p><p>"I am considering running," Lindell wrote. "...We are doing our due-diligence and so far things are looking very good!"</p><p>He added, "I will certainly be adding securing our elections to my platform! We polled Minnesota and secure our elections was the #3 concern!"</p>
<p>MyPillow is headquartered in the Minneapolis metropolitan area.</p><p>Lindell and MyPillow have faced a number of legal and financial setbacks in recent years, but he won a victory in July when a federal appeals court ruled he didn't have to pay <span class="link">a $5 million arbitration award</span> to a software engineer who disputed data that Lindell claimed proved China interfered in the 2020 election. The court said the arbitration panel overstepped its authority.</p>

<div class="article-title">Some Walmart, Trader Joe's pasta meals may be linked to deadly listeria outbreak, USDA says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is warning consumers not to eat certain ready-to-eat pasta meals sold at Walmart and Trader Joe's stores because they may be contaminated with listeria bacteria previously linked to a <span class="link">deadly outbreak</span> tied to pre-made chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals.</p><p>In an announcement Thursday, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued a public health alert for Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs &amp; Marinara Sauce sold at Walmart in refrigerated 12-ounce clear plastic trays. The products have best-by dates of Sept. 22 through Oct. 1 and may still be in consumers' refrigerators.</p><p>In an update on Friday, the FSIS added to its public health alert some meals sold at Trader Joe's, the Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo, sold in 16-ounce plastic tray packages with "best if used by" dates of Sept. 20, Sept. 24 or Sept. 27. The products contain the establishment number "P- 45288" inside the USDA mark of inspection.</p><p>The affected meals from Walmart contain the establishment numbers "EST. 50784" and "EST. 47718" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the label. They were sent to Walmart stores nationwide.</p>
<p>"The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority. We have removed this product from our impacted stores and we are working with the supplier to investigate," a Walmart spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News on Friday. </p>
<p>There have been no reported illness complaints for the product in question, and consumers should discard the meals if they have them and can receive a full refund at any Walmart store. </p><p>No recall has been issued, but FreshRealm, a large food producer that distributed the products, said they advised Walmart this week to pull the meals from store shelves. Additional products may be identified, according to the FSIS. Walmart officials said they put a stop to sales and removed the products from stores. </p><p>The meals may be contaminated with the same strain of listeria that caused an outbreak tied to chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals sold at Walmart and Kroger stores. Four people were killed and at least 20 were sickened in the outbreak, which federal health officials updated on Friday evening. The outbreak <span class="link">led to a large recall this summer</span>.</p><p>"FreshRealm held beef meatball marinara linguine meals after they tested positive for the outbreak strain," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its update Friday. "Pasta that went into the beef meatball marinara linguine meals has tested positive for Listeria, but additional information is pending to determine if the samples taken from the pre-cooked pasta is the same strain making people sick. Do not eat affected foods, return them or throw them out."</p>
<p>FreshRealm conducted tests that detected the listeria in linguine used in the meatball dish, company officials said. The strain matched the listeria identified in the chicken fettuccine Alfredo outbreak, the company said.</p><p>"We have long maintained that the source of the listeria was likely an ingredient supplied by a third party," the company said in a statement.</p><p>The pasta came from Nate's Fine Foods of Roseville, California. The company did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press.</p><p>Listeria infections can cause serious illness, particularly in older adults, people with weakened immune systems, and those who are pregnant or their newborns. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, tiredness, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions, according to the CDC.</p><p>About 1,600 people get sick each year from listeria infections and about 260 die, the CDC says. Federal officials in December said they were revamping protocols to prevent listeria infections after several high-profile outbreaks, including one linked to <span class="link">Boar's Head deli meats</span> that led to 10 deaths and more than 60 illnesses last year. </p>

<div class="article-title">Judge who reviewed Comey indictment confused by prosecutor's handling of case</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Lindsey Vaala expressed confusion and surprise at some points during the seven-minute court session when a federal grand jury impaneled in Alexandria, Virginia,  <span class="link">returned the indictment</span> of former FBI Director James Comey Thursday night.</p><p>According to a transcript of the proceedings obtained by CBS News, Judge Vaala asked the newly named interim U.S. Attorney <span class="link">Lindsey Halligan</span> — a former Trump personal lawyer — why there were two versions of the indictment.</p><p>A majority of the grand jury that reviewed the Comey matter <span class="link">voted not to charge him</span> with one of the three counts presented by prosecutors, according to a form that was signed by the grand jury's foreperson and filed in court. He was indicted on two other counts — making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding — after 14 of 23 jurors voted in favor of them, the foreperson told the judge. </p><p>But two versions of the indictment were published on the case docket: one with the dropped third count, and one without. The transcript reveals why this occurred. </p><p>"So this has never happened before. I've been handed two documents that are in the Mr. Comey case that are inconsistent with one another," Vaala said to Halligan. "There seems to be a discrepancy. They're both signed by the (grand jury) foreperson." </p>
<p>And she noted that one document did not clearly indicate what the grand jury had decided.</p><p>"The one that says it's a failure to concur in an indictment, it doesn't say with respect to one count," Vaala said. "It looks like they failed to concur across all three counts, so I'm a little confused as to why I was handed two things with the same case number that are inconsistent."</p><p>Halligan initially responded that she hadn't seen that version of the indictment.</p><p>"So I only reviewed the one with the two counts that our office redrafted when we found out about the two — two counts that were true billed, and I signed that one. I did not see the other one. I don't know where that came from," Halligan told the judge.</p>
<p>Vaala responded, "You didn't see it?" And Halligan again told her, "I did not see that one."</p><p>Vaala seemed surprised: "So your office didn't prepare the indictment that they —"</p><p>Halligan then replied, "No, no, no — I — no, I prepared three counts. I only signed the one — the two-count (indictment). I don't know which one with three counts you have in your hands."</p><p>"Okay. It has your signature on it," Vaala told Halligan, who responded, "Okay. Well."</p><p>Vaala also noted that the court session began unusually late, at 6:47 p.m. Thursday evening, telling the grand jurors "I don't think we've ever met this late" as she thanked them for their service.</p><p>The charges against Comey — which accuse him of lying in testimony he gave to the Senate in 2020 — mark an unprecedented step for the Justice Department, after President Trump publicly urged prosecutors to look into the ex-FBI leader that he fired in 2017 and sparred with for years. </p><p>In an unusual move, Comey's indictment was personally signed by Halligan, not a rank-and-file federal prosecutor. Halligan was <span class="link">sworn in on Monday</span>, after days of upheaval in the U.S. attorney's office in Alexandria. </p>
<p>The former head of the office, Erik Siebert, <span class="link">announced his resignation on Friday</span> following worries among his staff that he could be fired for failing to criminally charge another Trump adversary, New York Attorney General Letitia James. A day later, Mr. Trump announced Siebert had been fired, and posted a message suggesting Attorney General Pam Bondi should look into Comey, James and a third longtime Trump foil, Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.</p><p>Before Comey was indicted, staff at the U.S. attorney's office circulated a memo that argued charges should not be brought against the former FBI director, a Justice Department source familiar with the matter told CBS News.</p><p>Attorney General Pam Bondi praised Halligan in a post on X Friday, writing that she "did an outstanding job."</p>

<div class="article-title">Travis Decker's cause of death "may never be known," coroner says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The cause of death of <span class="link">Travis Decker</span>, the man accused of killing his three young daughters earlier this year in Washington state before disappearing and sparking a <span class="link">monthslong manhunt</span>, "may never be known," the local county coroner told CBS News on Friday.  </p><p>Chelan County Coroner Wayne Harris told CBS News that Decker's "cause and manner" of death, along with the time of death, couldn't be determined.</p><p>Harris said the coroner's office received only "minimal skeletal remains," and with so much time having passed since the death, "there is nothing to autopsy."</p><p>"The only examination done at this point was by a forensic anthropologist," Harris said in an email Friday. </p><p>Local law enforcement confirmed Thursday that the human remains that were <span class="link">found in Washington state</span> last week came back as a match for Decker after DNA testing.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old, a former Army soldier with extensive survival skills, was the suspect in the May <span class="link">killings of his three daughters</span>, 9-year-old Paityn Decker, 8-year-old Evelyn Decker and 5-year-old Olivia Decker. DNA testing confirmed he was the only suspect in the murders, police have said.</p><p>The search for Decker began May 30, after the girls' mother reported he failed to return them to her Wenatchee, Washington, home, about 100 miles east of Seattle, following a scheduled visit.</p><p>Three days later, authorities discovered the girls' bodies down an embankment at a Cascade Mountains campsite, their wrists bound with zip ties. Autopsies revealed the girls had suffocated, authorities have said.</p>

<div class="article-title">U.S. to impose tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, furniture and heavy trucks</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would impose a new round of tariffs, including a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30% tariff on heavy trucks. </p><p>In social media posts to Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the new tariffs would take effect Oct. 1. </p><p>Mr. Trump said in his posts that the 100% tariff on "any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product" would not apply to companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., which he defined as either "breaking ground" or being "under construction."</p><p>In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shockwaves to voters <span class="link">as health care expenses</span>, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.</p><p>Still, some experts think the new pharma tariffs could end up having only a modest impact, noting that generic drugs are exempt. The loophole for drugmakers with operations in the U.S. is also likely to soften the blow, Neal Shearing, group chief economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.</p>
<p>"Many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies either already have some production in the U.S. or have announced plans to build production in the near future," he said. "Add in the fact that pharmaceuticals is the one area where we think there may have been significant inventory accumulation this year, as importers have sought to front-run potential tariffs, and the impact on the effective tariff rate is likely to be small."</p><h2>Higher costs for home furnishings?</h2><p>Trump argued that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were "flooding" the U.S. with their products and that tariffs must be applied "for National Security and other reasons." </p><p>The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people <span class="link">seeking to buy a house</span> feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.</p><p>Last month, Mr. Trump announced on social media that a "major Tariff Investigation" was being conducted on furniture coming into the U.S. and said that within the next 50 days, the investigation would be completed, and a tariff rate would be announced. </p>
<p>The president said the 25% tariff on "all 'Heavy (Big!) Trucks' made in other parts of the world" was "in order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition." </p><p>"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions," Trump posted.</p><p>Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration's broad tariffs defied predictions that they would fuel inflation, but that respite seems to have ended after <span class="link">economic data this month showed</span> the duties are now driving prices upward. The Consumer Price Index in <span class="link">August rose at a rate of 2.9%</span> from a year ago, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Mr. Trump <span class="link">first launched a sweeping set</span> of import taxes.</p><p>Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.</p><p>"There's no inflation," Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday. "We're having unbelievable success."</p>

<p><em>The new CBS Reports documentary "Boys to Men: Why America's Sons Are Struggling" premieres Saturday, Sept. 27, at 5 p.m. ET on CBS News 24/7 and Paramount+.</em></p><p><em>Oberlin, Ohio —</em> Every other week, Johnny Cole, the founder of Hey Brother, and David Reese, a language arts teacher at Oberlin High School in Oberlin, Ohio, lead a group of more than a dozen high school boys in lessons and discussions focused on the role of men in today's world — a program they call Men's Work.</p><p>"I think boys, in particular, feel this emotional roller coaster, this push and pull of, like, on the one hand, I'm hearing from media and news that I think men should be able to cry," Cole told CBS News. "But I also don't feel like I can express myself, don't have enough adult men in my life that actually model that for me." </p><p>Cole says Hey Brother is an organization that seeks to challenge and examine what it means to be a modern man.</p><p>According to a survey released earlier this year by the Pew Research Center, only 38% of teen boys say they are comfortable talking about their mental health with friends, compared to 58% for teen girls.  </p>
<p>In the same survey, 43% of teen boys said they feel pressure to be physically strong. It's one reason that some young men are drawn to social influencers collectively known as the "manosphere," a term widely used to describe the ecosystem of content aimed at men. </p><p>The Men's Work sessions are designed to discuss and challenge messaging from the "manosphere" that students like Santos Navarro, a senior at Oberlin High, are frequently exposed to online.</p><p>"I like to work out a lot, and I feel like there's a lot of, like, these influencers now that try to tell kids nowadays, use steroids and stuff like that," Navarro said. </p><p>According to a 2023 survey by the American Psychological Association, teens and young adults who reduced their social media use by 50% saw significant improvement in how they felt about their weight and overall appearance.</p>
<p>"There's a pain that's there, and that pain is real and it's authentic," Reese said. "It's understandable, the draw to the manosphere, because, you know, who else is actually talking about some of the struggles of what it means to be a boy, and trying to understand these feelings and emotions? And you're hearing from people who look and sound like they got it all together. It's pain layered on pain that's there. We're just trying to offer a more loving way to move forward."</p>

<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Philadelphia</em> — Just about everyone at a Major League Baseball game wants a foul ball, and 9-year-old Jameson Pennings is no exception.  </p><p>Jameson so wanted a ball earlier this month that his parents, James and Eve Pennings, bought tickets to a Sept. 10 Philadelphia Phillies home game versus the New York Mets, with seats along the third base line, down near where the ball girl sometimes tosses foul balls into the crowd.  </p><p>And sure enough, in the fifth inning, that is exactly what happened.</p><p>"He sat and he cherished it and at one point he's like, 'Dad, is that where the bat hit?'" James told CBS News. "'Oh, yeah, that's where the bat hit.'"</p><p>James thought Jameson would cherish the ball "forever." But forever only lasted four more innings. </p>
<p>"I'm still astounded," James said of what his son did next. </p><p>"I'm very proud of him," Eve added. </p><p>Unbeknownst to his parents, earlier in the game, Jameson overheard a woman talking to that same ball girl. The woman was hoping to get a foul ball for her mother, Donna Morey, who was at the game, celebrating her 80th birthday.</p><p>Unfortunately, getting anyone on the field to toss you a foul ball is a charm offensive that heavily favors the young. Jameson knew the odds of an 80-year-old getting a ball were slim to none. So, he walked over to her, treasure in hand.</p>
<p>"I was so shocked," Morey told CBS News. "I just didn't know what to say. It was unbelievable to me. It really was. And I said, 'Why are you giving it to me?'"</p><p>"I thought, she is way older, and she can't come to many more games, and I can go to more, and get many more balls," Jameson said. </p><p>Donna accepted his gift.</p><p>"It symbolizes goodness in this world," Donna said. </p><p>And Jameson says he is so glad she did, because he's actually happier without it.</p><p>"I will leave feeling really good about myself," Jameson said. "So does it really matter that I left without a ball?"</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump moves to declassify Amelia Earhart records</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump told his administration on Friday to declassify any federal records <span class="link">about Amelia Earhart</span>, the pilot whose 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean has drawn decades of public fascination.</p><p>"Amelia made it almost three quarters around the World before she suddenly, and without notice, vanished, never to be seen again," the president wrote on Truth Social. "Her disappearance, almost 90 years ago, has captivated millions."</p><p>Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared as they flew toward Howland Island in the Pacific, part of her attempt to become the first female aviator to circumnavigate the world. </p><p>It's widely believed that Earhart crashed into the ocean near Howland Island after running out of fuel, says Laurie Gwen Shapiro, a journalist who wrote a book on Earhart. But other theories about where she and her plane ended up have circulated for decades — many of which lack clear evidence. Researchers are <span class="link">planning an expedition</span> to a remote island later this year.</p>
<p>It's not clear what, if any, classified documents the government may have on Earhart.  </p>
<p>But a lawmaker who represents the Northern Mariana Islands territory in the U.S. House pushed Mr. Trump to declassify and release Earhart records earlier this year, referring to "credible, firsthand accounts" that the aviator was spotted on the Pacific island of Saipan.</p><p>"Despite these recollections, her disappearance and the possibility that she may have died on our islands remain matters of unresolved historical inquiry," Del. Kimberlyn King-Hinds, a Republican, wrote in a July letter to the president.</p><p>One of the theories is that Earhart was on a spy mission for the U.S. government when she landed in Saipan and was taken into custody by the Japanese. </p><p>Documents previously released by the FBI contain a 1967 request for a security review of a manuscript that cites Navy files on Earhart that were marked "confidential," a level of classification. The manuscript's author, a senior officer in the Air Force, wrote that the conclusions in the Navy report were that Earhart was not on a spy mission, did not crash-land in Saipan, and was not held as a prisoner or executed as a spy. </p>
<p>The FBI, in approving that manuscript for publication — which is a typical process for current and former government officials — noted that the Navy files did "not warrant classification since the release of it would not be prejudicial to the national defense." </p><p>Shapiro called the theory that Earhart was taken captive in Saipan "nonsense."</p><p>"It's 99.9% that she ran out of gas," Shapiro told CBS News. She said Earhart and Noonan were low on fuel and "very ill-prepared" for their attempted flight to Howland Island, a tiny, difficult-to-find island in the middle of the ocean.</p><p>"It's very boring to tell people, you know what, she ran out of gas," Shapiro said. "The fantasy around it is amazing."</p><p>The National Archives and Records Administration has also previously released documents on the search for Earhart.  </p><p>In 1993, two Hawaiian lawmakers introduced bills in the House and Senate to require the government to release all records relating to Earhart's last flight and disappearance. The bills called for the declassification of any such relevant records that have been classified as government secrets. The measures never made it out of the committees they were referred to. </p><p>Mr. Trump's push to declassify Earhart records follows his decision <span class="link">to release records</span> on the 1960s-era assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr., <span class="link">John F. Kennedy</span> and <span class="link">Robert F. Kennedy</span>. His administration is also under pressure to release records on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump's attacks on Comey could undermine case, legal experts say</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington — </em>The <span class="link">indictment of former FBI Director James Comey</span> on Thursday marked the culmination of President Trump's yearslong desire to see one of his political foes punished after the bureau's investigation into his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian meddling in that election.</p><p>But the president's long-held ire toward Comey, coupled with his latest comments cheering the federal charges brought against the former FBI chief, could aid defense lawyers in a potential bid to have the case against Comey tossed.</p><p>"In this case, the facts before the indictment and even comments Trump made after the indictment provide strong factual evidence that Mr. Comey is the victim of either selective or vindictive prosecution," Gene Rossi, a former federal prosecutor who worked at the Justice Department for nearly 30 years, told CBS News.</p><p>A federal grand jury returned an indictment against Comey charging him with two counts: making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. It declined to indict him on an additional count of lying to Congress, <span class="link">a rare rejection</span> of a proposed charge.</p><p>The charges stem from Comey's September 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which he denied authorizing anyone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports.</p>
<p>Whether to seek an indictment had been met with pushback from career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which is prosecuting the case. Staff in the office had circulated a "declination" memo explaining why criminal charges should not be filed against Comey, a Justice Department source told CBS News.</p><p>But days before Comey was charged, and after <span class="link">the abrupt departure of Erik Siebert</span> as the top prosecutor in the Virginia office, Mr. Trump <span class="link">installed a White House aide</span> and his former personal defense lawyer Lindsey Halligan as Siebert's replacement.</p><p>Halligan has no prosecutorial experience. Only she signed Comey's indictment, and Halligan remains the only attorney listed as representing the U.S.</p><p>Comey denied any wrongdoing, and said in a video shared to social media, "I'm innocent, so let's have a trial and keep the faith." His lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, said Comey will be vindicated in court.</p>
<p>Legal experts expect Fitzgerald will seek to have the case dismissed on numerous grounds, including selective prosecution, which is when the prosecutor appears motivated by discriminatory intent, and vindictive prosecution, when the government acts out of "genuine" animus or seeks to punish a defendant for exercising a legal right. </p><p>Carissa Byrne Hessick, a law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are difficult to prevail on, and it's tough to predict whether Comey will succeed in convincing a judge to dismiss his charges on those grounds.</p><p>Courts are generally hostile to those claims — the legal standard is high for proving them and judges are concerned about opening the floodgates to these types of motions, Hessick said. But on the other hand, Comey's case may look different than others given the events leading up to his indictment, namely the appointment of Halligan and reports of internal disagreement over seeking charges, she said.</p><p>"The mixture of those two things — the fact that these sorts of cases are very hard to win, but also the unusual circumstances and the availability of evidence — I think makes it too difficult to predict what a court will do here," Hessick said.</p><p>Mr. Trump has for years railed against Comey publicly, claiming he should be prosecuted for "treason" and calling him "corrupt," "stupid" and a "dirty cop," among other insults. In a social media post Saturday, the president made a direct appeal to Attorney General Pam Bondi for action against Comey and two other political opponents: New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.</p><p>Mr. Trump wrote the three are "guilty as hell" and said, "We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!"</p><p>The president then cheered Comey's indictment Thursday night.</p>
<p>"One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI," Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. "Today he was indicted by a Grand Jury on two felony counts for various illegal and unlawful acts. He has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"</p><p>The attacks on Comey continued Friday, with Mr. Trump calling him a "destroyer of lives" who must pay a "very big price" for lying.</p><p>"Whether you like Corrupt James Comey or not, and I can't imagine too many people liking him, HE LIED!" Mr. Trump wrote. "It is not a complex lie, it's a very simple, but IMPORTANT one. There is no way he can explain his way out of it. He is a Dirty Cop, and always has been."</p><p>Rossi said the years of comments made by Mr. Trump from the spring of 2017 — when the president fired Comey during his first term — to now, could bolster Comey's bid to have the charges dismissed.</p><p>"Whether vindictive or selective, this animus, the hatred, the prejudice toward who is charged, those emotions and factors become highly relevant," he said.</p><p>But it's not just comments from Mr. Trump that could come into play. Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel also cheered the charges against Comey, with Patel claiming Comey and other top FBI officials weaponized federal law enforcement when they led the bureau.</p><p>"They are putting their thumb on the scale of justice instead of letting Lady Justice handle this matter blindly," Rossi said. "That violates every norm — every norm — that a federal prosecutor is taught from the time they're born as baby prosecutors."</p>
<p>He said the grand jury's rejection of the third count, lying to Congress, is "another brick in the wall" in support of Comey moving to dismiss the charges because of vindictive and selective prosecution, as is the opposition to pursuing an indictment by career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. Under Justice Department policy, prosecutors may pursue indictments only if they believe they can secure a conviction and that conviction will be sustained on appeal.</p><p>"That seasoned and career prosecutors, plus the former U.S. attorney for the EDVA, all said that this indictment doesn't have a legal and factual basis to present to the grand jury, and that [Halligan] was appointed three days before this charge was approved by the grand jury is all ample evidence that something is rotten in Denmark," Rossi said.</p><p>Comey's case is unique compared to others where claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are raised for numerous reasons, Hessick said: It involves people who are newsworthy; there are media reports about the decision to bring charges; Mr. Trump has publicly spoken about action against Comey; and the charges against him appear to involve congressional testimony about investigations into Mr. Trump or Clinton.</p><p>"The case is also notable because this isn't just a question of the motives of the specific prosecutor who brought the charges," she said. "It's also about the president's decisions to speak publicly about a case that's a high-profile political case."</p><p>Hessick said that in previous administrations, presidents are often — but not always — careful not to comment about ongoing cases.</p><p>Mr. Trump sought to have criminal charges brought against him by former special counsel Jack Smith in each of the two cases dismissed for vindictive and selective prosecution, but one of the requests was denied. The two cases, one involving the 2020 election and the other involving Mr. Trump's handling of sensitive government documents after his first term, were <span class="link">dismissed</span> <span class="link">after he won</span> a second term in the White House.</p><p>Hunter Biden, former President Joe Biden's son, also unsuccessfully sought to have his indictment on tax charges dismissed on the same grounds, arguing the investigation into him was "compromised by politics."</p>
<p>Hunter Biden <span class="link">pleaded guilty to the charges</span> last year.</p>

<div class="article-title">Assata Shakur dies in Cuba after decades on the run</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Assata Shakur, a Black Liberation Army member who was convicted of murdering a state trooper in 1973 and lived in Cuba for decades, has died, authorities said Friday. </p><p>Shakur, also known as Joanne Chesimard,  died in Havana "due to health conditions and advanced age" on Thursday, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a news release. </p><p>She was born JoAnne Deborah Byron in Queens, New York, in July 1947, BET News reported. In 1967, she married Louis Chesimard. The pair divorced in 1970. </p>
<p>Shakur was attached to Black nationalist movements, including the Black Panther Party and the Black Liberation Army, which called for armed resistance against systemic racism and planned assassinations of <span class="link">law enforcement members</span> in multiple U.S. cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Atlanta. In 2013, former FBI assistant director <span class="link">John Miller told CBS News</span> that she was "the soul of the Black Liberation Army" and had been a leader of the group. </p><p>She was charged with multiple crimes in the early 1970s, including a bank robbery. In 1973, she was involved in a shootout on the New Jersey Turnpike. The incident left state trooper Werner Foerster and Black Liberation Army member Zayd Malik Shakur dead. Assata Shakur was wounded in the incident. She was arrested and convicted of murdering Foerster, as well as seven other felony charges related to the shooting. She was sentenced to life in prison. </p>
<p>In 1979, Shakur escaped the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey. Miller said the escape, which saw two men smuggled into the prison to take guards hostage and break her out, was "incredibly daring." In 1984, she was smuggled to Mexico, Miller said, then transported to Cuba, where she was granted political asylum by the Castro government. </p>
<p>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and State Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan said in a statement Friday, "For years, we have worked with the State Department to bring Chesimard back to New Jersey, so she could face justice for the cold-blooded murder of an American hero. Sadly, it appears she has passed without being held fully accountable for her heinous crimes."</p><p>Shakur lived openly in Cuba, publishing an autobiography in 1987. Miller said she taught at Cuban universities. In 2013, she was placed on the FBI's Most Wanted terrorist list, becoming the first woman to be added. The reward for her capture was $2 million, but she was <span class="link">largely shielded from extradition</span> to the U.S., Miller said. </p>
<p>Activists saw her as a symbol of resistance to racial injustice and government repression, CBS News previously reported. </p><p>Shakur was the step-aunt and godmother of slain rapper Tupac Shakur.</p>

<div class="article-title">Supreme Court lets Trump withhold $4 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington — </em>The Supreme Court on Friday allowed President Trump's administration to <span class="link">withhold more than $4 billion</span> in foreign aid funding, granting its request for emergency relief in a dispute over money that Congress has already approved.</p><p>The high court's decision follows an order that Chief Justice John Roberts had issued earlier this month, which <span class="link">temporarily froze</span> a district court injunction requiring the Trump administration to spend the money Congress appropriated for foreign-aid projects by the end of September. The court appeared to divide 6-3, with Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court's three liberals, dissenting.</p><p>The Supreme Court said in an unsigned order that the harm to the executive branch's ability to conduct foreign affairs appears to outweigh the potential harm faced by the plaintiffs, which are organizations and businesses that receive funding for foreign aid projects. It added that the decision "should not be read as a final determination on the merits. The relief granted by the Court today reflects our preliminary view, consistent with the standards for interim relief."</p><h2>The legal fight over foreign aid</h2><p>The dispute before the justices involves a tranche of more than $4 billion Congress approved last year for overseas development assistance, peacekeeping operations and to promote democracy globally, among other priorities. Mr. Trump <span class="link">notified Congress</span> last month that he is seeking to claw back $4.9 billion before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30 through a maneuver known as a "pocket rescission."</p><p>The Government Accountability Office has said the move is illegal.</p>
<p>But the Supreme Court said in its decision that at this stage in the proceedings, the government "has made a sufficient showing" that the Impoundment Control Act, the mechanism for the president to move to cancel congressionally approved federal funding, precludes the plaintiffs' suit. That lawsuit sought to make the president comply with appropriations law passed last year.</p><p>In a dissenting opinion, Kagan said the stakes in the case are high, as it involves the allocation of power between the executive branch and Congress.</p><p>"[T]he consequence of today's grant is significant. I appreciate that the majority refrains from offering a definitive view of this dispute and the questions raised in it," she wrote. "But the effect of its ruling is to allow the Executive to cease obligating $4 billion in funds that Congress appropriated for foreign aid, and that will now never reach its intended recipients. Because that result conflicts with the separation of powers, I respectfully dissent."</p><p>U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled in early September that the administration's refusal not to spend congressionally approved funds is likely illegal under a federal law governing the agency rule-making process. The judge said the Trump administration could withhold the funding only if Congress rescinded it through duly enacted legislation.</p>
<p>The dispute was brought by nonprofit organizations and development companies in February after the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause of <span class="link">foreign development assistance</span> to review whether programs were consistent with the president's foreign policy. </p><p>It has since ping-ponged <span class="link">through the courts,</span> including the Supreme Court back in March. Then, the high court split 5-4 in deciding to <span class="link">leave in place</span> an order from Ali that required the Trump administration to pay roughly $2 billion in invoices for foreign-aid work that had already been performed.</p><p>In the latest development in the case, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled last month that the nonprofits and businesses could not sue on grounds the administration violated the separation of powers by unilaterally declining to spend congressionally approved foreign-aid funds. The panel voted 2-1 to wipe away an order from Ali that had prohibited the government from withholding the money Congress appropriated last year for foreign assistance programs.</p><p>But the D.C. Circuit panel later issued an amended opinion that opened up an avenue for the nonprofits and businesses to seek relief on different legal grounds. On the heels of that decision, Mr. Trump informed Congress of his plan to rescind the $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding, which he said supported "wasteful" programs that did not align with his "America First" foreign policy agenda.</p><p>The plaintiffs then filed a new request for preliminary relief with Ali, and the judge found that the Trump administration had a duty to comply with Congress's directives by spending the $4 billion by the end of September, when the fiscal year ends.</p><p>The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit to freeze Ali's latest order. After the appeals court declined to do so, the administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene.</p><p>In a filing with the high court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the district court's injunction "raises a grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers."</p>
<p>"The President can hardly speak with one voice in foreign affairs or in dealings with Congress when the district court is forcing the Executive Branch to advocate against its own objectives," Sauer wrote.</p><p>The solicitor general said Ali's injunction "puts the executive branch at war with itself" by requiring it to spend the same $4 billion that the president wants to claw back.</p><p>But lawyers for the plaintiffs said that the government has been obligated to spend the money approved by Congress for specific purposes since at least March 2024. They wrote in a filing that the appropriations legislation enacted by Congress last year remains binding on the executive branch.</p><p>"[T]he upshot of the government's theory is that Congress's signature law meant to control impoundments actually provided the President vast new powers to impound funds, and made it virtually impossible to challenge impoundments in court," the lawyers said. "Congress would not have enacted such a self-defeating statute."</p><p>The plaintiffs warned that allowing the president to withhold the money for foreign assistance would threaten the viability of groups that receive federal dollars for projects overseas. For one of the organizations, Democracy International, 98% of its revenues in 2024 came from awards from the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to court filings. Lawyers warned the company would be at risk of bankruptcy if the expiring appropriations are not spent.</p><p>"The pocket rescission of democracy promotion funds is an existential threat to Democracy International," the plaintiffs wrote.</p>

<p>Two major TV station owners, Sinclair Broadcasting and Nexstar Media Group, announced on Friday that they are returning "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" to their ABC stations, ending the <span class="link">preemption of the late-night show</span> over remarks Kimmel had made following <span class="link">the shooting death</span> of conservative activist <span class="link">Charlie Kirk</span>. </p><p>Sinclair said in a statement Friday afternoon that the show will be back on the air on its ABC affiliates tonight, and a few hours later later, Nexstar announced it's bringing the show back tonight as well. Sinclair owns 38 ABC stations across the U.S. and Nexstar owns 33.</p><p>Disney's ABC <span class="link">brought Kimmel's show back</span> on Tuesday following a six-day suspension, but stations owned by Sinclair and Nexstar — about a quarter of the network's affiliates — had <span class="link">continued to air</span> other programming in that time slot instead.</p><p>"Our objective throughout this process has been to ensure that programming remains accurate and engaging for the widest possible audience," Sinclair said in its statement.

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Ten years ago, professional tattoo artist Brian Finn decided to use his talents to help people — by providing free or reduced cost tattoos on his day off for people with scars caused by trauma</p> <p>"It just kind of hit me one day that I had the tools to do something to help people. So, I kind of rolled with it," Finn says.</p>
<p>NPR first spoke with Finn in 2015 when he started tattooing clients on his day off.</p> <p>After that interview, he says, the requests started pouring in. He's done thousands of tattoos for people wanting to cover up scars from domestic abuse, human trafficking, self-harm and more. Finn, who has been tattooing for more than 30 years, says tattoos carry different meanings for everyone.</p> <p>"Some people, you know, they want to cover up a scar with a tattoo so they can't see it. But there's a lot of people, too, that came in … they wanted to kind of highlight it," he says. "Everybody's different. And I think both are great ideas and just a different approach depending on what you want to do."</p>
<p>He says after our 2015 interview, the requests were not just coming from potential customers.</p>
<p>He offers advice to tattoo artists who want to offer a similar service. And he's found a community of like minded artists. "There's people that reached out from all across the world, different tattoo shops, different tattooers saying: 'Hey, I heard that on NPR. I'm kind of following suit and I'm doing the same thing.'"</p> <p>Finn says that the work hasn't always been easy. When he first started, he wasn't anticipating the emotional toll.</p> <p>"Emotionally, it was … there was a lot of pain to hear on a daily basis," he says, recounting working with people who have experienced trauma.</p> <p>"The only thing that's really changed is that I think it's less overwhelming … hearing everybody's story all at once was more than I expected."</p>
<p>Ten years on, Finn says he plans to keep going.</p> <p>"I don't see any reason to stop," he says.</p> <p>"It's nice to help people out."</p> <p><em>To tell us your own story about how being a volunteer has shaped your life or nominate someone you think we should profile, fill out </em><em>this form</em><em>.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">How the beloved state fair grew from livestock showcases to cornucopias of amusement</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>There's something for everyone at a state fair — petting zoos, live music, fried foods.</p> <p>For many states in the U.S., summer to fall is the season for the annual state fair. The country's first state fair dates to the 19th century, when locals would showcase livestock, crafts and agriculture.</p> <p>State fairs of today share the same elements, but have evolved into something like pop-up theme parks. They remain a favorite American pastime, contributing $30 billion to the U.S. economy each year, said David Grindle, CEO of the International Association of Fairs &amp; Expositions.</p> <p>Here's a look at how state fairs began, and what keeps them going year after year.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">The state fair's agricultural roots remain</h3> <p>State fairs began as agricultural competitions, which the British brought with them as they colonized North America, said Nick Pirro, who the New York State Fair has deemed its unofficial resident historian. (He's officially their graphic designer and website manager.) They served as spaces where farmers could show off their livestock and inform the public, according to the UK's House of Commons.</p>
<p>Once the colonies began developing governments and counties, county fairs took off. Then those counties grew into states, and people eventually developed an appetite for something more grandiose, Pirro said.</p> <p>Thus, in 1841, the state fair was born. The first one was held in Syracuse, N.Y. There were plowing competitions and animal exhibits — not far off from what you would see at a fair today. Other areas that weren't yet states followed New York, including what is now Minnesota and Iowa, Pirro said.</p> <p>"It grew because, as you got more and more county fairs, [it's] our natural desire as humans to show off and be competitive," Grindle said.</p> <p>Now, fair contestants show off all kinds of things — flowers, outfits and cakes — in play for those coveted ribbons. But agriculture is still everywhere at fairs. It's a common thread in the food and drinks offered, the jobs supported and the crops flaunted, Pirro said.</p>
<p>"The driving force is agriculture," Pirro said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Showcasing arts and crafts</h3> <p>Crafts have an early presence at state fairs, too. But back then, displays and demonstrations were a matter of function. They were useful for determining things like the types of wool a sheep might produce, or showing off the latest manufacturing or blacksmith techniques, said Mary Savig, the curator-in-charge of the Smithsonian's Renwick Gallery, an arm of the American Art Museum in Washington, D.C. One of the gallery's current exhibits is "State Fairs: Growing American Craft."</p>
<p>Demonstrations are still present. But today, the menagerie serves many purposes — educating, entertaining, and showcasing local artists, talent and trends.</p> <p>For example, in the 19th century, Victorian hair wreaths (made from human hair) were all the rage throughout the country, said Savig. She traveled to various state fairs to curate the Renwick exhibit. She said more recently, "diamond" art has become popular, in which people make portraits, or recreate famous artworks out of crystals.</p> <p>And as a tongue-in-cheek homage to fair food, some crafters have begun constructing quilts-on-a-stick at the Minnesota State Fair, for example. They're mini quilts about the size of a sheet of printer paper that artists poke skewers through.</p> <p>"It's a pretty small project and it's very accessible to people, especially new quilters," Savig said.</p> <p>In Mississippi, the Choctaw Indian Princess is crowned each year at the Choctaw Indian Fair, in which the contestants often make their own garments with elaborate beading and embroidery work. In Minnesota, there are contests for rosemaling, a Norwegian folk art, which is characterized by intricate patterns of flowers and swirls.</p> <p>Some of these works have made their way to the nation's capital for the Renwick Gallery's exhibit, which runs through next year. The works include a cow made out of 700 pounds of butter, which will sit in a custom, 38 degrees Fahrenheit case.</p>
<p>"On artists, [fairs] have had historically, a really important impact, just as far as validating an artist's skills, also giving them a platform to show their work and be recognized," Savig said. "I think it's encouraged a lot of artists to continue their work in various ways."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Fried foods and music stars came later</h3> <p>Food and entertainment has certainly taken off, as neither were common at early fairs. There was no electricity back then.</p> <p>"Once the fair ended for the day, it's like, 'What are these people going to do?' So they had to occupy themselves," Pirro said.</p>
<p>That usually meant going to taverns and bars, and enduring long travel days by horse and buggy. New York fairgoers eventually grew tired of this, Pirro said. So the Ka-Noo-No Karnival debuted in Syracuse in 1905 – alongside the state fair – as a way to keep people in town. It was a parade that had string lights lining the floats' path, allowing attendees to get a peek at the new wonders of electricity, Pirro said.</p>
<p>Now? "We can keep the lights on…and keep them well-fed with anything and everything that you can deep fry nowadays," he said.</p> <p>There are fried Oreos, Snickers and pickles. French fries and funnel cakes. The largest bagel Guinness World Records has on file (868 pounds) was shown at the New York State Fair in 2004. You can also get turkey legs the size of your forearm — plenty to chow down on while taking in crowd-favorites, from pigs racing, to future megastars like Taylor Swift, who first performed at the New York State Fair in 2007.</p> <p>The beauty of the state fair, Grindle says, is that no two are alike.</p> <p>"If you've been to one fair, you've been to one," Grindle said. "They are all so beautifully unique. They are so reflective of the things going on in their communities that I really encourage people to get out and explore them to see what's going on and ask questions."<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">As federal funds wane, NPR ruefully clashes with CPB</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>NPR asked a federal judge to block the Corporation for Public Broadcasting from awarding a $57.9 million grant to a new consortium of public media institutions to operate the satellite that connects the public radio system for the next five years.</p>
<p>NPR's submission, filed Friday afternoon, gives insight into the behind-the-scenes tensions within public media this year as Congressional Republicans successfully moved, at President Trump's insistence, to strip public broadcasting of all funding they had already approved for the next two years.</p> <p>NPR has run the satellite-based system for more than four decades. It enables hundreds of public radio stations and other outside producers to air and share programming, including many shows and stations with no affiliation with NPR itself. CPB is the Congressionally funded private corporation through which federal money is funneled to public radio and TV stations, PBS and, to a lesser extent, NPR.</p>
<p>The money at issue is not part of the money NPR receives toward its own annual operations, which has typically represented 1% to 2% of its operating budget. PBS and its member stations have, on average, received 15% of their budgets from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting; for public radio stations, that figure has been roughly 10%, though the figure has varied widely.</p> <p>That subsidy for all public media evaporates starting Wednesday with the new federal fiscal year.</p> <p>The federal funding for the public radio satellite distribution system is calculated separately from the money set aside for NPR and its member stations.</p>
<p>According to NPR's court submissions, NPR had been told by CPB in early April that it would soon receive more than $30 million to cover the next three years for running the service, plus the balance on the current year. CPB then swiftly reversed course, with an executive citing a decision at the CPB board level saying NPR could not be involved, the court filing alleges.</p> <p>Earlier Friday, CPB had announced it was giving the contract to the new consortium, called Public Media Infrastructure. Its members include New York Public Radio, PRX, the Minnesota-based American Public Media, and Station Resource Group, a consulting firm. The National Federation of Community Broadcasters, an association of smaller stations that are not part of the NPR network, is also participating.</p>
<p>"By awarding this grant to PMI, CPB is placing trust in stations to drive the future of radio content distribution, ensuring that interconnection is not only reliable but also innovative, representative and sustainable," CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison said in a statement. "This decision reflects CPB's commitment to support the entire public media system, especially rural and community stations, and to prepare the system for the future."</p> <p>NPR and three of its Colorado member stations are already suing the White House over Trump's May order banning CPB from spending any federal money on NPR, saying it is a violation of its Constitutional protections. Trump has called NPR and PBS "monsters" and accused them of bias. NPR says that demonstrates an unlawful retaliation for its exercise of free speech.</p>
<p>"We seek a clear judgment that finds the illegality and unconstitutionality of this executive order, and, in doing so, establishes definitively that public media enjoys the same protections from viewpoint discrimination as any other entity of the free press," NPR Chief Executive Katherine Maher wrote to member station officials Friday evening.</p> <p>"We enter into this motion with great reluctance," she continued. "This decision has undercut the bonds between our two organizations forged over many decades of service to the American people, and stands as a regretful coda to CPB's prior history of support for the First Amendment."</p> <p>In the motion Friday for a temporary restraining order, its executives attest to their shock at learning of the CPB's decision, saying it reflects the corporation bending to the Trump administration's will.</p> <p>"CPB is now poised to do the Order's bidding, in contravention of both the First Amendment and the express mandates of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967," states NPR's legal team, led by Miguel A. Estrada and Theodore J. Boutros, Jr.</p> <p>While CPB, NPR and PBS maintained a seemingly united front during an intensely pitched campaign to hold off the elimination of taxpayer subsidies, privately executives for CPB and PBS distanced themselves from NPR and Maher.</p>
<p>Three people with knowledge of events say CPB and PBS officials told some lawmakers they would be content if subsidies could be preserved for public media, especially the stations, even if NPR were not to receive further federal funding. They spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying they did not have authorization to speak publicly on the highly politically charged matter.</p> <p>Trump has publicly attacked NPR and PBS but it is the radio network that has drawn greater scrutiny for ideological bias, sparked in part by an accusatory essay in 2024 from a senior business editor who later left the network.</p> <p>During House hearings in late March, Republicans cast a severe light on Maher's years-old social media posts prior to her joining NPR early last year that reflected a liberal sensibility and support for Joe Biden's 2020 presidential bid.</p> <p>On April 2, according to statements from NPR executives filed along with its legal petition, a top CPB executive, Kathy Merritt, affirmed that the corporation had approved NPR's contract extension. The CPB agreed to transfer more than $35 million to fulfill the rest of the current contract and the new one, court papers say.</p>
<p>On April 14, the same day published reports reflected Trump's renewed effort to shear away all federal taxpayer subsidies for public media, CPB's Merritt "called NPR's Chief Operating Officer to inform him that CPB now wanted to provide PRSS funding to a separate entity, with the principal criterion for eligibility being that the entity lack any ties to NPR," according to the network's legal filings.</p> <p>Trump issued his formal rescission request to Congress on May 1. Shortly before the rescission vote in the summer, Trump publicly told Republicans in Congress that he would not campaign for anyone who failed to support the measure.</p> <p>Two weeks later, NPR announced a new initiative designed to provide what it called "best-in-class terrestrial distribution platform for live broadcast that is expected to transform how public radio stations receive programming across America." CPB continued to put the contract out for bidding nonetheless.</p>
<p>In the Friday court documents, NPR contends CPB's move to sever its contract to run the system "threatens NPR's contractual relationships with the Interconnected Stations and undermines the hard-earned trust that NPR has built with those stations over decades of service."</p> <p>NPR says without a restraining order, it will be unable to win back the contract in court, as CPB will be all but extinct. A skeleton crew will continue on to wind down CPB's operations.</p> <p>Through its chief spokesperson, CPB said late Friday it was "confident that our actions serve the best interests of the future of public radio."</p> <p>"We are disappointed that, at a time of tremendous challenge for all public media with substantially diminished resources, NPR is forcing CPB to expend scarce funds that would otherwise support the public media system in defending a lawsuit that has no merits and ultimately does not benefit the system," CPB stated.</p>
<p>In her note to station officials, Maher said that NPR's paramount concern involved "the integrity and stability of the public radio system." Maher said she had promised the new Public Media Infrastructure coalition that NPR would work with it to ensure that the system remained "vital and robust."</p> <p>The federal judge overseeing the case, Randolph D. Moss, has ordered a hearing on NPR's motion for Tuesday morning - the day before the federal funding of public media goes away.</p> <p><em>Disclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik.

<div class="article-title">Supreme Court allows Trump to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the way for the Trump administration to continue to withhold over $4 billion in foreign aid already approved by Congress.</p> <p>Earlier this month, a federal judge in Washington, D.C. ordered the administration to release billions in foreign aid funds by the end of September — which the administration later appealed.</p> <p>On Friday, the justices voted 6-3 along ideological lines to allow the administration to freeze the foreign aid funds. The court's conservatives said Trump's foreign policy authority outweighed the harms claimed by the international aid groups suing and suggested that the groups may not have the standing to sue.</p>
<p>In the dissent, Justice Elena Kagan took issue with the way the ruling was reached, which was through the emergency docket.</p> <p>"We have had to consider this application on a short fuse — less than three weeks. We have done so with scant briefing, no oral argument, and no opportunity to deliberate in conference," Kagan wrote. </p> <p>Last month, President Trump informed House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., that he will not be spending $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid through a controversial and rare authority known as a pocket rescission.</p>
<p>Typically, lawmakers have 45 days to consider a request to rescind or cancel appropriated funds. But when a request comes close to the end of a budget year, the president may bypass the legislative branch. A pocket rescission has not been used since the 1970s.</p> <p>The pocket rescission includes targeting funds for development assistance grants, the United Nations, and international peacekeeping operations</p>

<div class="article-title">Assata Shakur, a fugitive Black militant sought by the U.S. since 1979, dies in Cuba</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Assata Shakur, a Black liberation activist who was given political asylum in Cuba after her 1979 escape from a U.S. prison where she had been serving a life sentence for killing a police officer, has died, her daughter and the Cuban government said.</p>
<p>Shakur, who was born Joanne Deborah Chesimard, died Thursday in the capital city of Havana due to "health conditions and advanced age," Cuba's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. Shakur's daughter, Kakuya Shakur, confirmed her mother's death in a Facebook post.</p> <p>Officials in New Jersey, where Shakur had been arrested, convicted and imprisoned, said she was 78.</p> <p>A member of Black Panther Party and Black Liberation Army, Shakur's case had long been emblematic of the fraught relations between the U.S. and Cuba. American authorities, including President Trump during his first term, demanded her return from the communist nation for decades.</p>
<p>The FBI put Shakur on its list of " most wanted terrorists," but, in her telling — and in the minds of her supporters — she was pursued for crimes she didn't commit or that were justified.</p> <p>On May 2, 1973, Shakur and two others were pulled over by New Jersey State Police troopers because the car they were driving had a broken taillight.</p>
<p>A gunfight ensued and one of the troopers, Werner Foerster, was killed and another was wounded. One of Shakur's companions was also killed.</p> <p>The New York City native fled but was eventually apprehended. She was found guilty of murder, armed robbery and other crimes in 1977 and was sentenced to life in prison. Shakur was charged with additional bank robberies and in the nonfatal shootings of two other police officers, but most of those charges were dismissed or resulted in her acquittal.</p> <p>Shakur's prison stint was short-lived, though. In November 1979, members of the Black Liberation Army, posing as visitors, stormed the Clinton Correctional Facility for women, took two guards hostage and commandeered a prison van to break her out.</p> <p>Shakur disappeared before eventually emerging in 1984 in Cuba, where Fidel Castro granted her asylum.</p> <p>Offering Shakur safe harbor was one of the most famous examples of Cuba aligning itself with what it describes as revolutionary forces struggling against the oppressive capitalist empire to the north.</p>
<p>Much like Cuba supported anti-colonial and left-wing forces in Africa, Central and South America, the Cuban government saw the armed Black liberation movement in the U.S. as part of a global revolutionary struggle.</p> <p>New Jersey State Assemblyman Michael Inganamort, who sponsored a resolution last year calling on Cuba to extradite Shakur, lamented Friday that "justice was never served" in Foerster's death, while the labor union representing New Jersey officers dismissed Shakur "for her crime and cowardice."</p> <p>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and State Police Superintendent Patrick Callahan said they would "vigorously oppose" any attempt to repatriate Shakur's remains to the U.S.</p> <p>"Sadly, it appears she has passed without being held fully accountable for her heinous crimes," they said in a joint statement. "Unlike his killer, Trooper Foerster never had a chance to live out his days in peace."</p> <p>Sundiata Acoli, who was also convicted in Foerster's killing, was granted parole in 2022 after being imprisoned for nearly three decades.</p> <p>In her writings over the years, Shakur has maintained she didn't shoot anyone and had her hands in the air when she was wounded during the gunfire.</p> <p>More recently, her writings became a rallying cry during the Black Lives Matter movement, though opponents criticized her words as being influenced by Marxist and communist ideology.</p> <p>"It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win," Shakur wrote in <em>Assata: An Autobiography,</em> originally published in 1988. "We must love each other and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains."</p> <p>Black Lives Matter Grassroots Inc., a collective of racial justice activists from around the U.S., vowed to "fight in her honor and memory."</p>
<p>Malkia Amala Cyril, an early organizer of the BLM movement, expressed sorrow because Shakur died during a time of rising authoritarianism.</p> <p>"The world in this era needs the kind of courage and radical love she practiced if we are going to survive it," said Cyril, whose late mother had been part of the Black Panthers in New York alongside Shakur.</p> <p>Shakur's influence extended into the music world. She was famously close to the family of late rapper Tupac Shakur, who had considered her a godmother.</p>
<p>Public Enemy, the political hip-hop group and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees, are thought to be the first major artists to reference Shakur. The 1988 song <em>Rebel Without a Pause,</em> from the album <em>It Takes A Nation,</em> includes the lyrics "supporter of Chesimard," referring to her legal name.</p> <p>Rapper Common told Shakur's story in his 2000 song <em>A Song for Assata.</em> The Grammy award-winner's invitation to a White House poetry event in 2011, during the Obama administration, drew outrage from conservatives and law enforcement groups who felt it was disrespectful to Foerster's family and police officers broadly.</p>

<div class="article-title">An influx of federal agents will arrive in Memphis next week, governor says</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Starting Monday, an influx of federal agents will be deployed across Memphis as part of a broader push in what President Trump has described as a crackdown on crime.</p> <p>At a news conference on Friday, Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said personnel from 13 U.S. agencies will arrive in the city next week. That will include agents from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The operation will also include 300 troopers from the Tennessee Highway Patrol.</p>
<p>It remains unclear exactly how many members of the National Guard will be deployed, but the governor said troops will be in support roles and not tasked with making arrests. He added that the Guard will not be armed unless it is requested by local law enforcement.</p> <p>Lee said the operation is set to occur in phases over the "next weeks and months." The governor said "planning has been underway for months" about bringing in federal resources to curb crime, calling it a "generational opportunity."</p> <p>" The story of crime in Memphis is about to be a story of the past," he added.</p> <p>Memphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, said Friday that he recognizes that community members have many questions and strong feelings — both for and against — the upcoming federal partnership.</p> <p>"As the leader of our city, my goal is to make sure that as resources come into our community we find ways to use them effectively and for the benefit of the residents of our great city," he said.</p> <p>Young noted that Memphis has made progress in reducing crime, and specifically violent crime, after a spike in 2023. The city is already participating in several joint state and federal task forces, including with the FBI, U.S. Marshals and ICE.</p>
<p>The city government launched a website to provide updates and information on the federal resources that will be coming in.</p>
<p>Trump has previously described Memphis as "suffering from tremendous levels of violent crime that have overwhelmed its local government's ability to respond effectively." Earlier this month, he signed a presidential memorandum to establish a federal task force to combat crime in the city, characterizing it as a "replica" of what he has done in Washington, D.C.</p> <p>The Trump administration has been accused of unfairly targeting Democratic-led cities. Federal troops were previously sent to Los Angeles and D.C., both of which are run by Democratic mayors, similar to Memphis. Trump has also voiced interest in sending troops to Chicago, New Orleans and St. Louis.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>NEW YORK — It's the first United Nations General Assembly since President Donald Trump shook up the foreign aid landscape by cutting billions of dollars in assistance.</p> <p>"There's a lot of anxiety, apprehension. It's almost like everybody's waiting for the other shoe to drop," says Solomon Zewdu, the CEO of The END Fund, a group that focuses on eliminating neglected tropical diseases.</p> <p>He's one of thousands of people from all over the world who descended on Manhattan for a week of high-level meetings at the 80th session of the U.N. General Assembly.</p> <p>NPR reporters were on the ground in New York and spoke with global health leaders about their impressions of the week. Here's what they told us – edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Solomon Zewdu, the CEO of The END Fund</strong></p> <p>Dr. Solomon Zewdu is based in South Africa and he says the thing that struck him most this General Assembly is that global health leaders are "talking in silos."</p>
<p>"We're not hearing each other," he says. Some are having conversations about how dependent countries are on aid, while others are lamenting the cuts.</p> <p>"But now, what's the next step? Let's move on. There's urgency. Time kills people," he says.</p> <p>He's afraid "everybody's going to scatter, and then we might wait for the next summit to happen — and, in between, people dying, people's health is being compromised."</p>
<p><strong>Varnee Murugan</strong><strong>, senior director of the Global Initiative on Health and the Economy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce</strong></p> <p>Murugan left the General Assembly enthused by the new U.S. global health strategy and its emphasis on bringing private-sector companies back into the global health arena.</p> <p>"In the past, the private sector has been seen as, in some cases, tangential, in other cases, as an opponent," she says.</p> <p>She argues for-profit businesses have a lot to offer. "There is the bottom line — and that's always going to exist — but there are also broader objectives."</p> <p>She says they have a lot of knowledge to contribute as well as the ability to "really help local economies grow and prosper and then transition away from aid and more towards sustainable trade."</p>
<p><strong>Atul Satija, CEO of the </strong><strong>Nudge Institute</strong><strong> </strong></p> <p>Atul Satija lives in India, where he leads a non-profit organization that addresses poverty in his country. He says he senses a difference in the U.N. event this year.</p>
<p>"The quality of conversations is slightly deeper," says Satija. "It is a lot about the problems that we are facing globally, and how we can collectively solve them. So I am enjoying it because it's a lot more real."</p> <p>With people around the world losing health care and education opportunities because of the U.S. cuts, Staija says that "people are figuring out new ways to design solutions so that communities are not affected as much."</p> <p>But he is also troubled by what the future might hold: "What keeps me up at night is: Do we have the space and the quiet to do the work we want to do?"</p> <p><strong>Peter Sands, CEO of the Global Fund</strong></p> <p>Peter Sands says this year's General Assembly feels a bit like being on a "high wire."</p> <p>"This is, kinda, of moment of reckoning. On the negative side: There have been cuts in funding, disruptions to services. But on the positive side: We've got some extraordinarily exciting scientific innovations," he says. "There's a lot to lose, but there's also a lot to achieve."</p> <p>His mind is focused on the money bit of the equation. The Global Fund is busy trying to raise money for its next three year cycle. And, afterall, Sands is a former banker — he was the CEO of Standard Chartered PLC, one of the world's major international banks.</p> <p>"As somebody who spent a lot of my life doing return on investment, investing in global health is one of the highest return on investment things you can do," he says, pointing to the economic growth and health gains that come from fighting diseases.</p> <p><strong>Jackie Aldrette, executive director of </strong><strong>AVSI-USA</strong></p> <p>Jackie Aldrette hasn't been to a U.N. General Assembly in years. But this time, she felt it was important to attend.</p> <p>Her U.S.-based organization, which supports marginalized communities around the world, is one of many aid groups that lost funding because of the U.S. cuts.</p>
<p>"I came wanting to kind of gain more clarity about what we should focus on," says Aldrette.</p> <p>"I definitely felt a kind of this new energy," she says. "Like a fire underneath in terms of finding ways of working for the causes we care about, and the realization that it's better to do that together."</p> <p>Her favorite moment of the week? "I found myself in conversation with someone from a very well-established organization, with whom I was able to just share a kind of dream I've been cooking up and she got excited and shared with me her dream," she says. "And so, we were kind of dreaming together."</p> <p>She also had an epiphany about the U.S. aid cuts: "It feels like the U.S. doesn't have a seat at the table anymore," Aldrette says. "But there was also hope because it wasn't like the lack of U.S. presence meant the table collapsed. No, we were still at that table, so we can go on."<br/></p>

<p>An Immigration and Customs officer working at the New York immigration courts has been placed on administrative leave after video circulated online showed him pushing a woman toward a wall and to the ground, according to the Department of Homeland Security. </p> <p>The man appears to be the same officer involved in an arrest of a court observer last month, which was witnessed by NPR and caught on audio.</p>

Javits building at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City:</em></p> <p>There have been growing tensions between federal law enforcement and the public in immigration courts as federal agents are tasked with making more arrests. Over the last five months, ICE has increased its footprint inside immigration courthouses, which are operated by the Justice Department. The agents' presence and arrests in courthouses, particularly in New York, have resulted in conflicting mandates and instances of explosive anger, as NPR previously reported.</p>
<p>In August, as NPR and a court observer — an immigrant advocate — entered the hall, federal enforcement brushed past. The agent, who was unmasked and had been sitting in the waiting area earlier, yelled at NPR: "stop f****** following me! Why are you f****** following me?" before turning and yelling the same thing at the court observer.</p> <p>"It's not f****** about you!" she retorted.</p> <p>As they turned the corner, more shouting could be heard.</p> <p>"Don't f****** touch me," the court observer yelled. "Why are you pushing me? Why are you shoving me? I am not following you!"</p> <p>She was then taken into an enclosed elevator bay.</p> <p>At the time, DHS told NPR that the court observer had interrupted the agents. She was transferred to Federal Protective Service custody and issued two citations: trespassing in a secure area and failing to follow lawful commands from an officer.</p> <p>The latest incident, caught on several cell phones and cameras, shows a woman crying apparently after the arrest of her husband.</p> <p>The agent was captured yelling "adios" (or goodbye) several times before shoving the woman toward the wall and onto the floor before the crowd.</p>
