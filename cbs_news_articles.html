                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.</p><p>Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. "I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent," he told CBS News.</p><p>Experts say the skilled trades — jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing — are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs. </p><p>More recently, signs that <span class="link">artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up</span> the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 42% of Gen Zers are today working in or pursuing a blue-collar or skilled trade job, according to a recent survey of 1,434 people by job-search firm ResumeBuilder.com. </p>
<p>"That route is losing some of the stigma," said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. "The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'"</p>

<h2>Harder path for college grads</h2><p>For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong — it's just behind the times. </p><p> "The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable," said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.</p><p>But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops $38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative. </p><p>Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found. </p>

<p>More recently, economists also point to a <span class="link">jump in unemployment</span> for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019. </p><p>Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. </p><h2>"AI can't go out in the field"</h2><p>Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services — solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business. </p><p>While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.</p><p>"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is," Curcie told CBS News. </p><p>Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.</p><p>Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.</p>

<p>"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench," he said.</p><p>Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase — no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security. </p><p>"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens," Palmer said. </p>
<p>Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company. </p><p>"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over," he said. "AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine."</p>

<p>Millions of Medicaid enrollees may have a way out of the new federal <span class="link">work requirement</span> — if they live in a county with high unemployment.</p><p>By January 2027, President Trump's far-reaching domestic policy law will require many adult, nondisabled Medicaid enrollees in 42 states and Washington, D.C., to work or volunteer 80 hours a month or go to school.</p><p>But under the law, Medicaid enrollees in counties where unemployment is at least 8% or 1.5 times the national unemployment rate could be shielded from the work requirement, if their state applies for an exemption.</p><p>A new analysis by KFF shows that exemption in the GOP's work requirement could offer a reprieve to potentially millions of Americans caught in a tough spot — needing to work to secure health insurance but having trouble finding a job.</p><p>The Congressional Budget Office projected the work requirement would apply to 18.5 million Medicaid enrollees, causing about 5.3 million to lose their government health coverage by 2034. CBO spokesperson Caitlin Emma confirmed to KFF Health News that analysts factored the unemployment rate exemption into their projections. Only states that expanded Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act or a special waiver must enact a work requirement, under the federal law.</p>

<p>But how many people could be exempt depends on how the Trump administration interprets the law, in addition to whether their states' officials apply.</p><p>For example, if Trump officials exempt people in counties where the unemployment rate has been above the law's thresholds for any month over a 12-month period, about 4.6 million Medicaid enrollees in 386 counties could qualify for an exemption today based on the latest unemployment data, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.</p><p>That amounts to just under a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees subject to the work requirement.</p><p>Under that one-month threshold, "the impact could be fairly significant," said Jennifer Tolbert, a co-author of the analysis and the deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.</p>

<p>But, she said, the Trump administration is more likely to adopt a stricter threshold based on average unemployment over a 12-month period. That would align with work requirements under the federal <span class="link">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</span>, the food assistance commonly known as food stamps.</p><p>Only about 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees living in 158 counties could be exempted under that standard, or about 7% of the total subject to work requirements, KFF found. That's about 7% of enrollees who live in expansion states who would otherwise need to meet the new requirement.</p><p>Based on the 12-month criteria, about 90% of Medicaid enrollees who could be exempted based on high unemployment reside in five states, according to KFF: California, New York, Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio. California alone accounts for over half of those who could be exempted.</p><p>The unemployment rate exemption is one of several carve-outs from the <span class="link">Medicaid work requirement</span> in the GOP's law. The law also exempts parents with children under 14, people who are disabled or frail, and those who are pregnant, incarcerated, or in a substance use disorder program, among others. The high unemployment provision is different than most because it exempts people living in entire counties.</p><p>Two top Republicans key to the bill's passage — House Speaker Mike Johnson and Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee — did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>To qualify for the Medicaid exemption, states would have to apply to the federal government on behalf of individuals in eligible counties. And if a county earned an exemption, the government would determine how long it applies.</p><p>Even if the federal government grants exemptions broadly, health advocates fear some Republican-led states could balk at applying for exemptions in order to keep enrollment down, as they say has been the case with SNAP exemptions. As of 2023, 18 states did not have an exemption under the SNAP program, even though some of their residents might be eligible.</p>

<p>"It's not a guarantee that people can rely on," said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group that intends to push for the broadest possible exemptions to help people maintain their coverage. Eastern Kentucky has several counties with perennially high unemployment.</p><p>In advocating for <span class="link">Mr. Trump's bill</span>, many Republicans in Washington argued that most people who gained Medicaid benefits under the Affordable Care Act should be working to get off of government assistance.</p><p>But as Georgia's and Arkansas' experiences have shown, Medicaid work requirements can be costly for states to run and frustrating for enrollees to navigate. About 18,000 people in Arkansas, or nearly a quarter of the state's adults who gained Medicaid coverage through the ACA expansion, lost coverage when the state had a work requirement in 2018 and 2019. A court ended the state's work requirement program.</p><p>Critics point out that most Medicaid enrollees already work or have a disability or caregiving responsibilities, and they argue the reporting requirements merely serve as a bureaucratic hurdle to obtaining and keeping coverage. Under the GOP law, enrollees' work status needs to be verified at least twice a year.</p><p>Most of the coverage losses due to work requirements occur among people who work or should qualify for an exemption but nevertheless lose coverage due to red tape, research shows.</p><p>Not every state must implement a work requirement under Mr. Trump's law, only those that chose to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income people through the ACA or a federal waiver. The ACA has provided hundreds of billions in federal dollars to help states cover everyone making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — $21,597 for an individual in 2025.</p><p>Forty states and Washington, D.C., took up the expansion. Georgia and Wisconsin partly expanded their Medicaid eligibility by getting a federal waiver, adding them to the list of states subject to the work requirement. These two states were not included in the KFF analysis because of a lack of county-level enrollment data.</p>

<p>Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said she is pleased the law makes some exceptions for places where jobs are scarce. It could limit how many people lose coverage because of the work requirement, she said.</p><p>Wagner said SNAP's unemployment rate exemption has helped millions of people avoid losing their food assistance, but its impact also depends on whether a state seeks the waiver.</p><p>She is concerned the Trump administration may make it difficult for counties to get exempted under the Medicaid law.</p><p>"I'm glad it's in there as it will certainly help people, but it's still a terrible bill," she said. "This will not really blunt the harm of the bill."</p><p><em>KFF Health News</em><em> is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at </em><em>KFF</em><em> — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.</em></p>

<section class="content__body">
<p>About 58 million pounds of corn dogs and other sausage-on-a-stick products are being recalled across the U.S. because pieces of wood may be embedded in the batter, with several consumers reporting injuries to date. </p><p>According to a Saturday notice published by the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, the recall covers select "State Fair Corn Dogs on a Stick" and "Jimmy Dean Pancakes &amp; Sausage on a Stick" products from Texas-based Hillshire Brands, which is a subsidiary of Tyson Foods. </p><p>The contamination problem was discovered after Hillshire received multiple consumer complaints, the service notes, five of which involved injuries. The company later determined that a "limited number" of these products included "extraneous pieces of wooden stick within the batter," Tyson said in a corresponding announcement - adding that it opted to initiate a recall "out of an abundance of caution."</p>
<p>The recalled corn dogs and sausage-on-a-stick goods were produced between March 17 and as recently Friday, per Saturday's recall notices. Tyson, which is headquartered in Arkansas, says the issue was isolated to one facility located in Haltom City, Texas. </p><p>FSIS is worried that some of these recalled products may be in consumers' refrigerators and freezers in households across the U.S. - as well as some schools and other institutions. In addition to being sold online and to retailers nationwide, the agency noted Saturday, these products were also sold to school districts and Defense Department facilities.</p>
<p>Consumers in possession of the now recalled "State Fair Corn Dogs on a Stick" and "Jimmy Dean Pancakes &amp; Sausage on a Stick" are urged to throw them away or return them to their place of purchase.  </p>

<p>To determine which corn dogs and other sausage goods are subject to this recall, consumers should check the product's name, use by dates and other identifying information published online by the FSIS and Tyson. The products being recalled should also have an establishment number of "EST-582" or "P-894" printed on the packaging. </p><p>It's unclear if consumers who purchased these now-recalled products will be eligible for a refund. The FSIS says consumers with questions about the recall can contact Christina Self, The Hillshire Brands Company Associate Director of Customer Care, at 888-747-7611.     </p><p>Foreign object contamination is one of the top reasons for food recalls in the U.S. Beyond plastic, metal fragments, bits of bugs and more "extraneous" materials have prompted recalls by making their way into packaged goods.</p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>At least three people are confirmed dead after heavy rain caused flooding in Arizona, and hundreds of propane tanks have created a hazardous situation in a rural community devastated by the floods.</p><p>Two people died and at least one person was missing after rain inundated Globe, a city of about 7,250 people about 88 miles east of Phoenix, Mayor  Al Gameros told CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV. Officials initially said three people were dead, but that was updated on Sunday.</p><p>Another person was found dead Saturday morning near a vehicle caught in floodwaters in suburban Phoenix the night before. The vehicle appeared to be empty after it was spotted partially submerged in about 8 feet of fast-moving water on Friday evening in a greenbelt park area, the Scottsdale Fire Department said. After the water dropped a bit overnight, crews found the body of a person pinned underneath a walkway bridge, the department said.</p>
<p>In the rural community of Globe, one of Arizona's oldest mining towns, sheriff deputies were looking into reports of more people who may be missing, said Carl Melford, emergency manager in Gila County, but he couldn't specify a number.</p><p>"We now have a massive search and rescue underway," he said.</p><p>According to the National Weather Service in Phoenix, the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport on Friday saw the highest one-day rainfall total in nearly seven years. It was also the city's fourth wettest day in recorded history since 2000.</p>

<p>Rain poured down and quickly flooded the downtown area Friday, Melford said. One of the first areas hit was a propane tank distributor, sending about 1,000 residential-sized tanks throughout the community, he said.</p><p>"There's propane tanks everywhere through downtown Globe," he said, adding that hazmat workers have been sent to the scene. "Luckily none of them ignited or exploded."</p><p>The area previously experienced flooding in 2021 after a wildfire, but it didn't happen like this, Melford said.</p><p>"This was an extremely heavy amount of rain in an extremely short period of time," he said.</p>

<p>Authorities are asking residents to not go out searching in the floodwaters because search and rescue officials are accompanied by dogs who might pick up the scent of aspiring volunteers instead of possible flood victims. If people want to help, they should start by assisting friends and neighbors in need, Melford said.</p><p>Globe city council members declared an emergency, saying they have never seen anything like the flooding.</p><p>Scores of people have stepped up to volunteer, Gameros said, adding that many buildings in the community's downtown have been damaged. Officials asked people to stay away from the area until they could ensure it is safe to go in there.</p><p>"Our primary, again, is search and rescue," Gameros said Saturday.</p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams is dropping his bid for reelection, setting up a three-way race between Queens Assemblyman and Democrat <span class="link">frontrunner Zohran Mamdani</span>, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent, and Guardian Angels founder and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa to lead America's largest city.  </p><p>Adams, who took office in January 2022, announced he was dropping out of the mayor's race in a video posted to his social media Sunday afternoon.</p><p>"Despite all we've achieved, I cannot continue my reelection campaign. The constant media speculation about my future and the Campaign Finance Board's decision to withhold millions of dollars have undermined my ability to raise the funds needed for a serious campaign," <span class="link">the city's 110th mayor said</span>. </p><p>There has been intense questioning about the future of Adams' campaign over the past few months. Most polls <span class="link">showed him with single-digit support</span>, well behind Mamdani, the Democratic nominee; Cuomo, an independent; and Sliwa, the Republican candidate.</p><p>The mayor previously blasted speculation that he would drop his reelection bid. <span class="link">In a Sept. 5 news conference</span>, he said he was "the only one that can beat [Zohran] Mamdani," <span class="link">insisted he was remaining in the race</span>, and referred to the Democratic frontrunner and former governor as "two spoiled brats."   </p>

<p>It has been <span class="link">a tumultuous year overall for Adams</span>. He has faced a <span class="link">federal corruption scandal</span> and criticism over <span class="link">his relationship with the Trump administration</span>.</p><p>"I was wrongfully charged because I fought for this city, and if I had to do it again, I would fight for New York again," he said in his video message. </p><h2>Mamdani reacts to Adams suspending campaign</h2><p>Adams' name will <span class="link">still appear on the general election ballot</span> in November, even though he suspended his campaign. He was running as an independent after sitting out the Democratic primary. </p><p>Mamdani, who <span class="link">defeated Cuomo</span> in the primary, spoke to CBS News New York's Lisa Rozner on Sunday evening, and initially repeated part of his earlier statement on Adams' departure from the race.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump and his billionaire donors can determine Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo's actions but they will not dictate the results of this race," Mamdani said, adding, "And what we have seen today is a reflection of the fact that New Yorkers know that Andrew Cuomo's agenda is Eric Adams' record. That's what he is running on. That's what we are going to feed on on Nov. 4."</p><p>Rozner asked Mamdani why he linked a call to President Trump and corruption in his earlier statement.</p><p>"Well, I think we have just seen time and time again Donald Trump speaking openly about the fact that he wants to change the contours of this race to stop our campaign," Mamdani said. "And he wants to do so because he is afraid of the fact that, unlike him, we won't just diagnose the issue of a cost-of-living crisis; we'll deliver on it, and actually make this a city that New Yorkers can afford, in stark contrast of what he has done since leading this country, which is throwing New Yorkers off of their health insurance, off of their SNAP benefits, make it even harder for them to afford this city."</p><p>Cuomo tried later Sunday to make it seem like it's a two-person race between him and Mamdani.</p><p>"If Mr. Mamdani were to succeed, New York would not be New York," Cuomo said. "The intolerance that Mr. Mamdani represents, the judgmentalism, the division that he causes among the people in New York, the city would be splintered."</p><p>Asked about the two-person race idea that Cuomo keeps pushing, Mamdani said, "Look, I can tell you that Andrew Cuomo wanted me to be his opponent in the primary and we beat him by 13 points. And so, I continue to be confident in our chances on Nov. 4 to actually deliver a city that puts working people first, and not one that has been led into this crisis by people just like Andrew Cuomo."</p><p>Sliwa said he's confident in his chances and doesn't buy into the notion that the race is now all about Cuomo and Mamdani.</p>

<p>"[It's] about time," the Republican said of Adams' exit from the race. "This soap opera has continued too long. So the price was right for Eric Adams. So he's on to something else. That clears the field. It's Zohran Mamdani versus Curtis Sliwa. Cuomo had a shot, he lost. So clear the field. It's law and order Curtis Sliwa. Turn [loose] the criminals Zohran Mamdani. Thirty-seven days to go. Let's get it on."</p><h2>Cuomo thanks Adams for his leadership</h2><p>Cuomo said in an earlier statement Adams' decision "was not an easy one," adding, "but I believe he is sincere in putting the well-being of New York City ahead of personal ambition. We face destructive extremist forces that would devastate our city through incompetence or ignorance, but it is not too late to stop them."</p><p>The former governor also credited Adams for fighting the good fight for as long as he has in the city, from his childhood up through his public service.</p>
<p>"Mayor Adams has much to be proud of in his accomplishments. Only in New York can a child raised in a tenement in Bushwick, who once worked as a squeegee boy and a mailroom clerk, rise to become mayor. Whatever differences we may have, Eric Adams' story is undeniably one of resilience, a testament to the spirit of this city," Cuomo said.</p><h2>New York leaders tout some of Adams' accomplishments</h2><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul released a <span class="link">statement </span>saying she was proud to work with Adams since he took office. </p><p>"During that time we have delivered much needed housing for New Yorkers, including the passage of the mayor's visionary City of Yes plan. We have connected more New Yorkers to mental health services and supportive housing. We've driven down crime in our subways and gotten illegal guns off the streets. I have been grateful for his partnership. He leaves New York City better than he inherited it and that will always be central to his legacy as mayor."</p><p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who represents the 8th Congressional District in Brooklyn, released a statement that said, in part, "Eric Adams has served courageously and authentically for decades as a member of the NYPD, the New York State Senate, in Brooklyn Borough Hall and as our 110th mayor. During his time in office, violent crime is down, the building of affordable housing units is up and New York City has recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>"As is the case in any major city, there are challenges that remain, particularly as it relates to lowering the high cost of living. Yet, it is clear that meaningful progress has been made in several important areas during the term of Mayor Adams. Thank you for your service to our city," Jeffries added.</p><p>The Rev. Al Sharpton said in a statement that Adams told him about his decision before releasing the video on Sunday. </p><p>"I told him I respected his decision," Sharpton said. "We have been friends for nearly 35 years, and he helped us establish National Action Network in 1991. He has been a friend of NAN year in and year out since, especially over the last almost four years he led City Hall. NAN remains focused on continuing our work of making New York City safe, livable, and prosperous for Black and Brown communities."  </p><h2>White House floated new job for NYC Mayor Adams</h2><p>Prior to the mayor dropping out, sources told CBS News New York that the White House was <span class="link">looking into possible government positions</span> to persuade him to exit the race.</p><p>Sources told CBS News New York's political reporter Marcia Kramer that during a trip to Florida, Adams met with Steve Witkoff, a New York real estate investor and close advisor to the president.</p><p>"While I will always listen if called to serve our country, no formal offers have been made. I am still running for reelection, and my full focus is on the safety and quality of life of every New Yorker," Adams said in early September, as speculation about his potential departure swirled. </p><p>The mayor called the reports just rumors. </p>
<p>"To say, would you take a job in the administration or would I take it somewhere else, that's hypothetical," Adams said on Sept. 3. "I'm running for office and I'm going to finish doing that. I got work to do."</p>

<p>President Trump said he wanted to see a one-on-one race against Mamdani, adding <span class="link">two of the candidates should leave the race</span> to make that happen, in hopes of uniting independent and Republican voters against the Democratic socialist. </p><p>Both Adams and Sliwa <span class="link">previously dismissed the suggestion</span> and vowed to stay in the running. Cuomo had said <span class="link">he would drop out if he wasn't leading in the polls</span> among the potential challengers to Mamdani heading into Election Day. Independent candidate <span class="link">Jim Walden already left the race</span>, although <span class="link">a court decided his name will remain on the final ballot</span> despite his dropping out. </p><p>Mamdani responded to what he called Mr. Trump's "meddling" in the race, calling it "an affront to our democracy." He later challenged the president to face him in a debate, saying, "Let's cut out the middleman."</p><h2>Trump administration squashed Adams' corruption case</h2><p>It was not the first time Mr. Trump put presidential pressure on New York City politics. Upon taking office earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Justice directed federal prosecutors in New York to <span class="link">dismiss their federal bribery case against Adams</span>.</p><p>The directive led acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York <span class="link">Danielle Sassoon to resign</span>, along with <span class="link">other members of her office</span>. </p><p>The charges were <span class="link">ultimately dropped with prejudice</span>, meaning they <span class="link">cannot be filed again in the future</span>. </p><p>Adams' political opponents <span class="link">repeatedly called on him to resign</span>, claiming he would be under the president's influence. The mayor remained defiant, <span class="link">insisting there was no quid-pro-quo</span> and <span class="link">launching his reelection campaign</span>. </p>

<h2>Adams administration dogged by corruption allegations</h2><p>Adams was accused of <span class="link">soliciting illegal campaign donations from wealthy and corporate donors</span> and using them to tap into matching election funds in the 2021 race. </p><p>As part of the investigation, he was accused of accepting lavish bribes, like flight upgrades and luxury hotel rooms, in exchange for his political influence once he got into office. He <span class="link">pleaded not guilty</span> and denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>The FBI <span class="link">raided several members of Adams' inner circle</span> last fall, leading to <span class="link">a flurry of resignations</span>. More of his administration <span class="link">stepped down this February</span>, and his <span class="link">longtime adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin</span> was <span class="link">indicted on new bribery charges</span> as recently as this August. </p><p>His former campaign fundraiser, <span class="link">Winnie Greco</span>, was also recently accused of <span class="link">handing a journalist an envelope of cash</span> inside a bag of potato chips. The mayor <span class="link">denied involvement with either incident</span>. </p><p><em>This is a developing story. Please stay with CBS News New York for updates. </em></p>

<p>Police in Grand Blanc, Michigan, say the gunman who <span class="link">killed at least four people and injured eight others at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</span> on Sunday morning died after "exchanging gunfire" with police.</p><p>The suspect was identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said. </p><p>Sanford served in the U.S. Marines for three-and-a-half years from 2004 to 2008, CBS News has confirmed. He was deployed from August 2007 to March 2008 as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, which <span class="link">led to the fall of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein</span>.</p><p>According to Renye, calls about the shooting at the Church of Latter-day Saints on McCandlish Road came in around 10:25 a.m., and officers were at the scene less than a minute later. Police said Sanford died at the parking lot of the church around 10:33 a.m.</p><p>Sanford lived around eight miles away from the church. Michigan State Police and a bomb squad were investigating his home throughout the evening on Sunday. </p>

<p>Investigators say there may be bomb making materials inside, though it's unknown if anything was found. </p><p>Nearby residents told CBS News Detroit they couldn't believe what happened in their small suburban community located about an hour northwest of Detroit.</p><p>"I really feel for the families, you know, even feel for the accused," resident April Vann said. "It's just a sad, really sad situation. You know, family's lives are destroyed in 2.2 seconds."</p><p>Jason Miller, another nearby resident, said something has to change. </p>

<p>"It's troubling. A mile from home, you know? It's obviously getting closer to us, right?" Miller said. "So when it starts getting close, you're not just looking at the TV screen saying, 'I feel bad. What's going on?' It's here now, and that's why we got to do something. It's getting to be a problem."</p><p>Several neighbors weren't able to get inside their homes on Sunday afternoon. Michigan State Police troopers said they would be in the area into the evening.</p><p><span class="link">President Trump said</span> on Truth Social that Sunday's shooting was "horrendous," and that he would provide "full support" to state and local officials for the investigation.</p>

<p>At least four people are dead after a shooter opened fire at a church in Michigan during a Sunday morning worship service and then set it ablaze. Eight other victims have been hospitalized, according to police.</p><p>Worshippers were gathered at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on McCandlish Road in Grand Blanc Township around 10:25 a.m., Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said. That's when the suspect, identified as a 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan, drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church, exited his vehicle and fired "several rounds" of an assault rifle at hundreds of churchgoers, Renye said at a news conference.</p><p>Ten people with gunshot wounds were taken to the hospital, where two victims were pronounced dead. One victim was in critical condition and seven others were in stable condition on Sunday afternoon. </p><p>Renye said in an update on Sunday evening that two other people were found dead inside the church and that "some" individuals are still unaccounted for, though the exact number is unknown. Police did not say how those two people died.</p><p>Police said Sanford died after a Grand Blanc officer and a DNR officer "engaged in gunfire" with him in the back parking lot of the church. Records confirmed by CBS News show that Sanford was a Marine Corps veteran. Authorities have not confirmed his motive in the attack.</p>
<p>According to investigators, the suspect deliberately started a fire at the Latter-day Saints church at some point. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said the fire was started using some type of accelerant. Crews have since contained the blaze, but the church is considered a total loss.</p>

<p>The FBI is leading the case, which is now being investigated as "an act of targeted violence." </p><p>Michigan state police said Sunday evening that officers are continuing to response to other locations in the community after they received additional bomb threats. Law enforcement confirmed some suspected devices were located but did not provide additional details of where or what they were.</p><p>Officials have set up an on-site reunification site at a movie theatre on Trillium Circle Avenue. Anyone who needs to connect with someone who was at the church is asked to call the American Red Cross at 248-705-7352.</p><p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation is asking anyone with information to call 1-800-225-5324 or submit a tip here.</p>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ said in a written statement that it has been in communication with law enforcement and that it's thankful for the emergency responders who are helping the victims and their families.</p>

<p>"We are deeply grateful for the outpouring of prayers and concern from so many people around the world," the statement said. "In moments of sorrow and uncertainty, we find strength and comfort through our faith in Jesus Christ. Places of worship are meant to be sanctuaries of peacemaking, prayer and connection. We pray for peace and healing for all involved."</p><h2>Officials react to Michigan church shooting</h2><p>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer posted a written statement on social media that said, "My heart is breaking for the Grand Blanc community. Violence anywhere, especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable. I am grateful to the first responders who took action quickly. We will continue to monitor this situation and hold the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc close."</p><p>Grand Blanc Township police said at least 100 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents are responding to the shooting. FBI Director Kash Patel said on X that the agency is tracking reports of the shooting and that agents are at the scene to assist local authorities.</p><p>"Violence in a place of worship is a cowardly and criminal act. Our prayers are with the victims and their families during this terrible tragedy," Patel said.</p><p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she has received briefings about the incident.</p><p>"Such violence at a place of worship is heartbreaking and chilling. Please join me in praying for the victims of this terrible tragedy," Bondi said.</p><p>President Trump also said that he has been briefed on the shooting.</p>

<p>"The suspect is dead, but there is still a lot to learn. This appears to be yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States of America. The Trump Administration will keep the Public posted, as we always do. In the meantime, PRAY for the victims, and their families. THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY MUST END, IMMEDIATELY," Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post.</p><p>According to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, her agency is in communication with "interagency partners."</p><p>Noem added in a social media post on X that, "Sacred places of worship should never fear violence in America. I am praying for the victims of this heinous attack and their families."</p><p>The New York Police Department said early Sunday afternoon that it was deploying "additional resources to religious institutions across the city," in response to the shooting. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass also said Sunday that out of an abundance of caution, the Los Angeles Police Department will be increasing patrols at places of worship across the city. </p><p>The Grand Blanc Township Police Department said it will have counselors at its facility starting on Monday and through the rest of the week.</p>

<p>Bad Bunny will bring his Latin trap and reggaeton swagger to the NFL's biggest stage next year: The Grammy winner will headline the Apple Music <span class="link">Super Bowl</span> halftime show in Northern California.</p><p>The NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Sunday that Bad Bunny will lead the halftime festivities from Levi's Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California.</p><p>The Puerto Rican superstar's selection comes amid another career-defining run: He's fresh off a <span class="link">historic Puerto Rico residency</span> this month that drew more than half a million fans and is leading all nominees at the Latin Grammys in November. He has become one of the world's most streamed artists with albums such as "Un Verano Sin Ti," an all-Spanish-language LP.</p>
<p>"What I'm feeling goes beyond myself," Bad Bunny said in a statement. "It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL."</p><p>In a short video posted by the NFL on Sunday, the 31-year-old artist is sporting a pava, a Puerto Rican straw hat, which is a nod to Puerto Rican mid-century farmers. It shows Bad Bunny sitting on a goalpost to the tune of "Debi Tirar Más Fotos." The song speaks to the reality that Puerto Ricans must leave the homeland if they are to thrive. It is a song that immigrants of all origins have embraced as an anthem.</p><p>The Super Bowl halftime show announcement comes on the heel of the superstar's final residency show at San Juan's El Choli. It was livestreamed on Prime Video and Twitch, breaking viewership records for a single-artist performance, according to Amazon Music. </p>

<p>Bad Bunny's historic shows have vitalized Puerto Rico's economy, while celebrating the island's pride, culture, and resilience on the anniversary of <span class="link">Hurricane Maria</span>.</p><p>Roc Nation founder Jay-Z said in a statement that what Bad Bunny has "done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world's biggest stage."</p><p>The 31-year-old artist born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio has won three Grammys and 12 Latin Grammys. He has become a global ambassador for Latin music, starred in films such as "Bullet Train," "Caught Stealing" and "Happy Gilmore 2," and collaborated with top fashion houses. He'll enter the Latin Grammys as the leading nominee with 12, dethroning producer and songwriter Édgar Barrera.</p><p>Roc Nation and Emmy-winning producer Jesse Collins will serve as co-executive producers of the halftime show. Hamish Hamilton will serve as director.</p>

<p>Last year, <span class="link">Kendrick Lamar</span> shined with guest SZA in New Orleans, setting the record for the <span class="link">most-watched Super Bowl halftime</span> show with 133.5 million viewers. His performance surpassed the audience for Michael Jackson's 1993 show.</p>

<p>The Village of Broadview said they've launched a criminal investigation after a CBS News Chicago reporter had a projectile fired at her vehicle by an ICE agent late Sunday morning.</p><p>Reporter Asal Rezaei said there was no active protest or protesters at the facility, and she was alone with no one around her at the time of the incident.</p><p>In a report filed with Broadview police, Rezaei said she was driving her truck with her driver's side window down, while approaching the 25th Avenue entrance to see if any activity was taking place, before leaving the area. </p><p>That's when she said a masked ICE agent, who saw her window down, shot a pepper ball about 50 feet from the inside of the fence, hitting her truck's driver's side panel, causing the chemical agents to engulf the inside of her truck.</p>

<p>Rezaei said the pepper ball left white powder on her windshield, and her face had "been on fire for at least the last 10 minutes or so." The chemical also caused her to vomit once outside of her truck, she said.</p>

<p>In her report, she said, "At this moment it's not really clear why that officer took a shot at me. My car has been here several times, although I did not identify myself verbally as a member of the press. There were no protests going on," said Rezaei. "There was actually nobody there except one other person that was a member of a fire department that was there checking in on the buildings around this area."</p><p>Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills responded to the incident in a statement, saying, "The Village of Broadview Police Department has launched a criminal investigation into an allegedly unprovoked attack on a CBS Chicago TV news reporter's vehicle by a chemical munition fired from the direction of U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement detention facility. The victim declined medical attention. The Broadview Police Department expects the full cooperation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security into our criminal investigation."</p><p>CBS News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security but has yet to hear back. </p>

<p>Hurricane Humberto rapidly strengthened over the weekend, reaching <span class="link">Category 5</span> strength on Saturday before fluctuating back down to a still-powerful Category 4 on Sunday. </p><p>A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm could bring life-threatening surf and rip currents to the area and portions of the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.</p><p>The storm is <span class="link">one of two systems</span> swirling over the western Atlantic that could potentially bring some downstream impacts to parts of the Southeast U.S. coast, from Florida to North Carolina, the director of the Miami-based hurricane center, Michael Brennan, said. The second system strengthened to <span class="link">become Tropical Storm Imelda</span> on Sunday, and is expected to dump heavy rain from the Florida coast up to the Carolinas.</p><h2>Hurricane Humberto forecast and path</h2><p>As of late Sunday night, Humberto was located about 430 miles south of Bermuda. It was moving northwest at about 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, with higher gusts, according to the NHC. </p>
<p>The storm is likely to remain a major hurricane for the next several days, forecasters said. A storm is deemed a "major" hurricane if it's a Category 3, 4 or 5 due to the potential for "significant loss of life and damage," the center says.</p>

<p>"Fluctuations in intensity are possible during the next day or so. Gradual weakening is expected after that, but Humberto is expected to remain a dangerous major hurricane for the next couple of days," the hurricane center said in an advisory Sunday.</p><p>Those along the U.S. East Coast could begin to see the effects of Humberto beginning Monday, with swells generated by the storm likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.</p><p>Humberto is the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. It comes on the heels of <span class="link">Hurricane Gabrielle</span>, which is not impacting land as it heads farther out into the Atlantic.</p>
<h2>Forecasters also tracking Imelda</h2><p>The hurricane center is also closely monitoring a second storm system over the northeast Caribbean in the Atlantic, which strengthened into <span class="link">Tropical Storm Imelda</span> on Sunday and is expected to become a hurricane Monday or Tuesday.</p>

<p>Imelda was expected to bring "significant rainfall" to portions of Cuba and the Bahamas, both of which could see up to 8 inches of rain, the hurricane center said. It will also likely produce flash and urban flooding, with the possibility of mudslides in higher terrain across eastern Cuba.</p><p>Tropical storm conditions are possible in areas along the east coast of Florida on Monday, and heavy rainfall is expected into Wednesday morning across coastal areas of the Carolinas, the forecasters said.</p>
<p>There is also a possibility it <span class="link">could interact with Humberto</span> — a phenomenon known as <span class="link">the Fujiwhara effect</span>, in which two different storms converge and either join or spin around each other. But CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said such an outcome is not considered likely in this case.</p>

<p>Tropical Storm Imelda formed Sunday in the western Atlantic and is forecast to strengthen over the next few days, bringing the threat of torrential rainfall to portions of the southeastern U.S. early this week, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center.</p><p>Imelda, the ninth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is forecast to become a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.</p><h2>Tropical Storm Imelda forecast maps</h2><p>As of 11 p.m. ET on Sunday, Imelda was bringing tropical storm conditions and heavy rains to the central and northwestern Bahamas, according to the NHC. The storm was located about 125 miles northwest of the Central Bahamas, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph.</p><p>Forecasters said the storm was expected to strengthen through Tuesday. Imelda was moving north at about 9 mph, according to the NHC. Rainfall from Imelda is likely to impact Cuba and the Bahamas through Tuesday.</p><p>The risk of significant wind impacts along the southeastern U.S. was decreasing on Sunday evening, though swells and high surf from both Imelda and <span class="link">Humberto</span> are expected to cause dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along the east coast of Florida and Georgia through Monday.</p>
<p>Imelda's center was expected to cross over the central and northwestern Bahamas Sunday before making its approach to the U.S. coastline. The Bahamas and Cuba are already receiving heavy rains from the system. </p>

<p>"Steady strengthening is forecast during the next several days," the hurricane center said.</p>
<p>Imelda is forecast to bring up to 8 inches of rain to Cuba and the Bahamas, with the possibility of flash and urban flooding and mudslides.</p><p>Then the area stretching from Florida's Atlantic coast north to the Carolinas could see heavy rain, the hurricane center said. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with up to 6 inches in some local areas, were forecast through Tuesday across parts of the coastal Carolinas.</p><h2>Tropical storm warnings and watches for Imelda</h2><p>A tropical storm warning was in place Sunday for the Central Bahamas, including Cat Island, the Exumas, Long Island, Rum Cay and San Salvador; and portions of the northwestern Bahamas, including Eleuthera, New Providence, the Abacos, Berry Islands, Andros Island and Grand Bahama Island.</p>

<p>A tropical storm watch that had been issued for part of Florida's east coast, from the Palm Beach-Martin County line to the Flagler-Volusia County line, was canceled Sunday afternoon.</p><p>The hurricane center warned "minor coastal flooding is possible" in some areas, with 1 to 2 feet possible from the Volusia/Brevard County Line in Florida up to the South Santee River in South Carolina if the surge hits during high tide.</p><h2>Imelda follows Hurricane Humberto</h2><p>Imelda comes on the heels of <span class="link">Hurricane Humberto</span>, which rapidly intensified to a major hurricane over the Atlantic on Saturday but is not expected to reach land. Humberto reached as high as a Category 5 on Saturday before fluctuating back down to strong Category 4.</p>
<p>Forecasters said last week there was a small possibility the two systems could interact, creating what is <span class="link">known as a Fujiwhara effect</span>, a rare phenomenon in which two different storms merge and become entangled around a newly formed, common center. However, they said it was not considered a likely outcome in this case.</p><h2>U.S. officials brace for Imelda</h2><p>South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster issued a state of emergency ahead of Imelda on Friday, writing that "while the storm's arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the ENTIRE state of South Carolina."</p><p>On Saturday, McMaster wrote on social media that the forecast had "improved" but that Imelda "still poses a significant threat to our entire state."</p><p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Friday it is also preparing for Imelda's potential impact. While the FEMA National Response Coordination Center has not yet been activated, FEMA is planning the potential requirements for staging bases in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic that would be stocked with meals, water and generators if needed.</p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the president said <span class="link">he will send troops to Portland</span>, state Attorney General Dan Rayfield announced Sunday.</p><p>It comes after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sent a memo to Gov. Tina Kotek authorizing 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to the city of Portland, Rayfield said in a news release. The troops are to be deployed for 60 days to protect federal property "where protests are occurring or likely to occur," he said.</p><p>The lawsuit argued that President Trump lacks authority to federalize the National Guard. <span class="link">California filed a similar lawsuit in June</span> after the administration sent troops to Los Angeles.</p><p>"Oregon communities are stable, and our local officials have been clear: we have the capacity to manage public safety without federal interference," Rayfield in a statement. </p><p>"Sending in 200 National Guard troops to guard a single building is not normal. If you had a concern about safety at your own home, you'd make a few calls and fill the gaps — not call in an army. What we're seeing is not about public safety, it's about the President flexing political muscle under the guise of law and order, chasing a media hit at the expense of our community."</p>

<p>Mr. Trump posted on social media on Saturday that he had directed Hegseth to send "all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any other ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists."</p><p>In response to the lawsuit, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CBS News Mr. Trump "is using his lawful authority" to send troops to Portland, saying that troops are being sent to protect federal assets and personnel "following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters."</p><p>Local officials, including Gov. Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, have pushed back on Mr. Trump's comments and plans to send troops to the city.</p><p>"When the president and I spoke yesterday, I told him in very plain language that there is no insurrection or a threat to public safety that necessitates military intervention in Portland or any other city in our state, despite this, and with all evidence to the contrary, he has chosen to disregard Oregonian safety and ability to govern themselves," Kotek said at a virtual news conference on Sunday. </p>

<p>She said that there have been some demonstrations near a federal facility, but Portland police and federal officials there are capable of handling the situation.</p><p>"And when people cross the line ... there's unlawful activity, people are being held accountable," Kotek said.</p><p>In a statement to CBS News, a Portland Police spokesperson said there have been "an almost constant protest down at the ICE facility in South Portland," but did not comment on any arrests.</p><p>"The protest numbers have waxed and waned over time. Last night there were some people down there, and there are more tonight," the spokesperson said.</p><p>The governor called the deployment of troops unlawful and said that it will make residents less safe. </p><p>Kotek also said she has been in conversations with <span class="link">California Gov. Gavin Newsom</span> and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who's also dealing with the <span class="link">presence of federal agents in Chicago</span>.</p><p>"We are all concerned across our country that this is a abuse of power and we are all trying to figure this out together," Kotek said.</p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The <span class="link">shooter who attacked</span> the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement <span class="link">facility in Dallas</span> was targeting ICE agents, federal officials said at a news conference Thursday.</p><p>Nancy Larson, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said a collection of notes found at <span class="link">Joshua Jahn's</span> residence showed an animus toward ICE agents and that he had been planning the attack for some time. Jahn legally purchased the 8mm bolt-action rifle used in the shooting last month, officials said.</p><p>Larson said that early Wednesday morning, Jahn was seen driving his car with a long ladder. Officials believe he used the ladder to access the roof of an office building near the Dallas ICE facility, from where he started firing at about 6:30 a.m. </p><p>Larson said he fired rounds the length of the building and intended to damage property, as well as hurt or kill ICE personnel.</p><p>The three victims were detainees inside one of the vans Jahn targeted, Larson said. One of them died, and the others are in critical condition. Officials did not provide any more specifics about the victims' identities.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Sept. 27, the man fatally shot was identified as 37-year-old Norlan Guzman-Fuentes by the Dallas Medical Examiner.  The two injured men have been identified by ICE as Jose Andres Bordones-Molina and Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez.</p><p>Larson said law enforcement personnel from multiple federal agencies put themselves at risk to move other detainees who were in the vans to safety.</p><p>The Dallas ICE office will remain closed on Monday, September 29, ICE said.</p><h2>Dallas ICE shooting suspect worked alone, authorities say</h2><p>Another note found at the suspect's residence said, "Yes, it was just me," Larson said.</p>

<p>She and Joseph Rothrock, the FBI special agent in charge of the Dallas field office, both said all of the evidence indicates that Jahn acted alone. Larson also said there was no indication that Jahn was a member of any group.</p><p>Rothrock said it was officers from the Dallas Police Department and Dallas County Sheriff's Office who found Jahn on the rooftop. He was dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p><h2>Gunman used apps that track ICE agents</h2><p>Marcos Charles, the ICE executive associate director for enforcement and removal operations, blamed "wild rhetoric" for what he said was a 1,000% increase in assaults on ICE officers.</p><p>Charles also said that Jahn used apps that track ICE agents as part of his planning for the attack. </p><p>"Anyone who creates or distributes these apps that is designed to spot, track and locate ICE officers, are well aware of the dangers they are exposing to law enforcement," Charles said.</p><p>Multiple <span class="link">apps have sprung up</span> in recent months to warn migrants of potential ICE operations and help them avoid arrest as the Trump administration increased its crackdown on undocumented immigrants. </p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Two eyewitnesses to the assassination of Charlie Kirk say America must return to civilized debate — even if their viewpoints don't otherwise align.</p><p>Hunter Kozak was the last person to speak to Kirk. A self-professed liberal who posts political TikTok videos, Kozak attended the event at Utah Valley University this month, aware that he was in the minority of attendees and eager to debate the conservative Turning Point USA founder. </p><p>He was at odds with Kirk on many issues, going so far as to suggest Kirk's policy proposals harmed the country. But Kozak especially wanted to challenge Kirk on his claims that linked transgender people to mass shootings. As the two began their pointed exchange, a sniper from a rooftop fatally wounded Kirk, mere feet from where Kozak was standing.</p><p>Jeb Jacobi says he saw Kirk as an inspiration. The Utah Valley University student was at the event volunteering for Turning Point USA, the organization Kirk co-founded in 2012 to advocate for conservatism on college campuses. It was Jacobi's second time meeting Kirk, whom he admired for the campus debates that made him popular online. Before this month's event, Jacobi took a photo with Kirk, and he was sitting nearby when Kirk was shot.</p><p>Today, Kozak and Jacobi come together on one thing: Americans need to keep having civil conversations — especially when they don't see eye-to-eye.</p>

<p>"I think that one of the few things that we can agree on is this necessity for a conversation," Kozak told 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley. "I think that we need to remember that we still have to live with each other. That these are still our neighbors."</p><p>Kozak told 60 Minutes that Kirk's team had pre-approved his question for the event, and he was placed second in line to ask it. He said he feels a weight in being the last person to have spoken to Kirk.</p><p>"I don't really know how to grapple with that," Kozak said. "I mean, he's answered tens of thousands of questions, and I just, that was the first question I've ever asked him. We never talked before that."</p><p>Jeb Jacobi recalled running toward safety after the shooting, calling his family to recount what he had seen. "He's been shot," Jacobi recalled telling his mother. "I literally watched a bullet enter his neck, and I watched him die in front of me."</p>

<p>Jacobi said Kirk's murder likely brings together moderate Democrats and Republicans, even as it drives apart the more radical elements in both political parties.</p><p>"I think that there needs to be effective communication between both parties in order to find solid ground on this issue," Jacobi told Pelley.</p><p>On the first day classes resumed at Utah Valley University after the shooting, Utah Governor Spencer Cox visited the campus to speak with students, promoting a similar message of civility and coming together.</p><p>"I think it's important not to tell people they shouldn't disagree that there's something wrong with disagreement, or that disagreement is the problem," Cox told a group of students. "It's not the problem, right? It's how we do that, if that matters."</p><p>Hunter Kozak told Pelley he appreciates the governor's message of unity but is aware of how appealing the message of vengeance can be when coming from politicians.</p><p>"My advice would be more towards the voters who vote for those politicians," Kozak said, "to look at what you are enabling with your vote and recognize that you have a lot more control over the situation together as a community than you might think."</p><p><em>The video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer and edited by Scott Rosann. </em></p>

<p>A lonely voice rose above the rancor after the murder of <span class="link">Charlie Kirk</span>. Spencer Cox, the Republican governor of Utah, may not have been familiar to many, but after the assassination in his state, he asked whether we could all "stop hating our fellow Americans." We wanted to hear more and we were surprised to learn the 50-year-old Republican has spent years campaigning for reconciliation. Cox is asking Americans to respect our differences, which, at this moment, is not universally admired in his own party.</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: I get accused on the right all the time of-- I just want people to have a "kumbaya" moment. I want people to hold hands and just hug it out. And we're done with that. We're done holding hands and hugging it out. I'm not asking anybody to hold hands and hug it out. I'm not asking for that. I'm trying to get people to stop shooting each other. That's it. And I think what I'm doing and what I'm saying is the best way to do that. Some people will disagree with that and that's OK. We should have these debates as a society. I'm not always right. I've made mistakes. Other politicians, I think, are making mistakes right now in trying to elevate the temperature. But, but I'm going to just keep having these conversations.</p><p>Scott Pelley: In this moment, what's at stake?</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Scott, I, I, I-- don't think it's hyperbole to say that the, the future of our country is at stake. This grand experiment that we embarked on 250 years ago, can we hold together?</p><p>Scott Pelley: And what if our politics cannot find the path to the brighter light?</p>

<p>Gov. Spencer Cox: That's the question I always ask. When I hear people say that, that we're at war. I say, "OK. And and and what? What does that mean? What is next? Who, who am I supposed to shoot now?"</p><p>The shot, September 10th, was the kind of attack now happening every couple of months or so. In April, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania and his family escaped after their home was <span class="link">firebombed</span>. In June, in theirhomes, two<span class="link"> Minnesota Democratic lawmakers</span> and their spouses were gunned down. A year earlier, on the campaign, it was <span class="link">Donald Trump</span> himself. When told this time it was Utah, Cox didn't believe it. But there it was on his phone.</p>
<p>Gov. Spencer Cox: The video was already out. There was no fog of war. There, there was no doubt what had happened. That terrible awful video that I wish I had not seen. I hate, again, social media, that almost every person in this country, including our young people, have seen that video on a loop over and over and over again. And I can't unsee it. I can't stop seeing it. Every time I close my eyes, that's what I see. </p><p>The governor sent an aide to the hospital, who reported that Kirk was dead. Cox dialed a number. </p>

<p>Scott Pelley: As you're calling the White House, what is in your heart?</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Just sickness. Nauseous. Disbelief. Anger. At this point, I'm very angry. </p><p><em>Gov. Spencer Cox (during press conference on Sept. 10, 2025): …to whoever did this, we will find you, we will try you and we will hold you accountable to the furthest extent of the law... </em></p><p>His anger was showing. </p><p><em>Gov. Spencer Cox (during press conference on Sept. 10, 2025): I just want to remind people that we still have the death penalty here in the state of Utah.</em></p><p>But when he searched for meaning, he recalled the suffering of both parties.</p><p><em>Gov. Spencer Cox (during press conference on Sept. 10, 2025): Our nation is broken. We've had political assassinations recently in Minnesota. We had an attempted assassination on the governor of Pennsylvania. And we had an attempted assassination on a presidential candidate and former president of the United States and now current president of the United States. Nothing I say can unite us as a country. Nothing I can say right now can fix what is broken. We just need every single person in this country to think about where we are and where we want to be. </em></p>

<p>Gov. Spencer Cox: I've been following, I've been studying political violence. And so I, I'm keenly aware when these things happen and I'm seeing, I'm seeing people get, get murdered, get attacked who are Democrats and Republicans and that's where it came from in that moment. </p><p>Scott Pelley: In the days after the murder, as you're trying to bring the country together, Steve Bannon, the philosopher of the MAGA Right, called you a national embarrassment.</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Yeah. I love free speech. I would give my life defending his right to say that about me. That's OK. We can have that debate. There are some people that think I am a national embarrassment. And that's OK too.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Who do you blame for the division? </p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: I do believe that social media is a cancer. And it is taking all of our worst impulses and putting them on steroids. It, it is driving us to division. It is driving us to hate. These algorithms that have captured our, our very souls. They've, they've captured our free agency. These dopamine hits that get our young people and our old people addicted to outrage and hate that serve us up on a regular basis are absolutely leading us down a, a very dark path. </p>
<p>A path through platforms that look like civil war, powered by algorithms, programs, written to amplify posts of rage. </p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: The algorithms are absolutely destroying us. Once they know what your political leanings are, then it's like a pack of wolves that just attack. We have this collective problem where- that we can't solve because we're all sucked in, and we don't know how to get out.</p>

<p>We met Spencer Cox in the capitol at the foot of the Wasatch Range in Salt Lake City. He was raised, one of eight, on a farm of modest means. He's a lawyer, devoutly Mormon, with three years left on his second term. His conservative record includes tax cuts, expansion of gun rights and restrictions on abortion.</p><p>Scott Pelley: You are a Republican but not a Trump Republican.</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Well, that, that depends. I did vote for him this last time. He…</p><p>Scott Pelley: But not in '16 or 2020.</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: That is also correct. And he gives me a very hard time about that every time we're, we're together. The tent is broad on the right. And I'm trying to show one way to do politics. </p><p>His way to do politics surprised many in 2020. Campaigning for governor, he refused to run negative ads. </p><p><em>Spencer Cox (campaign ad from 2020): I think you should vote for me. </em></p>

<p><em>Chris Peterson (campaign ad from 2020): Yeah, but, but really, you should vote for me.</em></p><p>Instead, he asked his Democratic opponent to join him on the air. </p><p><em>Spencer Cox (campaign ad from 2020):  We can disagree without hating each other. </em></p><p><em>Chris Peterson (campaign ad from 2020): And win or lose in Utah, we work together. </em></p><p><em>Spencer Cox (campaign ad from 2020): So, let's show the country that there's a better way. </em></p><p><em>Chris Peterson (campaign ad from 2020): My name's Chris Peterson </em></p><p><em>Spencer Cox (campaign ad from 2020): and I'm Spencer Cox, </em></p>

<p><em>Both (campaign ad from 2020): and we approve this message.</em></p><p>Cox took the message beyond Utah when, in 2023, he became chair of the bipartisan National Governors Association. There, he launched a campaign called "Disagree Better," and went back on the air. </p><p><em>(Disagree Better video from 2023) SPENCER COX: I'm Spencer Cox Republican governor of Utah, </em></p><p><em>(Disagree Better video from 2023) JARED POLIS: and I'm Jared Polis, Democratic governor of Colorado…</em></p><p>Twenty three governors from both parties joined "Disagree Better." </p><p><em>(Disagree Better video from 2023) SPENCER COX: Healthy disagreement means not assuming that the other side is deluded, misinformed or actively trying to overthrow America. </em></p><p>This month, Cox took the message to the University of Notre Dame. He's done more than 20 of these events nationwide, often with Democratic governors, including Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico.</p>
<p>Scott Pelley: Does Disagree Better mean that we should drop our differences and everybody meets in the middle?</p>

<p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Absolutely not. In fact, it's the exact opposite of that. Abortion is an issue on which we disagree passionately. And and yet, even though we have these very strong, it looks like a chasm between us, I think we would both agree that we should be doing more to take care of, of single moms. I think those are the types of things that we can agree on while still being pretty passionate about, about whether we think abortion should be legal or not.</p><p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham: And when you do that and we listen and we find that we-- there is some common ground, it-- it--reduces, right, lowers the temperature. It provides opportunity not just for discourse, but doing something.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Do governors understand something that Washington does not?</p><p>Both: Yes!</p><p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham: Yes. We're completely about results, not about rhetoric. </p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: We like to say that potholes aren't partisan. And governors do have to deliver actual results. I think there's, sadly, in in D.C. we've seen this performative politics, and, and, and much less substance.</p><p>Scott Pelley: There are some people watching this interview who are disgusted that you two are sitting together.</p>

<p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham: Well, we need courage over comfort. You know, I don't work for-- a partisan party. I work for every single New Mexican. </p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Yeah, I see her as an American before I see her as, as a Democrat or anything else. I think we need more of these conversations. I think we need them in our-- in our own homes, in our own neighborhoods, in our school boards, in our city councils all across the country. </p><p>The day Charlie Kirk was murdered, one of the first calls Spencer Cox received was from Democrat Michelle Lujan Grisham. </p><p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham: We should be condemning at every chance we get political violence. Our democracy falters when we don't. This is an American. This is a person. This is a person who lost his life in free speech. And there's real grieving for that family. And it doesn't end tomorrow. It will last a lifetime.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Says the Democrat.</p><p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham: Says the Democrat, because it's true. It's true.</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Please include that.</p>
<p>We returned with Spencer Cox to Utah Valley University.</p>

<p><em>Gov Spencer Cox (to crowd during Utah Valley University visit on Sept. 17, 2025): That flag, that doesn't represent any single group. It doesn't represent one part of our country and not another part of our country.</em></p><p>Students gathered where Charlie Kirk was killed. Cox told the crowd they can't count on politicians. Change, he said, must come from all of you.</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: I'm desperately looking for more architects and fewer arsonists. Again, it's so easy to burn down and tear down and-- and we've got too much of that today. I'm I'm hoping that a positive vision for our country, a positive vision for our party treating everyone with dignity and respect, that's how we get our country back.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Some people watching this interview might be thinking, "He should run for president." But the fact is you would never survive Republican primaries.</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Well, the thought of, of-- running for president makes me nauseous. I I, have no interest in that. I'm glad that there are good people who are willing to do that. But-- that is not something I've ever been interested in. And you're also correct. The, the, way we select our candidates makes it almost impossible for someone like me to have an opportunity.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Is it possible that your message is naïve, that the violence will just continue?</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: That's-- that's very possible, that's very possible. I think the founders were naïve to believe that they could start a new country based on very different principles than virtually any country in the history of the world. I think that it was naïve that-- we could rebuild after a civil war had fractured us and we had killed 600,000 of our fellow Americans. So, I believe that naiveté with-- some passion can change the world. It's probably the only thing that ever has. </p>

<p>A Texas man accused of threatening to commit a shooting at a local pride event has been arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to court documents obtained by CBS News.</p><p>Joshua Cole of Anson, Texas, allegedly commented on a Facebook post containing details of an upcoming gay pride event in nearby Abilene, "fk their parade" and said he wanted to "pay them back for taking out Charlie Kirk," according to an affidavit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas on Sept. 19 — nine days <span class="link">after the conservative activist was shot and killed in Utah</span>.</p><p>Posting under the name "Jay Dubya," Cole also allegedly wrote, "there's only like 30 of em we can send a clear message to the rest of them."</p><p>When the Abilene Police Department made a traffic stop on Cole, he admitted he runs a Facebook account under the name Jay Dubya, and that he was behind the comments, the criminal complaint alleged. He told officers that he did not believe that the gay pride event should be allowed, according to the court document, but denied that he was going to shoot parade participants.</p><p>Cole also admitted that he has a firearm. It wasn't clear whether he legally owns it.</p>

<p>"The threats were not conditional. The threats were specific," FBI Special Agent Samuel C. Venuti wrote in the affidavit. "The threats were also specific to a particular set of victims: people participating in the gay pride parade tomorrow. With this level of specificity, COLE's comments were not mere idle or careless talk, exaggeration, or something said in only a joking manner."</p><p>Venuti wrote that he visited Cole's former employer who told him Cole had recently quit his job and "stormed out of the facility in anger." He had worked for the employer for over a year, Venuti wrote, and was described by coworkers as a "hot head."</p><p>"We want to reassure our community that the safety of everyone at Pride has always been, and will continue to be our top priority," Abilene Pride Alliance posted on Facebook over a week after the incident. "The swift action and continued diligence of APD and federal partners reflect their commitment to protecting our city and ensuring that Pride remains a safe, inclusive and celebratory space for all."</p><p>Abilene Pride Alliance said in the post that the organization asked for help to strengthen security at Pride and received over $4,000 in donations. </p>

<p>"We want to reassure our community that the safety of everyone at Pride has always been, and will continue to be our top priority," the post reads. "The swift action and continued diligence of APD and federal partners reflect their commitment to protecting our city and ensuring that Pride remains a safe, inclusive and celebratory space for all."</p><p>CBS News reached out to an attorney listed for Cole. He was booked into Taylor County Jail in Abilene on Sept. 19. He was previously arrested in 2019 on a terroristic threat charge, according to jail records.</p><p>Jail records show Cole was released from Taylor County Jail on Sept. 24. The next day, the court concluded that Cole must be detained pending trial for reasons including his prior criminal history, that the weight of evidence against him is strong and that his release poses "serious danger to any person or the community."</p><p>It wasn't immediately clear whether Cole had been released prior to the decision or whether he was transferred to another facility.</p>

<p>Amir Amiri, an American citizen detained nine months ago in Afghanistan, was released Sunday and is on his way back to the United States, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced.</p><p>"Today we welcome home Amir Amiry, an American who was wrongfully detained in Afghanistan," wrote Rubio in a social media post. "I want to thank Qatar for helping secure his freedom."</p><p>A source with knowledge of the release previously told CBS News that Qatari diplomats had coordinated with the office of the U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs to facilitate it. After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, Qatar signed an accord to represent U.S. interests in the country. Before Amiri, it had helped secure the release of four other American citizens from Afghanistan earlier this year.</p><p>Amiri was detained in December 2024. Qatar began negotiating for his release in March, at first arranging a meeting between Amiri and the U.S. Special Envoy Adam Boehler during his visit to Afghanistan, according to the source with knowledge of his release. Qatari diplomats monitored Amiri's health and maintained close communication with U.S. officials throughout his detention, the source told CBS News.</p>
<p>Negotiations persisted for several months until Qatar reached a breakthrough this weekend, which resulted in Amiri's release, the source said.</p>

<p><span class="link">Two American citizens were freed</span> in a prisoner swap between the U.S. and the Taliban in January, one of whom, Ryan Corbett, had been abducted in 2022 while on a work trip. The Taliban agreed to release them from Afghanistan in exchange for Khan Mohammed, a Taliban figure who had been imprisoned for life in California on drug trafficking and terrorism charges, officials told the Associated Press at the time. </p><p>Another two Americans were released from Afghanistan in March. <span class="link">Faye Hall</span>, who had been detained earlier in the year on charges of using an unauthorized drone, was arrested with a British couple who remained in Taliban custody, sources told CBS News after Hall's release. The British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, were freed earlier this month. Separately, American <span class="link">George Glezmann</span> was also freed in March after being detained during a tourist visit to Afghanistan in 2022, in a move that the former U.S. envoy to Afghanistan called "a goodwill gesture" to President Trump by the Taliban. </p>
