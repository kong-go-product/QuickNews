                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Humberto grew into a<span class="link">Category 4 hurricane</span> on Friday evening, "rapidly strengthening" into a major hurricane, but there were no immediate watches or warnings issued for the U.S. by the National Hurricane Center. </p><p>The storm is <span class="link">one of two systems</span> swirling over the western Atlantic that could potentially bring some downstream impacts to parts of the Southeast U.S. coast, from Florida to North Carolina, the director of the Miami-based hurricane center, Michael Brennan, said.</p><p>There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect due to either storm as of Friday afternoon. </p>
<h2>Hurricane Humberto forecast and path</h2><p>As of Friday night, Humberto was located about 390 miles northeast of the northern Leeward Islands. It was moving west at about 7 mph with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph. A storm is deemed a "major" hurricane if it's a Category 3, 4 or 5 due to the potential for "significant loss of life and damage," the NHC says.</p><p>"Rapid strengthening should continue over the central Atlantic," the hurricane center said Friday night.</p>
<p>Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles from the center of Humberto, and hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles, the hurricane center said.</p>

<p>It is the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. It comes on the heels of <span class="link">Hurricane Gabrielle</span>, which is not impacting land as it heads farther out into the Atlantic.</p><h2>Another storm system brews over the Caribbean</h2><p>The hurricane center is also closely monitoring a second storm system over the northeast Caribbean in the Atlantic, near Humberto. </p><p>The system is likely to become a tropical depression on Saturday, a tropical storm by Sunday and a hurricane by late Monday, forecasters said. </p>
<p>The system is expected to bring "significant rainfall" to portions of Cuba and the Bahamas. Cuba could see up to 16 inches of rain, while the Bahamas could receive up to 8 inches, the hurricane center said. </p>

<p>The system is expected "to move across the central and northwestern Bahamas this weekend and approach the southeast U.S. coast early next week," the hurricane center said Friday. </p>
<p>There is also a possibility it <span class="link">could interact with Humberto</span> — a phenomenon known as <span class="link">the Fujiwhara effect</span>, in which two different storms converge and either join or spin around each other. But CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said such an outcome is not considered likely in this case.</p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Shane Tamura, the gunman who killed four people in July's <span class="link">deadly Midtown Manhattan shooting</span>, had low-stage CTE, officials said Friday. </p><p>New York's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner revealed the results Friday. </p><p>"Following a thorough assessment and extensive analysis by our neuropathology experts, OCME has found unambiguous diagnostic evidence of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, also known as CTE, in the brain tissue of the decedent. The findings correspond with the classification of low-stage CTE, according to current consensus criteria," OCME said in a statement. </p><p>Tamura, a 27-year-old former high school football player, shot and killed <span class="link">Aland Etienne</span>, <span class="link">Wesley LePatner</span>, <span class="link">Julia Hyman</span> and <span class="link">NYPD Det. Didraul Islam</span> on July 28. He then shot himself in the chest. </p><p>He <span class="link">left handwritten notes</span>, <span class="link">repeatedly referencing CTE</span> and writing, "Study my brain please. I'm sorry."  </p>

<p>Though Tamura never played in the NFL, investigators believe he was <span class="link">targeting the NFL offices</span> inside the office building where he killed four people.</p><p>"The League knowingly concealed the dangers to our brains to maximize profits," Tamura wrote. </p><p>The three-page note found in Tamura's pocket said that he wanted to have his brain donated to science so it could be researched, according to law enforcement sources.</p><p>Tamura's family previously said he suffered from migraines and mental illness, as well as multiple concussions. </p>

<h2>What is CTE?</h2><p>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, is a brain disease that is most common in athletes who play contact sports, such as football players, ice hockey players and boxers. It is a degenerative disease, occurring after repeated head injuries cause cells in the brain to die. It can only be diagnosed in brain tissue after death.</p><p>Tamura's final note also included the name of <span class="link">Chris Nowinski, a leading CTE expert</span>. </p><p>"He played for 12 years. I think that's one of the more important points, is that 12 years absolutely puts you at risk for developing CTE," Nowinski said. "Low-stage CTE does represent significant changes to the brain. Brain cell death in the frontal lobes, which will affect judgment and behavior. There's no question about that." </p><p>The medical examiner's office said "the physical and mental manifestations of CTE remain under study." </p><p>Nowinski said the four victims of the shooting must remain the focus, but says this incident is a wake-up call. </p><p>"We shouldn't look at this and say 'this is why he did it,'" Nowinski said. "This hopefully is a wake-up call that we need to do more to prevent brain trauma in young athletes, because there are consequences for some of these people." </p><h2>What are the symptoms of CTE?</h2><p>There can be a variety of symptoms of CTE, including behavioral changes like aggression and impulsivity, irritability and inattention. </p>

<p>"There are people who have been diagnosed with CTE who have engaged in violent acts. It is not accurate, I don't think, to say that CTE causes violence," said Dr. Kristen Dams-O'Connor, director of the Brain Injury Research Center at Mount Sinai.</p><p>While damage may begin in the frontal lobes of the brain, over time it can affect widespread regions, causing memory loss and dementia. </p><p>Symptoms of CTE do not typically appear right after someone receives a head injury, but rather develop as time goes on, according to the Mayo Clinic.</p><p>O'Connor said CTE is rare in people with limited head trauma exposure, but she stresses a major takeaway in this incident is that anyone experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety, or having suicidal or homicidal thoughts should seek care.</p><h2>CTE in the NFL</h2><p>More cases of the disease have recently been found <span class="link">in former NFL players.</span> </p><p>Aaron Hernandez, a former New England Patriots player and convicted murderer, was diagnosed with stage 3 CTE after his death. </p><p>Former NFL player and CBS Sports analyst Irv Cross was diagnosed with stage 4 CTE. His widow said that at the time of his death, <span class="link">he was seeing things.</span></p>

<p>The Boston University CTE Center said that out of 376 former NFL players it has tested, 345 had CTE. </p><p>The NFL has made changes in recent years to prevent head injuries, including new rules and equipment.</p><p>"The NFL does acknowledge CTE and will tell you the 100 things they're doing to try to prevent it," Nowinski said.</p><p>"We continue to grieve the senseless loss of lives, and our hearts remain with the victims' families and our dedicated employees," the NFL said in a statement Friday. "There is no justification for the horrific acts that took place. As the medical examiner notes, 'the science around this condition continues to evolve, and the physical and mental manifestations of CTE remain under study'."</p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Attorney General Pam Bondi said late Friday she has ordered Justice Department agents to guard Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities — and directed counterterrorism task forces to look into attacks against federal authorities.</p><p>The move by Bondi came after one detainee was killed and two others were injured in a <span class="link">shooting</span> at an ICE field office in Dallas on Wednesday, the latest shooting or threat targeting an <span class="link">ICE facility</span> or immigration agent in recent months. </p><p>"At my direction, I am deploying DOJ agents to ICE facilities—and wherever ICE comes under siege—to safeguard federal agents, protect federal property, and immediately arrest all individuals engaged in any federal crime," Bondi wrote on X.</p><p>It's not clear which federal law enforcement agencies will be deployed to ICE facilities. The Justice Department oversees the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p><p>ICE has said attacks on its agents have spiked this year, as the Trump administration uses the agency to dramatically increase arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants. In recent months, ICE operations in <span class="link">Los Angeles</span>, <span class="link">Chicago</span>, <span class="link">New York</span> and elsewhere have drawn tense protests and clashes between agents and demonstrators.</p>

<p>Bondi also floated a broader crackdown on "repeated acts of violence and obstruction against federal agents." She directed the Joint Terrorism Task Forces — which are regional entities scattered throughout the country that work with the FBI and with state and local police — to look into what she described as "domestic terrorism."</p><p>"The Department of Justice will seek the most serious available charges against all participants in these criminal mobs, including conspiracy offenses, assault offenses, civil disorder offenses, and terrorism offenses," the attorney general wrote Friday.</p><p>A day earlier, President Trump signed a memo calling for investigations into "political violence and intimidation," led by the Joint Terrorism Task Forces. The White House pointed to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk earlier this month, last year's assassination attempts against Mr. Trump, and an increase in attacks on ICE officers.</p><p>The president also <span class="link">penned an executive order</span> labeling antifa a domestic terrorist organization. The move's legal implications aren't clear. Antifa, short for "anti-fascist," generally refers to a loose collection of largely left-wing activists, not a cohesive organization with a leadership structure. Also, domestic terrorism <span class="link">isn't a chargeable offense</span> under federal law, and the government doesn't have a formal list of domestic terrorist groups, unlike with foreign groups.</p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><span class="link">Humberto</span>, the eighth named storm to emerge this hurricane season, is currently swirling over waters just north of the Caribbean as a major hurricane. While forecasts as of Friday predict Humberto won't ever touch land, there is a possibility it could interact with another system developing nearby in the western Atlantic. </p><p>That's an unlikely outcome, said CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan. But if such a collision does occur, it could produce what's called <span class="link">the Fujiwhara effect</span>, a rare phenomenon in which two different storms merge and become entangled around a newly formed, common center. </p><p>How the process plays out depends on the characteristics of the storms involved, according to the National Weather Service. The forecasting agency describes the Fujiwhara effect on its website as "an intense dance" between two tropical storms that can happen when they get close enough to each other on their respective tracks to reach a common point and either join together or spin around each other for a period of time before continuing along their individual paths.  </p>
<p>In the latter scenario, the storms involved must be comparably strong or large.</p><p>"Typically when one system is stronger than the other, the smaller and weaker system will get overrun by the larger, stronger one and completely eliminate it," Nolan said. </p><p>Similar systems "will dance around each other" before going their separate ways, she continued, adding: "Very rarely has a larger system absorbed a smaller one and become larger or stronger, but it is scientifically possible."</p>

<p>Humberto grew into a tropical storm Wednesday night while traveling over open waters in the central tropical Atlantic, and then gained hurricane status early Friday morning. Humberto was a <span class="link">Category 4</span> storm as of late Friday evening. </p><p>Forecasters expect it to move northwest over the next few days and strengthen along the way, the National Hurricane Center said. It's one of two systems in the region that could potentially impact parts of the southeastern United States, including coastal areas from Florida to North Carolina, according to Michael Brennan, director of the hurricane center.</p>
<p>Officials at the center said Wednesday that they were monitoring a second storm churning near Humberto over the northeastern Caribbean, which would likely become a tropical depression later in the week and a tropical storm, named Imelda, over the weekend. That system is expected to strengthen as it tracks toward the Bahamas — driving up the chances of storm surge, wind and rainfall striking coastal parts of the southeastern U.S.</p><p>"With the two tropical troubles currently north of the Caribbean, these two may interact under the Fujiwhara effect in the days ahead," said Nolan. However, because the developing system "appears to be much weaker than Humberto and several miles away from it," an interaction between the two — if one even takes place at all — may not result in a tangled gravitational "dance." </p>

<p>In the event Humberto and the second system do collide, it's possible the paths they're expected to travel will change, Nolan added, but only slightly.</p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>MyPillow founder <span class="link">Mike Lindell</span>, an ally of President Trump, defamed the election technology company Smartmatic with false statements that its voting machines helped rig the 2020 presidential election, a federal judge in Minnesota ruled Friday.</p><p>But U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan deferred until future proceedings the question of whether Lindell — one of the country's most prominent propagators <span class="link">of false claims</span> that the 2020 election was a fraud — acted with the "actual malice" that Smartmatic still needs to prove to collect any damages.</p><p>The judge said there are "genuine fact disputes" as to whether Lindell's statements were made "with knowledge that they were false or made with reckless disregard to their falsity." He noted that the defense says Lindell has an "unwavering belief" that his statements were truthful.</p><p>The statements cited by the judge arose from Lindell's criticism of the results of the 2020 election in California's Los Angeles County, which former President Joe Biden carried with 71% of the vote over Mr. Trump and helped Biden secure the state's 55 electoral votes.</p><p>The county used Smartmatic's computerized touchscreen ballot-marking devices and was the company's only customer for the 2020 election. Lindell alleged the machines were rigged to change Trump votes to Biden votes.</p>

<p>The judge ruled there were 51 specific times when Lindell falsely claimed — in documentaries he produced and through various media and personal appearances — that Smartmatic interfered with the results.</p><p>"The Court concludes that, based on the record presented, no reasonable trier of fact could find that any of the statements at issue are true," Bryan wrote.</p><p>Smartmatic attorney Erik Connolly said they will be seeking "nine-figure damages" from Lindell and MyPillow for "spreading lies" about the company.</p><p>"Smartmatic did not and could not have rigged the 2020 election," Connolly said in a statement. "It was impossible, and everything that Mr. Lindell said about Smartmatic was false."</p>

<p>Lindell told The Associated Press shortly after the Smartmatic ruling was filed Friday that he hadn't seen it, but that it was "the most bizarre thing I've ever heard."</p><p>Lindell went on to call Smartmatic "one of the most corrupt companies in the world," and he vowed to keep fighting until its voting machines are "melted down and turned into prison bars." He said he'll take his crusade to eliminate voting machines in favor of paper ballots all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if he has to.</p><p>Smartmatic has been on a winning streak, having reached settlements last year with two conservative news outlets, <span class="link">including Newsmax</span> and One America News Network. The Florida-based company also still has an active case against Fox News.</p><p>Lindell also has made similar claims against Dominion Voting Systems. He lost a case involving the Denver-based company in June <span class="link">when a jury ruled</span> that he defamed a former Dominion employee by accusing him of treason. The jury awarded $2.3 million in damages.</p><p>Lindell, a Republican, also told CBS News in a text message Friday that he is considering a gubernatorial run in Minnesota, confirming local news reports in the state. Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz <span class="link">announced last week</span> he is running for a third term.</p><p>"I am considering running," Lindell wrote. "...We are doing our due-diligence and so far things are looking very good!"</p><p>He added, "I will certainly be adding securing our elections to my platform! We polled Minnesota and secure our elections was the #3 concern!"</p>

<p>MyPillow is headquartered in the Minneapolis metropolitan area.</p><p>Lindell and MyPillow have faced a number of legal and financial setbacks in recent years, but he won a victory in July when a federal appeals court ruled he didn't have to pay <span class="link">a $5 million arbitration award</span> to a software engineer who disputed data that Lindell claimed proved China interfered in the 2020 election. The court said the arbitration panel overstepped its authority.</p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is warning consumers not to eat certain ready-to-eat pasta meals sold at Walmart and Trader Joe's stores because they may be contaminated with listeria bacteria previously linked to a <span class="link">deadly outbreak</span> tied to pre-made chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals.</p><p>In an announcement Thursday, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued a public health alert for Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs &amp; Marinara Sauce sold at Walmart in refrigerated 12-ounce clear plastic trays. The products have best-by dates of Sept. 22 through Oct. 1 and may still be in consumers' refrigerators.</p><p>In an update on Friday, the FSIS added to its public health alert some meals sold at Trader Joe's, the Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo, sold in 16-ounce plastic tray packages with "best if used by" dates of Sept. 20, Sept. 24 or Sept. 27. The products contain the establishment number "P- 45288" inside the USDA mark of inspection.</p><p>The affected meals from Walmart contain the establishment numbers "EST. 50784" and "EST. 47718" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the label. They were sent to Walmart stores nationwide.</p>
<p>"The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority. We have removed this product from our impacted stores and we are working with the supplier to investigate," a Walmart spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News on Friday. </p>

<p>There have been no reported illness complaints for the product in question, and consumers should discard the meals if they have them and can receive a full refund at any Walmart store. </p><p>No recall has been issued, but FreshRealm, a large food producer that distributed the products, said they advised Walmart this week to pull the meals from store shelves. Additional products may be identified, according to the FSIS. Walmart officials said they put a stop to sales and removed the products from stores. </p><p>The meals may be contaminated with the same strain of listeria that caused an outbreak tied to chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals sold at Walmart and Kroger stores. Four people were killed and at least 20 were sickened in the outbreak, which federal health officials updated on Friday evening. The outbreak <span class="link">led to a large recall this summer</span>.</p><p>"FreshRealm held beef meatball marinara linguine meals after they tested positive for the outbreak strain," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its update Friday. "Pasta that went into the beef meatball marinara linguine meals has tested positive for Listeria, but additional information is pending to determine if the samples taken from the pre-cooked pasta is the same strain making people sick. Do not eat affected foods, return them or throw them out."</p>

<p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Lindsey Vaala expressed confusion and surprise at some points during the seven-minute court session when a federal grand jury impaneled in Alexandria, Virginia,  <span class="link">returned the indictment</span> of former FBI Director James Comey Thursday night.</p><p>According to a transcript of the proceedings obtained by CBS News, Judge Vaala asked the newly named interim U.S. Attorney <span class="link">Lindsey Halligan</span> — a former Trump personal lawyer — why there were two versions of the indictment.</p><p>A majority of the grand jury that reviewed the Comey matter <span class="link">voted not to charge him</span> with one of the three counts presented by prosecutors, according to a form that was signed by the grand jury's foreperson and filed in court. He was indicted on two other counts — making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding — after 14 of 23 jurors voted in favor of them, the foreperson told the judge. </p><p>But two versions of the indictment were published on the case docket: one with the dropped third count, and one without. The transcript reveals why this occurred. </p><p>"So this has never happened before. I've been handed two documents that are in the Mr. Comey case that are inconsistent with one another," Vaala said to Halligan. "There seems to be a discrepancy. They're both signed by the (grand jury) foreperson." </p>

<p>And she noted that one document did not clearly indicate what the grand jury had decided.</p><p>"The one that says it's a failure to concur in an indictment, it doesn't say with respect to one count," Vaala said. "It looks like they failed to concur across all three counts, so I'm a little confused as to why I was handed two things with the same case number that are inconsistent."</p><p>Halligan initially responded that she hadn't seen that version of the indictment.</p><p>"So I only reviewed the one with the two counts that our office redrafted when we found out about the two — two counts that were true billed, and I signed that one. I did not see the other one. I don't know where that came from," Halligan told the judge.</p>

<p>Vaala responded, "You didn't see it?" And Halligan again told her, "I did not see that one."</p><p>Vaala seemed surprised: "So your office didn't prepare the indictment that they —"</p><p>Halligan then replied, "No, no, no — I — no, I prepared three counts. I only signed the one — the two-count (indictment). I don't know which one with three counts you have in your hands."</p><p>"Okay. It has your signature on it," Vaala told Halligan, who responded, "Okay. Well."</p><p>Vaala also noted that the court session began unusually late, at 6:47 p.m. Thursday evening, telling the grand jurors "I don't think we've ever met this late" as she thanked them for their service.</p><p>The charges against Comey — which accuse him of lying in testimony he gave to the Senate in 2020 — mark an unprecedented step for the Justice Department, after President Trump publicly urged prosecutors to look into the ex-FBI leader that he fired in 2017 and sparred with for years. </p><p>In an unusual move, Comey's indictment was personally signed by Halligan, not a rank-and-file federal prosecutor. Halligan was <span class="link">sworn in on Monday</span>, after days of upheaval in the U.S. attorney's office in Alexandria. </p>

<p>The former head of the office, Erik Siebert, <span class="link">announced his resignation on Friday</span> following worries among his staff that he could be fired for failing to criminally charge another Trump adversary, New York Attorney General Letitia James. A day later, Mr. Trump announced Siebert had been fired, and posted a message suggesting Attorney General Pam Bondi should look into Comey, James and a third longtime Trump foil, Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.</p><p>Before Comey was indicted, staff at the U.S. attorney's office circulated a memo that argued charges should not be brought against the former FBI director, a Justice Department source familiar with the matter told CBS News.</p><p>Attorney General Pam Bondi praised Halligan in a post on X Friday, writing that she "did an outstanding job."</p>

<p>The cause of death of <span class="link">Travis Decker</span>, the man accused of killing his three young daughters earlier this year in Washington state before disappearing and sparking a <span class="link">monthslong manhunt</span>, "may never be known," the local county coroner told CBS News on Friday.  </p><p>Chelan County Coroner Wayne Harris told CBS News that Decker's "cause and manner" of death, along with the time of death, couldn't be determined.</p><p>Harris said the coroner's office received only "minimal skeletal remains," and with so much time having passed since the death, "there is nothing to autopsy."</p><p>"The only examination done at this point was by a forensic anthropologist," Harris said in an email Friday. </p><p>Local law enforcement confirmed Thursday that the human remains that were <span class="link">found in Washington state</span> last week came back as a match for Decker after DNA testing.</p>

DNA testing confirmed he was the only suspect in the murders, police have said.</p><p>The search for Decker began May 30, after the girls' mother reported he failed to return them to her Wenatchee, Washington, home, about 100 miles east of Seattle, following a scheduled visit.</p><p>Three days later, authorities discovered the girls' bodies down an embankment at a Cascade Mountains campsite, their wrists bound with zip ties.

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would impose a new round of tariffs, including a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30% tariff on heavy trucks. </p><p>In social media posts to Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the new tariffs would take effect Oct. 1. </p><p>Mr. Trump said in his posts that the 100% tariff on "any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product" would not apply to companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., which he defined as either "breaking ground" or being "under construction."</p><p>In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shockwaves to voters <span class="link">as health care expenses</span>, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.</p><p>Still, some experts think the new pharma tariffs could end up having only a modest impact, noting that generic drugs are exempt. The loophole for drugmakers with operations in the U.S. is also likely to soften the blow, Neal Shearing, group chief economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.</p>

<p>"Many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies either already have some production in the U.S. or have announced plans to build production in the near future," he said. "Add in the fact that pharmaceuticals is the one area where we think there may have been significant inventory accumulation this year, as importers have sought to front-run potential tariffs, and the impact on the effective tariff rate is likely to be small."</p><h2>Higher costs for home furnishings?</h2><p>Trump argued that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were "flooding" the U.S. with their products and that tariffs must be applied "for National Security and other reasons." </p><p>The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people <span class="link">seeking to buy a house</span> feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.</p><p>Last month, Mr. Trump announced on social media that a "major Tariff Investigation" was being conducted on furniture coming into the U.S. and said that within the next 50 days, the investigation would be completed, and a tariff rate would be announced. </p>

<p>The president said the 25% tariff on "all 'Heavy (Big!) Trucks' made in other parts of the world" was "in order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition." </p><p>"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions," Trump posted.</p><p>Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration's broad tariffs defied predictions that they would fuel inflation, but that respite seems to have ended after <span class="link">economic data this month showed</span> the duties are now driving prices upward. The Consumer Price Index in <span class="link">August rose at a rate of 2.9%</span> from a year ago, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Mr. Trump <span class="link">first launched a sweeping set</span> of import taxes.</p><p>Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.</p><p>"There's no inflation," Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday. "We're having unbelievable success."</p>

<p><em>The new CBS Reports documentary "Boys to Men: Why America's Sons Are Struggling" premieres Saturday, Sept. 27, at 5 p.m. ET on CBS News 24/7 and Paramount+.</em></p><p><em>Oberlin, Ohio —</em> Every other week, Johnny Cole, the founder of Hey Brother, and David Reese, a language arts teacher at Oberlin High School in Oberlin, Ohio, lead a group of more than a dozen high school boys in lessons and discussions focused on the role of men in today's world — a program they call Men's Work.</p><p>"I think boys, in particular, feel this emotional roller coaster, this push and pull of, like, on the one hand, I'm hearing from media and news that I think men should be able to cry," Cole told CBS News. "But I also don't feel like I can express myself, don't have enough adult men in my life that actually model that for me." </p><p>Cole says Hey Brother is an organization that seeks to challenge and examine what it means to be a modern man.</p><p>According to a survey released earlier this year by the Pew Research Center, only 38% of teen boys say they are comfortable talking about their mental health with friends, compared to 58% for teen girls.  </p>

<p>In the same survey, 43% of teen boys said they feel pressure to be physically strong. It's one reason that some young men are drawn to social influencers collectively known as the "manosphere," a term widely used to describe the ecosystem of content aimed at men. </p><p>The Men's Work sessions are designed to discuss and challenge messaging from the "manosphere" that students like Santos Navarro, a senior at Oberlin High, are frequently exposed to online.</p><p>"I like to work out a lot, and I feel like there's a lot of, like, these influencers now that try to tell kids nowadays, use steroids and stuff like that," Navarro said. </p><p>According to a 2023 survey by the American Psychological Association, teens and young adults who reduced their social media use by 50% saw significant improvement in how they felt about their weight and overall appearance.</p>

<p>"There's a pain that's there, and that pain is real and it's authentic," Reese said. "It's understandable, the draw to the manosphere, because, you know, who else is actually talking about some of the struggles of what it means to be a boy, and trying to understand these feelings and emotions? And you're hearing from people who look and sound like they got it all together. It's pain layered on pain that's there. We're just trying to offer a more loving way to move forward."</p>

<p><em>Philadelphia</em> — Just about everyone at a Major League Baseball game wants a foul ball, and 9-year-old Jameson Pennings is no exception.  </p><p>Jameson so wanted a ball earlier this month that his parents, James and Eve Pennings, bought tickets to a Sept. 10 Philadelphia Phillies home game versus the New York Mets, with seats along the third base line, down near where the ball girl sometimes tosses foul balls into the crowd.  </p><p>And sure enough, in the fifth inning, that is exactly what happened.</p><p>"He sat and he cherished it and at one point he's like, 'Dad, is that where the bat hit?'" James told CBS News. "'Oh, yeah, that's where the bat hit.'"</p><p>James thought Jameson would cherish the ball "forever." But forever only lasted four more innings. </p>

<p>"I'm still astounded," James said of what his son did next. </p><p>"I'm very proud of him," Eve added. </p><p>Unbeknownst to his parents, earlier in the game, Jameson overheard a woman talking to that same ball girl. The woman was hoping to get a foul ball for her mother, Donna Morey, who was at the game, celebrating her 80th birthday.</p><p>Unfortunately, getting anyone on the field to toss you a foul ball is a charm offensive that heavily favors the young. Jameson knew the odds of an 80-year-old getting a ball were slim to none. So, he walked over to her, treasure in hand.</p>

<p>"I was so shocked," Morey told CBS News. "I just didn't know what to say. It was unbelievable to me. It really was. And I said, 'Why are you giving it to me?'"</p><p>"I thought, she is way older, and she can't come to many more games, and I can go to more, and get many more balls," Jameson said. </p><p>Donna accepted his gift.</p><p>"It symbolizes goodness in this world," Donna said. </p><p>And Jameson says he is so glad she did, because he's actually happier without it.</p><p>"I will leave feeling really good about myself," Jameson said. "So does it really matter that I left without a ball?"</p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump told his administration on Friday to declassify any federal records <span class="link">about Amelia Earhart</span>, the pilot whose 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean has drawn decades of public fascination.</p><p>"Amelia made it almost three quarters around the World before she suddenly, and without notice, vanished, never to be seen again," the president wrote on Truth Social. "Her disappearance, almost 90 years ago, has captivated millions."</p><p>Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared as they flew toward Howland Island in the Pacific, part of her attempt to become the first female aviator to circumnavigate the world. </p><p>It's widely believed that Earhart crashed into the ocean near Howland Island after running out of fuel, says Laurie Gwen Shapiro, a journalist who wrote a book on Earhart. But other theories about where she and her plane ended up have circulated for decades — many of which lack clear evidence. Researchers are <span class="link">planning an expedition</span> to a remote island later this year.</p>
<p>It's not clear what, if any, classified documents the government may have on Earhart.  </p>

<p>But a lawmaker who represents the Northern Mariana Islands territory in the U.S. House pushed Mr. Trump to declassify and release Earhart records earlier this year, referring to "credible, firsthand accounts" that the aviator was spotted on the Pacific island of Saipan.</p><p>"Despite these recollections, her disappearance and the possibility that she may have died on our islands remain matters of unresolved historical inquiry," Del. Kimberlyn King-Hinds, a Republican, wrote in a July letter to the president.</p><p>One of the theories is that Earhart was on a spy mission for the U.S. government when she landed in Saipan and was taken into custody by the Japanese. </p><p>Documents previously released by the FBI contain a 1967 request for a security review of a manuscript that cites Navy files on Earhart that were marked "confidential," a level of classification. The manuscript's author, a senior officer in the Air Force, wrote that the conclusions in the Navy report were that Earhart was not on a spy mission, did not crash-land in Saipan, and was not held as a prisoner or executed as a spy. </p>

<p>The FBI, in approving that manuscript for publication — which is a typical process for current and former government officials — noted that the Navy files did "not warrant classification since the release of it would not be prejudicial to the national defense." </p><p>Shapiro called the theory that Earhart was taken captive in Saipan "nonsense."</p><p>"It's 99.9% that she ran out of gas," Shapiro told CBS News. She said Earhart and Noonan were low on fuel and "very ill-prepared" for their attempted flight to Howland Island, a tiny, difficult-to-find island in the middle of the ocean.</p><p>"It's very boring to tell people, you know what, she ran out of gas," Shapiro said. "The fantasy around it is amazing."</p><p>The National Archives and Records Administration has also previously released documents on the search for Earhart.  </p><p>In 1993, two Hawaiian lawmakers introduced bills in the House and Senate to require the government to release all records relating to Earhart's last flight and disappearance. The bills called for the declassification of any such relevant records that have been classified as government secrets. The measures never made it out of the committees they were referred to. </p><p>Mr. Trump's push to declassify Earhart records follows his decision <span class="link">to release records</span> on the 1960s-era assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr., <span class="link">John F. Kennedy</span> and <span class="link">Robert F. Kennedy</span>. His administration is also under pressure to release records on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

<p><em>Washington — </em>The <span class="link">indictment of former FBI Director James Comey</span> on Thursday marked the culmination of President Trump's yearslong desire to see one of his political foes punished after the bureau's investigation into his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian meddling in that election.</p><p>But the president's long-held ire toward Comey, coupled with his latest comments cheering the federal charges brought against the former FBI chief, could aid defense lawyers in a potential bid to have the case against Comey tossed.</p><p>"In this case, the facts before the indictment and even comments Trump made after the indictment provide strong factual evidence that Mr. Comey is the victim of either selective or vindictive prosecution," Gene Rossi, a former federal prosecutor who worked at the Justice Department for nearly 30 years, told CBS News.</p><p>A federal grand jury returned an indictment against Comey charging him with two counts: making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. It declined to indict him on an additional count of lying to Congress, <span class="link">a rare rejection</span> of a proposed charge.</p><p>The charges stem from Comey's September 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which he denied authorizing anyone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports.</p>

<p>Whether to seek an indictment had been met with pushback from career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which is prosecuting the case. Staff in the office had circulated a "declination" memo explaining why criminal charges should not be filed against Comey, a Justice Department source told CBS News.</p><p>But days before Comey was charged, and after <span class="link">the abrupt departure of Erik Siebert</span> as the top prosecutor in the Virginia office, Mr. Trump <span class="link">installed a White House aide</span> and his former personal defense lawyer Lindsey Halligan as Siebert's replacement.</p><p>Halligan has no prosecutorial experience. Only she signed Comey's indictment, and Halligan remains the only attorney listed as representing the U.S.</p><p>Comey denied any wrongdoing, and said in a video shared to social media, "I'm innocent, so let's have a trial and keep the faith." His lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, said Comey will be vindicated in court.</p>

<p>Legal experts expect Fitzgerald will seek to have the case dismissed on numerous grounds, including selective prosecution, which is when the prosecutor appears motivated by discriminatory intent, and vindictive prosecution, when the government acts out of "genuine" animus or seeks to punish a defendant for exercising a legal right. </p><p>Carissa Byrne Hessick, a law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are difficult to prevail on, and it's tough to predict whether Comey will succeed in convincing a judge to dismiss his charges on those grounds.</p><p>Courts are generally hostile to those claims — the legal standard is high for proving them and judges are concerned about opening the floodgates to these types of motions, Hessick said. But on the other hand, Comey's case may look different than others given the events leading up to his indictment, namely the appointment of Halligan and reports of internal disagreement over seeking charges, she said.</p><p>"The mixture of those two things — the fact that these sorts of cases are very hard to win, but also the unusual circumstances and the availability of evidence — I think makes it too difficult to predict what a court will do here," Hessick said.</p><p>Mr. Trump has for years railed against Comey publicly, claiming he should be prosecuted for "treason" and calling him "corrupt," "stupid" and a "dirty cop," among other insults. In a social media post Saturday, the president made a direct appeal to Attorney General Pam Bondi for action against Comey and two other political opponents: New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.</p><p>Mr. Trump wrote the three are "guilty as hell" and said, "We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!"</p><p>The president then cheered Comey's indictment Thursday night.</p>

<p>"One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI," Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. "Today he was indicted by a Grand Jury on two felony counts for various illegal and unlawful acts. He has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"</p><p>The attacks on Comey continued Friday, with Mr. Trump calling him a "destroyer of lives" who must pay a "very big price" for lying.</p><p>"Whether you like Corrupt James Comey or not, and I can't imagine too many people liking him, HE LIED!" Mr. Trump wrote. "It is not a complex lie, it's a very simple, but IMPORTANT one. There is no way he can explain his way out of it. He is a Dirty Cop, and always has been."</p><p>Rossi said the years of comments made by Mr. Trump from the spring of 2017 — when the president fired Comey during his first term — to now, could bolster Comey's bid to have the charges dismissed.</p><p>"Whether vindictive or selective, this animus, the hatred, the prejudice toward who is charged, those emotions and factors become highly relevant," he said.</p><p>But it's not just comments from Mr. Trump that could come into play. Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel also cheered the charges against Comey, with Patel claiming Comey and other top FBI officials weaponized federal law enforcement when they led the bureau.</p><p>"They are putting their thumb on the scale of justice instead of letting Lady Justice handle this matter blindly," Rossi said. "That violates every norm — every norm — that a federal prosecutor is taught from the time they're born as baby prosecutors."</p>

<p>He said the grand jury's rejection of the third count, lying to Congress, is "another brick in the wall" in support of Comey moving to dismiss the charges because of vindictive and selective prosecution, as is the opposition to pursuing an indictment by career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. Under Justice Department policy, prosecutors may pursue indictments only if they believe they can secure a conviction and that conviction will be sustained on appeal.</p><p>"That seasoned and career prosecutors, plus the former U.S. attorney for the EDVA, all said that this indictment doesn't have a legal and factual basis to present to the grand jury, and that [Halligan] was appointed three days before this charge was approved by the grand jury is all ample evidence that something is rotten in Denmark," Rossi said.</p><p>Comey's case is unique compared to others where claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are raised for numerous reasons, Hessick said: It involves people who are newsworthy; there are media reports about the decision to bring charges; Mr. Trump has publicly spoken about action against Comey; and the charges against him appear to involve congressional testimony about investigations into Mr. Trump or Clinton.</p><p>"The case is also notable because this isn't just a question of the motives of the specific prosecutor who brought the charges," she said. "It's also about the president's decisions to speak publicly about a case that's a high-profile political case."</p><p>Hessick said that in previous administrations, presidents are often — but not always — careful not to comment about ongoing cases.</p><p>Mr. Trump sought to have criminal charges brought against him by former special counsel Jack Smith in each of the two cases dismissed for vindictive and selective prosecution, but one of the requests was denied. The two cases, one involving the 2020 election and the other involving Mr. Trump's handling of sensitive government documents after his first term, were <span class="link">dismissed</span> <span class="link">after he won</span> a second term in the White House.</p><p>Hunter Biden, former President Joe Biden's son, also unsuccessfully sought to have his indictment on tax charges dismissed on the same grounds, arguing the investigation into him was "compromised by politics."</p>

<p>Hunter Biden <span class="link">pleaded guilty to the charges</span> last year.</p>

<p>Assata Shakur, a Black Liberation Army member who was convicted of murdering a state trooper in 1973 and lived in Cuba for decades, has died, authorities said Friday. </p><p>Shakur, also known as Joanne Chesimard,  died in Havana "due to health conditions and advanced age" on Thursday, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a news release. </p><p>She was born JoAnne Deborah Byron in Queens, New York, in July 1947, BET News reported. In 1967, she married Louis Chesimard. The pair divorced in 1970. </p>
<p>Shakur was attached to Black nationalist movements, including the Black Panther Party and the Black Liberation Army, which called for armed resistance against systemic racism and planned assassinations of <span class="link">law enforcement members</span> in multiple U.S. cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Atlanta. In 2013, former FBI assistant director <span class="link">John Miller told CBS News</span> that she was "the soul of the Black Liberation Army" and had been a leader of the group. </p><p>She was charged with multiple crimes in the early 1970s, including a bank robbery. In 1973, she was involved in a shootout on the New Jersey Turnpike. The incident left state trooper Werner Foerster and Black Liberation Army member Zayd Malik Shakur dead. Assata Shakur was wounded in the incident. She was arrested and convicted of murdering Foerster, as well as seven other felony charges related to the shooting. She was sentenced to life in prison. </p>
<p>In 1979, Shakur escaped the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey. Miller said the escape, which saw two men smuggled into the prison to take guards hostage and break her out, was "incredibly daring." In 1984, she was smuggled to Mexico, Miller said, then transported to Cuba, where she was granted political asylum by the Castro government. </p>

<p>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and State Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan said in a statement Friday, "For years, we have worked with the State Department to bring Chesimard back to New Jersey, so she could face justice for the cold-blooded murder of an American hero. Sadly, it appears she has passed without being held fully accountable for her heinous crimes."</p><p>Shakur lived openly in Cuba, publishing an autobiography in 1987. Miller said she taught at Cuban universities. In 2013, she was placed on the FBI's Most Wanted terrorist list, becoming the first woman to be added. The reward for her capture was $2 million, but she was <span class="link">largely shielded from extradition</span> to the U.S., Miller said. </p>
<p>Activists saw her as a symbol of resistance to racial injustice and government repression, CBS News previously reported. </p><p>Shakur was the step-aunt and godmother of slain rapper Tupac Shakur.</p>

<p><em>Washington — </em>The Supreme Court on Friday allowed President Trump's administration to <span class="link">withhold more than $4 billion</span> in foreign aid funding, granting its request for emergency relief in a dispute over money that Congress has already approved.</p><p>The high court's decision follows an order that Chief Justice John Roberts had issued earlier this month, which <span class="link">temporarily froze</span> a district court injunction requiring the Trump administration to spend the money Congress appropriated for foreign-aid projects by the end of September. The court appeared to divide 6-3, with Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court's three liberals, dissenting.</p><p>The Supreme Court said in an unsigned order that the harm to the executive branch's ability to conduct foreign affairs appears to outweigh the potential harm faced by the plaintiffs, which are organizations and businesses that receive funding for foreign aid projects. It added that the decision "should not be read as a final determination on the merits. The relief granted by the Court today reflects our preliminary view, consistent with the standards for interim relief."</p><h2>The legal fight over foreign aid</h2><p>The dispute before the justices involves a tranche of more than $4 billion Congress approved last year for overseas development assistance, peacekeeping operations and to promote democracy globally, among other priorities. Mr. Trump <span class="link">notified Congress</span> last month that he is seeking to claw back $4.9 billion before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30 through a maneuver known as a "pocket rescission."</p><p>The Government Accountability Office has said the move is illegal.</p>

<p>But the Supreme Court said in its decision that at this stage in the proceedings, the government "has made a sufficient showing" that the Impoundment Control Act, the mechanism for the president to move to cancel congressionally approved federal funding, precludes the plaintiffs' suit. That lawsuit sought to make the president comply with appropriations law passed last year.</p><p>In a dissenting opinion, Kagan said the stakes in the case are high, as it involves the allocation of power between the executive branch and Congress.</p><p>"[T]he consequence of today's grant is significant. I appreciate that the majority refrains from offering a definitive view of this dispute and the questions raised in it," she wrote. "But the effect of its ruling is to allow the Executive to cease obligating $4 billion in funds that Congress appropriated for foreign aid, and that will now never reach its intended recipients. Because that result conflicts with the separation of powers, I respectfully dissent."</p><p>U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled in early September that the administration's refusal not to spend congressionally approved funds is likely illegal under a federal law governing the agency rule-making process. The judge said the Trump administration could withhold the funding only if Congress rescinded it through duly enacted legislation.</p>

<p>The dispute was brought by nonprofit organizations and development companies in February after the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause of <span class="link">foreign development assistance</span> to review whether programs were consistent with the president's foreign policy. </p><p>It has since ping-ponged <span class="link">through the courts,</span> including the Supreme Court back in March. Then, the high court split 5-4 in deciding to <span class="link">leave in place</span> an order from Ali that required the Trump administration to pay roughly $2 billion in invoices for foreign-aid work that had already been performed.</p><p>In the latest development in the case, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled last month that the nonprofits and businesses could not sue on grounds the administration violated the separation of powers by unilaterally declining to spend congressionally approved foreign-aid funds. The panel voted 2-1 to wipe away an order from Ali that had prohibited the government from withholding the money Congress appropriated last year for foreign assistance programs.</p><p>But the D.C. Circuit panel later issued an amended opinion that opened up an avenue for the nonprofits and businesses to seek relief on different legal grounds. On the heels of that decision, Mr. Trump informed Congress of his plan to rescind the $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding, which he said supported "wasteful" programs that did not align with his "America First" foreign policy agenda.</p><p>The plaintiffs then filed a new request for preliminary relief with Ali, and the judge found that the Trump administration had a duty to comply with Congress's directives by spending the $4 billion by the end of September, when the fiscal year ends.</p><p>The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit to freeze Ali's latest order. After the appeals court declined to do so, the administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene.</p><p>In a filing with the high court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the district court's injunction "raises a grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers."</p>

<p>"The President can hardly speak with one voice in foreign affairs or in dealings with Congress when the district court is forcing the Executive Branch to advocate against its own objectives," Sauer wrote.</p><p>The solicitor general said Ali's injunction "puts the executive branch at war with itself" by requiring it to spend the same $4 billion that the president wants to claw back.</p><p>But lawyers for the plaintiffs said that the government has been obligated to spend the money approved by Congress for specific purposes since at least March 2024. They wrote in a filing that the appropriations legislation enacted by Congress last year remains binding on the executive branch.</p><p>"[T]he upshot of the government's theory is that Congress's signature law meant to control impoundments actually provided the President vast new powers to impound funds, and made it virtually impossible to challenge impoundments in court," the lawyers said. "Congress would not have enacted such a self-defeating statute."</p><p>The plaintiffs warned that allowing the president to withhold the money for foreign assistance would threaten the viability of groups that receive federal dollars for projects overseas. For one of the organizations, Democracy International, 98% of its revenues in 2024 came from awards from the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to court filings. Lawyers warned the company would be at risk of bankruptcy if the expiring appropriations are not spent.</p><p>"The pocket rescission of democracy promotion funds is an existential threat to Democracy International," the plaintiffs wrote.</p>

<section class="content__body">
<p>Two major TV station owners, Sinclair Broadcasting and Nexstar Media Group, announced on Friday that they are returning "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" to their ABC stations, ending the <span class="link">preemption of the late-night show</span> over remarks Kimmel had made following <span class="link">the shooting death</span> of conservative activist <span class="link">Charlie Kirk</span>. </p><p>Sinclair said in a statement Friday afternoon that the show will be back on the air on its ABC affiliates tonight, and a few hours later later, Nexstar announced it's bringing the show back tonight as well. Sinclair owns 38 ABC stations across the U.S. and Nexstar owns 33.</p><p>Disney's ABC <span class="link">brought Kimmel's show back</span> on Tuesday following a six-day suspension, but stations owned by Sinclair and Nexstar — about a quarter of the network's affiliates — had <span class="link">continued to air</span> other programming in that time slot instead.</p><p>"Our objective throughout this process has been to ensure that programming remains accurate and engaging for the widest possible audience," Sinclair said in its statement. "We take seriously our responsibility as local broadcasters to provide programming that serves the interests of our communities, while also honoring our obligations to air national network programming." </p><p>Nexstar said it its statement, "We have had discussions with executives at The Walt Disney Company and appreciate their constructive approach to addressing our concerns. As a local broadcaster, Nexstar remains committed to protecting the First Amendment while producing and airing local and national news that is fact-based and unbiased and, above all, broadcasting content that is in the best interest of the communities we serve."</p>

<p>The show's Tuesday episode, which was inaccessible to viewers in Sinclair and Nexstar-controlled markets, still drew a broadcast audience of <span class="link">about four times larger</span> than average. An estimated 6.26 million people tuned into the broadcast, Disney said in a statement Wednesday, citing numbers compiled by Nielsen, an audience measurement firm. The data does not include viewers who streamed the program online. </p><p>Kimmel's show drew a nightly average of 1.42 million broadcast viewers during its 2024-25 season, a Disney spokesperson told CBS News. </p>
