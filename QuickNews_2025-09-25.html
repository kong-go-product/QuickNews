<div class="article-title">Kamala Harris' book, media tour slammed by liberal critics as 'embarrassing' and 'unhelpful'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris' book and promotion tour have been met with disdain and criticism from fellow Democrats and some members of the media. </p><p>"At a time when people are looking for a vision and leadership... and want to see leaders rise to the level of threat facing the country, it’s pretty crazy she chose to write a gossip book that prioritizes the pettiness of her politics," an advisor to a possible 2028 candidate told Politico. "It’s embarrassing for her, and for all Democrats, considering she was the leader of the party less than a year ago."</p><p>Harris sat down with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on Monday, and ABC's "Good Morning America" and "The View" on Tuesday to discuss her new book, "107 Days," about her short, failed presidential campaign. She was pressed on why she thought she didn't win and on a key interview she did in 2024 where she failed to differentiate herself from former President Joe Biden. </p><p>"Harris’ recent media tour to tout her memoir — ‘107 Days’ — has reminded me of something I think I have long known: She is simply not a very good politician. And she hasn’t gotten much better over her decades in the business," former CNN journalist Chris Cillizza wrote in his Substack.</p><p>In a post to X, Cillizza said Harris’ return to the political world reminded him that she’s not good on her feet, adding, "She speaks in word salads."</p><p>CNN's Kasie Hunt and former Democratic Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel discussed Harris' admission on "The View" that she didn't fully appreciate voters wanted to see a difference between her and Biden. </p><p>"Didn‘t fully appreciate how much of an issue it was? Just the entire ballgame," Hunt said Tuesday, asking Emanuel to react. </p><p>Emanuel said all great presidents have a deep appreciation for politics.</p><p>"To not appreciate that question, given that the people thought at that time that the country was headed — 70% thought it was headed in the wrong direction, they wanted to see a change — is to totally misread where the American people were. And that, I‘m a little shocked at, to be honest," he said. </p><p>Harris told the co-hosts of "The View" she lost to President Donald Trump because she didn't have enough time. </p><p>Emanuel also called out Harris for her reasoning in not picking Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as her running mate. </p><p>The former vice president wrote that Buttigieg was too big of a "risk" as a gay man. </p><p>"We were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man. Part of me wanted to say, ‘Screw it, let’s just do it.’ But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk," she wrote. "And I think Pete also knew that — to our mutual sadness."</p><p>Maddow told Harris her rationale for not picking Buttigieg was "hard to hear," forcing Harris to scramble to explain herself to the MSNBC audience.</p><p>One Democratic strategist told The Hill that Harris' book couldn't have come at a worse time. </p><p>, a California Democratic strategist, told the outlet that excerpts of the book "show pretty clearly that she came out with arms flailing and guns blazing, blaming everyone but herself for her loss."</p><p>"It is a curiously negative and ungracious tome for someone who reportedly thinks she can run again in 2028," he added.  </p><p>"In an era where Democrats need all hands on deck in the fight to protect the country and the Constitution from the lawlessness of the Trump administration, she had a real opportunity to be a critical voice in the resistance," Michael Hardaway, a former senior advisor to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told Politico. "This book seems to be unhelpful and divisive in a way that makes it hard for her to be the face of the party as we look to the future."</p><p>Former Obama advisor David Axelrod criticized the book last week in a statement to Politico.</p><p>"If there’s a political strategy here, it’s a bad one. There’s an awful lot of grievances and finger-pointing that really doesn’t serve a political agenda," he said.</p><p>Harris' office did not immediately return a request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims reminds us of 'soft-on-crime' policies' deadly consequences</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>On Sept. 25, we pause as a nation to honor the National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims. It is a solemn day – a day to reflect on the lives stolen, the families shattered and the communities forever scarred by violent crime. </p><p>But remembrance without action is hollow. If we truly honor victims, we must also face the uncomfortable truth: for too long, policies masquerading as "social justice" advocates have placed criminals above victims, and elections have become quite literally a matter of life and death.</p><p>We warned about this in 2017, when progressive prosecutors funded by George Soros began reshaping justice systems across America under the banner of "reform." They promised fairness. What they delivered was bloodshed. The American people now see the devastating cost of these reckless experiments: families burying loved ones who should still be alive.</p><p>Look no further than Charlotte, North Carolina, when the world witnessed pure horror and the murder of Iryna Zarutska. Or to the tragic murder of Laken Riley, a young nursing student whose promising life was stolen. These names join a long list of victims who paid the price for policies that coddle criminals instead of protecting the innocent.</p><p>We’ve seen the consequences up close. We have worked with grieving families across the country who were robbed not just of their loved ones, but of justice. In New York, we walked alongside Victor Maldonado after the senseless killing of his son, Jonathan. </p><p>Jonathan was a ride-share driver, doing honest work to provide for his family while making sure others returned home safely to theirs. His life was cut short by a repeat drunken driver who had been arrested multiple times, and released again and again under bail reform, even after he tampered with his monitoring device. Despite every warning sign, the system let him walk free – and Jonathan paid with his life just days after New York’s bail reform took effect.</p><p>Jonathan’s story is not unique. It’s part of a disturbing pattern. From coast to coast, families are suffering because politicians chose ideology over safety. They gamble with public security by dismantling accountability, emptying jails and excusing repeat offenders. Every release, every "second chance" given to a predator is another victim waiting to happen.</p><p>Some of the victims and families we work with have been in this fight for over 40 years. Take Barbara Connelly, executive director of Long Island NY Metro Area Parents and Other Survivors of Murdered Victims Outreach support group, for example. </p><p>Barbara became a pioneer in the victims’ rights movement after her 15-year-old son, Jimmy, was murdered. His killer was released not only from prison, but also from parole supervision. Can you imagine? Someone can murder a child in cold blood and then one day walk free, living life as though nothing happened – while a mother like Barbara is left to pick up the pieces. </p><p>Barbara buried her baby and then had to fight for the most basic rights, rights anyone with common sense would assume victims already had. And now, after decades of progress, Barbara finds herself fighting the same fight all over again.</p><p>What makes this moment even sadder is the depraved indifference toward human life that has infected our society. People actually take to the streets to protest for the release of cold-blooded killers like Luigi Mangione. We see crowds rallying not for victims, not for grieving families, but for terrorists, rapists and murderers – even cheering on organizations like Hamas. </p><p>How did we lose our way so badly that evil is celebrated while innocence is forgotten? This moral inversion is tearing at the soul of our nation.</p><p>Now as a nation, we are grieving together once again. We are watching in real time the agony of Erika Kirk after witnessing the assassination of her husband, Charlie Kirk. She is not alone in her grief. Millions of Americans who have followed Charlie’s work feel this loss deeply, because we know it didn’t have to happen. The pain of his family is now a national wound, and it underscores with horrifying clarity the price we all pay when society refuses to take evil seriously.</p><p>President Donald Trump has been one of the few leaders willing to call this crisis what it is: a preventable tragedy caused by failed policies. He has shown a commitment to stopping the bloodshed with the most basic, commonsense principle: lock up the bad guys. Secure communities start with accountability. Justice cannot exist if criminals know they will face no real consequences.</p><p>To Congress, to state legislatures and to every governor in America: victims and survivors are pleading with you. Adopt our agenda built not on ideology, but on the lived experiences of families who have buried their loved ones. We are not speaking from theory – we are speaking from the gravesides of our children, spouses and parents. Survivors of homicide victims know the cost of failure, and we know what must be done.</p><p>I know this pain personally. In 2005, my boyfriend and his best friend were murdered. They did not receive the justice they deserved, and that wound has never healed. Decades later, every time I hear about another senseless murder, another family joining this unwanted fraternity of grief, I am taken back to that cold January of loss and heartbreak. The pain is compounded when I learn that the killer was someone the government chose to release – someone who should have been behind bars.</p><p>That is why this day matters. The National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims must be more than symbolic. It must be a turning point. We owe it to Iryna Zarutska, to Laken Riley, to Jonathan Maldonado, to Barbara Connelly’s Jimmy, to Charlie Kirk, and to every victim whose name has been etched into a headstone too soon. We owe it to their families, who will never be the same.</p><p>It is time to choose victims over criminals. It is time to listen to survivors. It is time to reject the failed social experiments that have turned our cities into danger zones. And it is time for leaders at every level to follow President Trump’s lead and take the commonsense step that could save countless lives: lock up the predators and protect the innocent.</p><p>Because remembrance means nothing if we keep repeating the same mistakes.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">MORNING GLORY: 'Do you like Trump?'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Bobby was assigned to guide me around Connecticut this past week. He’s a former police officer who now takes care of guests of my radio station affiliates in the Nutmeg State who don’t know the area. He’s a very smart veteran of the Air Force and police forces. </p><p>When Bobby recognized me as the fellow with whom then-candidate Donald Trump was not altogether happy during the four debates in which 45-47 participated in 2015-2016 when I was among the journalists asking questions, I got from Bobby the question in the headline and spontaneously gave the answer in the subheadline. I had not used that answer before. But it’s wholly true and accurate for me. </p><p>Not surprisingly, the next question after "Yes" was "Why?" To which I responded without much thought: "Because he’s an ‘A-to-B’ guy and we need a lot more of that."</p><p>I don’t care for some of the Trump policies, personnel and decisions over the years, but give standing ovations for others. He’s so much better a choice for the Oval Office than either Secretary Hillary Clinton, former President Joe Biden or former Vice President Kamala Harris. I don’t really have to explain my three votes for him. </p><p>But, when I confess that I’ve grown to "like" him to a stranger, it’s fair for the stranger to ask "Why?" My answer this week is the quick summation I’ll use going forward. </p><p>I don’t think Bobby, or anyone else in casual conversation, wants to hear why the president’s defense rebuild, especially of the U.S. Navy, is absolutely critical to the long-term safety of the country; why Operation Midnight Hammer saved the world from the nightmare of a nuclear Iran; why his demand that "elite" education stop violating the country’s civil rights laws when it comes to admissions and protect its Jewish students on campus is just and necessary; how his appointees to the Supreme Court and lower federal courts saved the Constitution from mauling by ultra-progressives in robes; the One Big Beautiful Bill, a closed border etc. etc. etc. The list of excellent policies is long, as is the list of excellent appointees. I have my list of disagreements about policy and people. It’s much shorter. </p><p>What most people want when they ask about President Trump and if their interest is genuine, as opposed to the bell that is intended to open a fight, is a concise explanation of my votes and my affection for 45-47, one that isn’t wonky or a diversion and my spontaneous answer has improved in my mind the more I think of it. </p><p>When I practiced law, I represented large developers who had enormous projects covering sometimes tens of thousands of acres. Whether individual entrepreneurs like Trump or corporate entities, the decision makers in the world of land development were all "A-to-B" guys and gals. They had a project, time was money and they needed to get from where they were on the "critical path" to the end point of selling homes, commercial office spaces or industrial sites. </p><p>Lawyers were hardly welcome on those journeys, but often necessary and when the obstacle in the way was a federal or state law or regulation having to do with "endangered species," "wetlands," or a few other categories of hurdles to be crossed, the phone would ring. The client didn’t care about my family, my firm, my faith or my health. Could I get their project from point A to B? </p><p>And that is an "A-to-B" guy or gal: A problem solver. President Trump sees problems and he wants to take the most direct path to solve them within the Constitutional order. </p><p>(He always obeys court orders and has often reaffirmed his intent to always do so. Thus talk of dictatorship and authoritarianism is absurd. Those who use such ridiculous descriptions should lose the respect of serious people. If you submit to the law — and boy did the president ever do that throughout the lawfare years in front of courts that are only charitably described as "kangaroo" in some cases — then you are a "rule of law" person, not a dictator or authoritarian.)</p><p>But Trump is direct, always and everywhere. He tells you exactly what he thinks. He changes his mind and then tells you what he thinks now. He identifies what he thinks are solutions and pursues them in linear fashion. If something doesn’t work, he looks for the next best direct line to a solution. He doesn’t stop trying. "A-to-B" again and again. </p><p>There is only one "A," which is where America is right now. There are a host of "Bs," which are all the problems Trump sees bedeviling America in one way or another, from Xi and Putin, to Gaza, to high interest rates, to the need for manufacturing of all sorts to reshore.  </p><p>He is always in the "most direct possible solution" business, until that possible solution becomes impossible. Then he finds the next "B" to pursue in that space. </p><p>I’ve grown to like this approach immensely because it is public. Everybody sees it. Everyone who wants to listen will hear it explained.  </p><p>The president has always been the best interview of my lifetime in broadcast because he answers every question and, if you ask a stupid question, he will tell you that too. Accessibility? There’s never been a president to whom the public had more access. I think he is this way, by the way, because all developers who succeed have to answer questions from the most extraordinary range of people of various levels of talent if they want to get to "B" and see their project completed.</p><p>All successful developers are fundamentally alike. All of them take big swings and have some misses. But the ones who succeed? They are all "A-to-B" people. </p><p>So that’s why I like Trump. I have a priest and a pastor. I don’t need those in a president. I think the Constitution as amended and interpreted is a work of genius that needs respecting and President Trump does, though he’s not shy about having his lawyers test old precedents ("Humphrey’s Executor" or the "Chevron doctrine" come to mind) that may need tossing out by the Supreme Court. He’s full of an energy and resilience that the entire country, even his political enemies, feed off of.</p><p>And he scares our enemies, or at least causes them to hesitate in their malign designs. </p><p>The GOP has a great young bench that Trump has helped build up: Vice President JD Vance, Secretaries Rubio and Heseth, Senators Cotton and Cruz, Representative Stefanik. He gets along with GOP leaders with independent sources of power like Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader Thune and smart governors like Ron DeSantis in Florida and Glenn Youngkin in Virginia. The Democrats are in disarray and plunging off the hard left cliff like lemmings. Trump has seized the political center and is holding it tenaciously with focus on issues of the physical security of the citizenry, the safety of their children and economic growth for everyone. </p><p>He’s an "A-to-B" guy and Americans generally like that.</p><p>Trump is far more "TR" than "RR" or "HW" in temperament, but for this time and the next three years, we very much need an A-to-B guy who will accept losing rounds in the courts. It is sometimes that simple. </p><p><i>Hugh Hewitt is host of "The Hugh Hewitt Show," heard weekday mornings 6am to 9am ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

<div class="article-title">America’s breaking point: Why 2026 could bury Democrats for a generation</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>We are at a crossroads. A grieving nation demands answers, yet Democrats stand defiantly with chaos. As the adage reminds us, actions have consequences. The 2026 elections and beyond will be a reckoning for the Democratic Party, already on the wrong side of America. On every major issue, from crime to immigration to cultural disconnect, Democrats' embrace of far-left radicalism is alienating voters and paving the way for another crushing defeat. Public fear of crime continues to surge, yet Democrats deny and dismiss voters’ concerns, cementing their status as a permanent minority party, out of touch, indifferent and forgetful of whom they were elected to serve. Their downfall is evident.</p><p>Very few Democrats have the courage to confront reality, but Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) does. He sees that his party’s denial of America’s concerns is unsustainable and is sounding the alarm to change course. This month he warned that Democrats have "forgotten why we lost" in 2024, urging them to stop demonizing President Donald Trump with reckless comparisons to Hitler and to turn down the temperature by acknowledging the political landscape. Fetterman has frequently criticized Democrats for labeling Trump an autocrat, refusing to learn from electoral defeats and failing to connect with the American people. His message is clear: swing-state voters do not want defunded police, open borders, or culture crusades. They want common sense, safety, security and leaders who respect their values. Yet Democrats refuse to listen to Fetterman, or to the American majority, clinging instead to progressive extremism that prizes activism over governance.</p><p>The denial of the Democratic Party is on full display as Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY), a self-proclaimed moderate, chose extremism. Her recent endorsement of Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor has sparked outrage. Mamdani, a radical socialist, built his entire platform on defunding the police, abolishing ICE and protecting sanctuary cities. He represents exactly what voters reject. Hochul tried to justify her endorsement as politically strategic, but there is nothing strategic about betraying American safety for political expediency. The days of moderation are gone. You are either with America, safety and security — or with radicalism. Hochul chose radicalism. And that choice tells voters everything they need to know about where the Democratic Party stands.</p><p>The consequences are devastating and undeniable. In Dallas, Texas, Chandra Mouli Nagamallaiah, an Indian hotel manager, was brutally beheaded last week by an illegal Cuban immigrant. What do Hochul, Mamdani and their Democratic allies say to his family about sanctuary cities? How do they justify policies that shield criminals while leaving innocent Americans like Chandra vulnerable? Sanctuary for whom? It is a fraud when the cost is American life. And these tragedies are not isolated. Polling shows immigration is a dominant voter priority, with the link to crime fueling overwhelming support for aggressive enforcement. Eighty-one percent of Americans view crime as a major concern and Trump’s tough-on-crime stance continues to gain traction. Yet Democrats ignore the crisis. Safety is not optional — without it, America cannot function as a society.</p><p>As Democrats remain tone-deaf to the cries of the American people, their coalition is collapsing. Fractured by radicalism, the Democratic base is eroding, with working-class Black and Hispanic voters leading the shift. Trump’s 2024 victory was propelled by these voters, where he gained 12 points among Black voters and a 25-point swing with Hispanics — driven by frustration over crime and economic strain tied to unchecked illegal immigration. These are the Americans who suffer most from urban crime and face the economic burden of sanctuary policies that cost taxpayers billions in health care, education and policing — resources desperately needed in unsafe neighborhoods. Sanctuary cities are draining the foundation of the communities Democrats claim to represent. The cultural war is causing further damage. The defund-the-police agenda and its failed execution have fueled rising crime, unsafe schools and alienated parents who demand protection for their children. Democrats’ obsession with equity over enforcement has backfired, deepening inequality in vulnerable neighborhoods.</p><p>If Democrats want to ignore the will of the American people, they should look to history as a warning about their party’s future. In the 1980s, Democrats hemorrhaged voter support over high crime rates because of their soft-on-crime policies. Fearful Americans chose the Republican Party, which championed law and order, stronger policing and tougher penalties to restore public safety. Democrats also lost voters who were discontent with economic stagnation, inflation and cultural weakness. This lost ground let Republicans dominate for a decade. Today, political violence is escalating and amplified by left-wing policies that allow lawlessness and chaos. If Democrats refuse to change course, 2026 will be the defining moment that locks them into minority status for a generation while Republicans stand with Americans who demand safety, order and stability.</p><p>The choice could not be clearer. Forget the politics and address the needs of the American people: deliver safety or face the consequences. Democrats must tone down the rhetoric and prioritize the gold standard — law enforcement, secure borders and common-sense solutions. Their refusal to change course is not an accident, it is a choice. And the 2026 midterms will be the turning point.</p><p> There has never been greater clarity. America faces two paths: stand with law, order and core principles — or stand with chaos and radicalism. Voters are watching. 2026 will be remembered as the year Americans stood up, chose security and began the revival of their future.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">From AOC to Zohran Mamdani, the Democrats are peddling far-left politics</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Democrats have a huge political opening.</p><p>With President Trump under fire from all directions — including some in his own party — it’s a rare chance for the opposition to put some points on the board.</p><p>And who are the most prominent Dems right now?</p><p>One is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>The other is Zohran Mamdani.</p><p>AOC is uber-liberal, and the New York mayoral candidate is a self-proclaimed democratic socialist.</p><p>Many party office-holders, not to mention media and political analysts, say the Democrats’ biggest problem is having lurched too far to the left. A fixation on pronouns, transgender sports and Palestinian rights. </p><p>Does that sound like where most of America is in the fall of 2025?</p><p>There are plenty of clickbait headlines out there about AOC weighing a presidential race. But what Axios’ Alex Thompson, who had the scoop, actually reported is that she’s considering a White House run or a Senate race, against Chuck Schumer. So not much has changed.</p><p>AOC, now in her fourth term, just barely meets the constitutional requirement that a president be at least 35.</p><p>But there’s no question that she’s a dynamic campaigner, prodigious fundraiser and social media phenomenon, with an aura of authenticity.</p><p>Even Trump told Fox News, "She’s got a little spunk, she’s got a little something." But, he said, "her philosophy is bad for the country. I don’t think that philosophy can come close to winning."</p><p>It’s true that what plays in her Queens-Bronx district doesn’t necessarily play in Peoria. I think she would beat Schumer, an establishment figure who seems to read all his statements, but even in the state there are plenty of conservative regions between the Bronx and Buffalo. </p><p>On the House floor, the congresswoman condemned Charlie Kirk’s murder, but said:</p><p>"We should be clear about who Charlie Kirk was: a man who believed that the Civil Rights Act that granted Black Americans the right to vote was a mistake, who, after the violent attack on Paul Pelosi, claimed that ‘some amazing patriot' should bail out his brutal assailant, and accused Jews of controlling ‘not just the colleges — it’s the nonprofits, it’s the movies, it’s Hollywood, it’s all of it."</p><p>She added: "His rhetoric and beliefs were ignorant, uneducated and sought to disenfranchise millions of Americans." </p><p>So she wouldn’t even vote for a symbolic resolution honoring Kirk, the 31-year-old victim of a targeted assassination. That sort of rhetoric excites her base but isn’t exactly a step toward unity.</p><p>Mamdani, who is very likely to become mayor, has a history of socialist rhetoric that he’s trying to soften without retracting it. The inexperienced assemblyman clung to "Globalize the Intifada" — meaning, wipe out Israel — but now says he can see how it’s misinterpreted and won’t encourage its use. He insists that as mayor he would have Bibi Netanyau arrested if he came to the U.N.  </p><p>And this isn’t ancient history. In 2022, he wrote on his website: "We need to dramatically curtail the power and presence of the N.Y.P.D.," cut the force by 1,300 officers through attrition, and cut police overtime and freeze hiring.</p><p>Why? "A racist police system" aimed at controlling "Black &amp; brown New Yorkers."</p><p>Andrew Cuomo, who has been visiting mosques and churches, has turned much more aggressive, calling Mamdani "a man with no beliefs" and "a hypocritical chameleon desperate for attention and adulation." But, of course, Cuomo was forced to resign as governor. No one remembers that he pledged to drop out of the race unless he was leading Mamdani by September. </p><p>The democratic socialist has a double-digit lead, which is why Gov. Kathy Hochul endorsed him — she saw the train leaving the station. That prompted a swipe by President Trump, who regularly denounces Mamdani — which might not be helpful in New York City — said he’d have to look closely at federal money going to the Apple.</p><p>Trump already intervened in the mayor’s race by dropping an indictment against Mayor Eric Adams, though he failed to lure him out of the race with offers of an administration job.</p><p>AOC initially declined the back the long-shot Mamdani, the New York Times reports, but when he got hot she endorsed him as having the best chance to beat Cuomo.</p><p>The Republicans would like nothing better than to run against Instagram star AOC and Mayor Mamdani as the face of a hyper-liberal party.</p><p>And then there’s Kamala Harris, who’s out peddling her bridge-burning book "107 Days," starting with a Rachel Maddow sit down. I don’t think she could have beaten Trump in 1,000 days. Harris was a terrible candidate — cautious, risk-averse, hiding from the press for a month, unable to separate from Joe Biden.</p><p>I assume she has the self-awareness to realize another run for the White House would damage her further. The book takes shots at Biden ("reckless" to run again), Pete Buttigieg (couldn’t pick a gay guy), Josh Shapiro (wanted too much power), and Tim Walz (blew the veep debate). Some have clapped back, often through surrogates (Biden folks calling her a lousy VP).  </p><p>To bring things full circle, Harris just endorsed Mamdani. But Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries have not, undoubtedly for fear of being tied to whatever he does.</p><p>There are, of course, whole swaths of the country that want nothing to do with socialism or the far left.</p><p>Kamala Harris’ book focuses attention on the past just when the Democrats are desperate to turn the page.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is telling federal agencies to draw up reduction-in-force (RIF) plans ahead of a possible government shutdown on Oct. 1, according to an internal memo obtained by Fox News. </p><p>The guidance says agencies must consider issuing RIF notices to employees working on programs that are not legally required to continue if funding lapses.</p><p>"With respect to those Federal programs whose funding would lapse and which are otherwise unfunded, such programs are no longer statutorily required to be carried out," the memo states.</p><p>Under the guidance, RIF notices would be issued on top of furlough notices and should go to all employees tied to the affected programs.</p><p>Agencies would later revise those plans once Congress approves fiscal year 2026 appropriations, keeping only the staff needed for core statutory functions.</p><p>The memo notes that while Congress has usually passed short-term funding bills on a bipartisan basis, they believe this year is different. </p><p>The same memo accuses Democrats of breaking that trend and pushing for "insane demands, including $1 trillion in new spending," which it says could force a shutdown.</p><p>Last week, the House passed H.R. 5371, described as a clean continuing resolution (CR) that would extend current funding through Nov. 21.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>At Dearborn, Michigan’s first city council meeting since his clash with a local Christian minister went viral after a heated exchange over a controversial honorary street sign naming, Mayor Abdullah Hammoud declined to apologize for his saying the minister was "not welcome here" and that he would "launch a parade" when he left town. </p><p>Ted Barham, the same Christian minister, opened his remarks at Tuesday's meeting by repeating the words that went viral at the previous one on Sept. 9. </p><p>"The mayor, in a way, cursed me, as was seen around the world. And I would like to repeat what I said that day to you, Mr. Mayor: ‘God bless you,’" Barham said.</p><p>Barham said he had no plans to file a lawsuit despite pressure from supporters.</p><p>"People have been saying I should do that all over the world. I have no intention of doing that," Barham said. </p><p>Instead, he urged the council to consider his larger message: "Bless those who curse you… love your haters. And I would say that in regard to Hezbollah as well. I would [say] that in regard to Mr. Siblani and I would [say] to Israel, too. ‘Love your haters.’"</p><p>He then made a new appeal. </p><p>"Would it be possible for you, Mayor Hammoud, in front of the world and council members to join me in saying we would like to put out a Christian call to prayer and a Christian call to faith in all the countries around the world where an Islamic call to prayer goes out?"</p><p>Others took the microphone to press the council more directly.</p><p>Anthony Deegan told the chamber, "We love you with the love of Christ. We want the blessings of God to be in your life… it’s not a matter of us versus them." But he then asked pointedly: "Do you definitively, unequivocally, by name, denounce Hamas and Hezbollah? Or do you support them?"</p><p>Shane Rife of Garden City said he was "shocked" to learn that Hammoud had appeared at a rally where Arab American News publisher Osama Siblani praised Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as a "hero." </p><p>"We have a mayor in the United States who is sharing a platform with somebody, with [a] terrorist!?" Rife asked. "Where is your allegiance? Is your allegiance to the United States or is your allegiance to Hezbollah?"</p><p>Pastor Jeff Davis of Dearborn Evangelical Covenant Church also voiced support for Barham, stressing his long service in the city.</p><p>Nagi Almudhegi, a Yemeni-American engineer and candidate for mayor, also weighed in during an interview with Fox News Digital. </p><p>"The United States of America is built on the principles of freedom of speech and freedom of religion. These two principles are sacrosanct," Almudhegi said. "If I were in Mayor Abdullah Hamoud’s spot at that time, I would have not said anything. The gentleman has a right, as an American citizen, to speak his mind. And he did it in a respectful, calm way. The mayor should have afforded him that opportunity instead of launching into that tirade."</p><p>He warned that Hammoud’s "not welcome here" remark risked fueling a false impression that Christians are not accepted in Dearborn. </p><p>"People would get the impression, or it would feed into the paranoia that is very, very wrong, that Dearborn is a racist place, or there’s no place for Christians. And that is what I’m 100% against," Almudhegi said.</p><p>Almudhegi had previously released an official statement condemning Hammoud’s remarks as "uncalled for, classless, unprofessional and just plain wrong," and voiced support for Barham.</p><p>When Hammoud spoke later in the evening at the meeting, he did not answer the many calls for an apology or the demand for a specific denunciation. Instead, he said, Dearborn "represents the best of America" where "people of all backgrounds, of all faiths, and of all beliefs can live peacefully and respectfully as neighbors."</p><p>"For decades, people have been intent on dividing and disparaging our city," Hammoud said. "Dearborn has never fallen for these divisive attempts. Back then and still now, Dearborn residents from every corner of this city have come together to shun hatred and to root it out of the place that we’re all proud to call home."</p><p>The controversy continues to loom over Dearborn’s November mayoral election, where Hammoud faces Almudhegi. </p><p>With only two names on the ballot, the clash over religious freedom and free speech sparked by Barham’s remarks and the mayor’s response may become the defining issue for voters.</p><p>Hammoud's office did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Violet Affleck took the stage at the United Nations (U.N.) to demand clean air and as her father, Hollywood star Ben Affleck, wrestles with his smoking habit.</p><p>Wearing a KN95 mask, the 19-year-old Yale freshman addressed the "Healthy Indoor Air: A Global Call to Action" panel Tuesday in New York.</p><p>Over four minutes, Violet urged governments to bring back mask mandates, invest in clean-air infrastructure and recognize "filtered air as a human right as intuitively as we do filtered water."</p><p>"We can create clean air infrastructure that is so ubiquitous and so obviously necessary so that tomorrow’s children don’t even know why we need it," Violet warned delegates.</p><p>But one expert with prior connections to Violet’s famous father suggested her clean-air push could be complicated by his smoking.</p><p>"Violet will never be happy with the air, and she's a very sensitive girl," Rocky Rosen, a Los Angeles smoking cessation trainer, told Fox News Digital. "She wants clean air but also wants dad to be healthy. Violet feels powerless over her father getting off cigarettes."</p><p>Violet is the eldest daughter of Affleck, 53, and his ex-wife, actress Jennifer Garner, 53. The couple, who divorced in 2018 after more than a decade together, also share Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12.</p><p>Affleck has reportedly wrestled with nicotine addiction for decades, even as Violet campaigns for healthier air. </p><p>He's been photographed smoking in public, including one instance where he pulled down his mask at the height of the pandemic just to light up.</p><p>"Smokers like Ben are afraid of two things. He's probably afraid he can't stop. He's probably afraid that he will stop," Rosen said. "Ben's very environmentally concerned but, as far as the cigarettes, they just have control over him."</p><p>Rosen emphasized the actor does try to be careful around others. </p><p>"Her dad doesn't smoke near her. I’m sure, as in the pictures you’ll see of him smoking, he’s by himself. So he’s considerate about the air around him when he’s smoking and doesn't want anybody exposed to his secondhand smoke," he added.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to the Affleck family for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Vice President JD Vance dismissed former MSNBC host Joy Reid’s fiery tirade against his credentials with a goofy meme on Wednesday.</p><p>Reid, who was fired from MSNBC in February, went viral for comments about Vance during an interview with former CNN anchor Don Lemon. </p><p>After saying that she mourns the way Charlie Kirk died, she went on to criticize his rhetoric about affirmative action and how it applies to women like Reid, former first lady Michelle Obama, former congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Reid argued that affirmative action has been used to empower "mediocre" White men like Vance. </p><p>Reid blasted the empowerment of "White people who are essentially mediocre in scale compared to a Black person," suggesting, "maybe the way that JD Vance got into Yale is because they were tired of just letting in White men from New York, from all the elite schools, and they wanted an Appalachian White. That's how that man got into Yale, I promise you."</p><p>Reid has frequently gone on tirades against White people, White men in particular. She recently described American icon Elvis Presley as a mediocre White man.</p><p>Talking to Lemon, Reid argued diversity initiatives bring in people of all backgrounds, such as "disabled people, military veterans, people who come from Appalachia, White folks who come from Alaska and different places that they don't normally come from."</p><p>She cited herself as a beneficiary of affirmative action and suggested her right-wing critics should be thankful to God for the privilege of knowing who she is.</p><p>"Right-wingers, you have the ability to know who I am when I don't know who most of y'all are, but you know me because affirmative action brought me your way," she said. "Tell the Lord, ‘Thank you.’ Be grateful for all that God has given you. God knows what God is doing. She a smart, smart lady."</p><p>"She probably Black," Lemon said.</p><p>"And she definitely Black," Reid responded.</p><p>Vance responded to a post sharing the clip with an image of himself, appearing to mock Reid’s commentary.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>During one of the first Turning Point USA events since Charlie Kirk’s assassination, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin shared a message of hope and faith, telling students, "All of you are the next Charlie Kirk."</p><p>Addressing a packed auditorium at Virginia Tech University as part of the second "This is The Turning Point Tour" stop since Kirk’s death, Youngkin told students, "You will carry the baton. You will engage. You will change minds. You will be that revival."</p><p>Addressing the future, Youngkin said, "The truth is that the question that has been asked over and over again is, ‘Who will be the next Charlie?’ And as I look out in this room and I see thousands of you, I want to repeat the best answer that I have heard. You will be the next Charlie, all of you."</p><p>Despite Kirk’s murder at a similar event at Utah Valley University, Youngkin said the 31-year-old conservative leader left a "blueprint" to advance the truth in the face of evil.</p><p>"That morning Charlie left us with a blueprint," he said. "That morning, he left us with guidelines to once again benefit from a man who spoke truth. He left us again with something to reflect on our own lives. And therefore, tonight we have an opportunity to reflect, and we have an opportunity to go."</p><p>Recalling Kirk’s staunch Christian faith, Youngkin told the students in the arena, "Each one of you is the light. A light that shines in the corner of the room, a light that shines brightly on evil. A light that chases out darkness that is each and every one of you."</p><p>"A sniper's bullet shot from a gun held by someone with a heart of evil tried to silence truth, tried to silence all of us. But you see, the exact opposite is happening," he said. "There is a revival spreading across this great nation."</p><p>"One of the things that we all loved about Charlie Kirk is he not only spoke truth, but he challenged us. He challenged us to do more than sit on the sidelines. He challenged us to engage, to engage in thoughtful dialog, of course, recognizing we had to do it with respect, but to fully engage. Don't back down from your beliefs."</p><p>Youngkin also praised Kirk’s wife, Erika Kirk, who since his death has taken up the role of Turning Point USA CEO, leading the crowd in a moment of applause for her and saying, "We see that the next leader of Turning Point is the person who knew Charlie the very best, someone who looked into his heart."</p><p>Youngkin's words come as Virginia is in the midst of a highly contentious gubernatorial race between Republican Lieutenant Gov. Winsome Sears and former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger. </p><p>On Monday, more than 2,000 people packed into an auditorium at the University of Minnesota for the first Turning Point USA event in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s assassination. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lamented missed opportunities for the Democratic Party in reaching young, male voters in 2024 when pressed Wednesday on how Democrats should move forward.</p><p>"Why have Democrats lost? Not only the working-class White men, but working-class Black men, Latinos, go down the list. Young men, so many others. What’s gone wrong? What do the Democrats need to do moving forward to set things straight?" MSNBC host Joe Scarborough asked Clinton during "Morning Joe."</p><p>Clinton said there were many reasons, but she argued the Republican Party did a better job dominating the social media space.</p><p>Clinton responded, "It probably boils down to candidates on the Democratic side either stopped talking in ways that were going to be understood and appreciated and agreed with by certain constituencies, stopped being effective communicators in modern communications. You know, the Republican Party, I have to say, has done a much better job dominating social media, dominating the podcast ecosystem, getting messages out and aiming, particularly at young men."</p><p>Clinton said the Republican Party's efforts to reach men online and engage with them were successful, crediting Steve Bannon and the GOP's outreach. </p><p>"I think Democrats missed a lot of opportunities on that. There seems to be a concerted effort to try to catch up and repair that," she said. </p><p>The former Democratic presidential candidate also said many people get their news from social media, and Democrats needed to capitalize on the space.</p><p>"If they’re getting their news from 15-second videos, 30-second takes, 3-hour podcasts, where people are just kind of unplugged and saying whatever, then Democrats had better compete in those arenas. And, so, there’s a lot of catch-up work to be done," she said. </p><p>Clinton added that Americans did not feel like they were better off in the last election. </p><p>"They did not feel that, fairly or unfairly, the policies of the Biden administration were helping them, helping their families, and Latino voters felt that, as you say, both Latino men, Black men and others said, ‘OK, well, how bad can it get? I mean, you know, we’re not going to want to continue this. So, we have to try something different,'" Clinton added. </p><p>She went on to criticize President Donald Trump's policies and said, "Reality is going to bite."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> In the wake of Charlie Kirk's Sept. 10 assassination allegedly at the hands of a left-wing ideologue, a leftist gun club with ties to political violence posted recruiting flyers at Georgetown University with references to Kirk's death. </p><p>"Hey fascist! Catch!" says a red flyer from the John Brown Gun Club posted on Georgetown's campus. </p><p>The phrase is a nod to the same slogan which was allegedly written on a shell casing by Tyler Robinson, who stands accused of murdering Kirk at a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University. </p><p>"The only political group that celebrates when Nazis die," the advertisement says. </p><p>It is adorned with a QR code linking to a page that says, "We're building a community that's done with ceremonial resistance and strongly worded letters. If you want to make a real change in your community, let us know below."Turning Point USA spokesman and Charlie Kirk Show executive producer Andrew Kolvet flagged the flyers in a social media post Wednesday afternoon. </p><p>Shae McInnis, a sophomore at Georgetown University and treasurer of the school's College Republicans Club, found the posters in plain sight on the school's activity board on Wednesday morning. </p><p>"So, obviously I read this immediately as a threat, not only for me but for everyone on this campus," McInnis told Fox News Digital. "Every conservative, everyone who just does not subscribe to the prevailing leftist orthodoxy. This is a direct threat against them. It means that there are students at this campus who want to see conservatives dead rather than engaging with their ideas, rather than facilitating a political discourse." </p><p>"Ever since President Trump won the election in January, we've seen an increase in this rhetoric," he continued. "But really, I think many conservatives noticed a change after Charlie Kirk's assassination. While much of the school was united in condemning this horrible act of political violence, there have been fringe elements on the left on social media that we have seen really defend this, justify this, and that is really unacceptable. </p><p>The Center for Counter Extremism lists the John Brown Gun Club as a "far-left group." </p><p>Members of the organization frequently show up armed at left-wing political events under the guise of protecting protesters from right-wing counter-protesters, and the gun club is tied to recent anti-ICE violence. </p><p>On July 4, a dozen people attacked the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas. </p><p>A criminal complaint filed by the U.S. District Court Northern District of Texas alleges that assailants shot 20 to 30 rounds from an AR-15-style rifle before it jammed, causing it to malfunction. </p><p>Some of the suspects in that case are accused of setting off fireworks and graffiting ICE vehicles with slogans like "ICE Pig" in order to lure unarmed agents into a parking lot. At around the same time, more suspects allegedly opened fire from a nearby tree line, striking a local police officer and injuring him. </p><p>Eleven suspects face federal charges, including three counts of attempted murder of federal agents in addition to three counts of discharging a firearm in relation to a crime of violence.</p><p>One of those suspects is Benjamin Song, a long-time antifa agitator who in 2023 was involved in a skirmish with a right-wing group called the New Columbia Movement during a drag event in Fort Worth. </p><p>A lawsuit filed by the New Columbia Movement says Song was at the event providing security as a member of the John Brown Gun Club's Elm Fork Chapter. He was accused of pepper spraying members of the group, but never charged criminally. </p><p>The club has chapters nationwide, and another member, Willem van Spronsen, was killed by authorities in 2019 when he tried to blow up an ICE detention center by igniting a propane tank and throwing Molotov cocktails at the building. </p><p>"You know, we're totally comfortable with the fact that many people disagree with us, and that's what a university is supposed to do," said McInnis. "It's supposed to sharpen ideas based on what people disagree with. But it's not until I saw this poster early this morning that I ever felt directly threatened. I mean, this poster is directly calling for the death of conservatives on this campus." </p><p>The club is named for militant slave abolitionist John Brown, who in 1856 orchestrated the Pottawatomie Massacre. He and fellow abolitionists dragged five Kansas settlers suspected of having pro-slavery sympathies out of their homes and executed them. </p><p>In October 1859, Brown led a 21-man raid on a federal armory in Harper's Ferry, part of Virginia at the time. His goal was to start a slave uprising, but few slaves joined the fight. A local militia confronted Brown and his men and fought back. Four townspeople, including freed slave Heyward Shepherd, were caught in the crossfire and killed in the skirmish.  </p><p>After 10 of his men were killed, Brown was captured. He was later tried for treason and eventually hanged. </p><p>"Georgetown University has no tolerance for calls for violence or threats to the university," a spokesperson for the school told Fox News Digital. "The flyers have been removed and the university is investigating this incident and working to ensure the safety of our community."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">UNC faces lawsuit over alleged pattern of closed-door meetings, including Bill Belichick hire</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A lawsuit accuses the University of North Carolina and its board of trustees of illegally hiring head football coach Bill Belichick behind closed doors in December. </p><p>Former UNC Provost Chris Clemens and lawyer David McKenzie filed the lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court, and it alleges Belichick’s hiring is one of many instances in which closed sessions occurred at the public university.</p><p>The lawsuit points to an alleged "pattern and practice" at UNC to conceal "matters of grave public concern behind closed doors." One of those matters includes potential conference realignment.</p><p>Clemens also alleges that he was punished after "leaking closed-session information" to faculty members about a meeting with tenure deferral as the main topic of the lawsuit. </p><p>"As Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost, [Clemens] briefed deans and vice chancellors internally about the Board’s tenure policy posture after a closed session so they could manage faculty expectations," the lawsuit reads. </p><p>"The Board’s subsequent effort to punish him for ‘leaking’ closed-session information only highlights the culture of secrecy at odds with the Open Meetings Law and Public Records Law."</p><p>As for Belichick’s hiring, the lawsuit alleges that "substantive deliberation occurred in secret" on Dec. 12, 2024, in an emergency board meeting. The lawsuit charges that, since Belichick’s "compensation package and entire hiring was already public," there was no need for the closed session. </p><p>"The Board did not present any comparable thirty-year ‘net present cost’ analysis, nor did it invoke long-horizon fiscal restraint to defer that decision for a single UNC employee," the lawsuit states, spelling out Belichick’s compensation for joining the Tar Heels.</p><p>Athletics beyond football were used as examples in the lawsuit, including an alleged November 2023 closed session to discuss a potential UNC’s ACC alignment, comparing it to "potential financial outcomes with SEC or Big Ten membership."</p><p>The lawsuit alleges another conference realignment closed session occurred in May 2024. </p><p>"The Board again used closed session to debate conference realignment strategy and athletics department finances," the lawsuit reads. "There is no statutory exemption that permits closed discussion of institutional affiliations and budget planning.</p><p>"Each episode follows the same pattern: the Board invokes a statutory exemption, enters closed session, then discusses broad policy or budget matters that must be debated publicly. The Board compounds these violations by maintaining inadequate general accounts that prevent public understanding of what transpired."</p><p>McKenzie has a history with litigation against UNC, having come out on top in a lawsuit against the university and its Board of Trustees after the May 2024 conference realignment session. </p><p>A temporary restraining order was granted on May 16, 2024, one day after McKenzie filed the suit, which stopped the board "from going into closed session to discuss UNC Athletics’ financials, budgeting, deficit or ongoing future conference realignment and related strategic planning." </p><p>UNC later settled that lawsuit with McKenzie for $25,000 in July 2024. </p><p>Belichick’s hire included a closed session, which lasted 41 minutes and ultimately led to his hiring as well as the hiring of women’s head soccer coach Damon Nahas. It was a shock to the football world because Belichick had not coached in college over his illustrious career. </p><p>As the lawsuit states, Belichick was hired at a salary of $10 million per season with additional compensation for bringing his sons Steve and Brian Belichick onto his coaching staff. </p><p>The suit says Belichick’s agreement placed the "total exposure well into the tens of millions over five years."</p><p>Belichick’s college coaching debut has been pedestrian to start. He's 2-2 over his first four games. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New Orleans Pelicans star Zion Williamson showed off his weight loss at the team's media day this week after an intense conditioning program over the summer. </p><p>"I really felt a shift in my body," Williamson told reporters. "I haven’t felt like this since college, high school, just where I can walk into a gym, and I feel good."</p><p>He added that the team's executive vice president of basketball operations, Joe Dumars, who was hired in April, would hold the star accountable.</p><p>"He’s going to hold me accountable, and as he holds me accountable, he’s going to give me a lot of responsibility as well, which I’m excited for," Williamson said of Dumar. "I know he’s going to hold me to a really high standard, and if I slip up or anything, I know he’s going to be right there to make sure I get right back on the path."</p><p>Williamson, entering his seventh season with the Pelicans, has maintained a reputation of being one of the NBA's more overweight players since coming into the league as the No. 1 overall pick out of Duke in 2019. He has also been one of the more injured players, missing 268 NBA games due to injury or other reasons over his career from 2019-20 to 2024-25. </p><p>The 6-foot-6 power forward's trainer, Pelicans director of performance Daniel Bove, aimed to address his fluctuating weight and consistent injuries with the conditioning program this summer. </p><p>The program included boxing workouts and drills run on football fields. </p><p>"I really felt a shift in my body," Williamson said of Bove's program. "It feels good to feel good."</p><p>Pelicans coach Willie Green said the team has been encouraged by the regularity of Williamson’s presence at team headquarters this offseason.</p><p>"I saw his work this summer, his attention to his body, his conditioning," Green said.

<div class="article-title">Hilaria Baldwin explains Alec's absence from 'Dancing with the Stars' after steamy first week</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Alec Baldwin was missing from week two of "Dancing with the Stars," where his wife Hilaria Baldwin performed with partner Gleb Savchenko after their steamy first week.</p><p>Despite Hilaria and Gleb’s spicy dance during week one, that wasn’t why Alec missed the show. Hilaria told Fox News Digital the real reason for his absence.</p><p>"So, Alec is doing a movie right now. He's doing a movie, he's doing a show, he's been traveling so much. He'll be here next week, but we're juggling. </p><p>"We had a certain plan to be in New York right now and then all of a sudden the universe opened and I was offered this incredible experience. And so I packed up all the kids and in a day. I signed the contract to do ‘Dancing with the Stars’ in between landing and getting our luggage. This has been a really wild whirlwind that I'm so grateful for, and it's imposed some shifting," she said.</p><p>While Alec can’t attend every show, the couple’s seven children have been in the audience.</p><p>"So it means that we're not always going to be together because he had committed to some jobs. But he'll come as much as he can and my kids are here to represent and cheer from the crowd," Hilaria told Fox News Digital.</p><p>During week one of "Dancing with the Stars," Hilaria and Gleb shared an intimate moment in which they came face to face. Alec was seen clapping, but fans instantly pointed out his expression.</p><p>"I’m crying the camera panning over to alec baldwin he does not want to be there," one person wrote on X.</p><p>"Alec Baldwin watching Hilaria and Gleb’s steamy Cha-Cha like 😐 That poker face deserves its own mirrorball trophy 😂," another added.</p><p>Other viewers pointed out how the Baldwins always support each other.</p><p>"Alec Baldwin popping up on DWTS 👀 Hilaria hyping him up as always. Gotta respect the support system," one X user noted.</p><p>"Hilaria Baldwin’s gratitude for Alec and the kids' support on *DWTS* is heartwarming. Family backing makes the spotlight a little less intimidating! 💃❤️," another wrote.</p><p>Although Alec may be absent throughout season 34, Hilaria told Fox News Digital that his support means everything.</p><p>"I mean, I can't do it without all of the support that I have, not just from him but from my entire family and from my friends and from Gleb. I mean the person who is spending the most time with me ever and being patient with me and teaching with me. And so I'm, you know, very grateful of him so much. </p><p>"He supports me a lot and I've supported him through a lot. It's a really cool experience to be the one here on the dance floor and people cheering for us," she said.</p><p>When Hilaria was paired with Savchenko, she told him immediately not to take it easy on her. </p><p>"One of the first things I said to him is, you can't offend me. I've been through enough, you can't offend me. And I know that when he pushes me, and he pushes hard, it's with so much love, and he knows that balance. And so every single time he's like, do it better, do it, do better, I take it. </p><p>"I'm like, alright. It gives me drive to do it. But then at the same time, when he said to me, 'I'm proud of you, you did a good job,' I believe him. So he's really the best teacher, the best coach, the best partner, and we've become very close friends over very few weeks. So I'm very grateful for this whole experience," Hilaria said.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">ICE agents' 'rhetoric' against 'noncitizens' blamed for deadly Dallas shooting on MSNBC</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>MSNBC panelists on "Chris Jansing Reports" suggested efforts to "dehumanize" illegal immigrants contributed to a deadly shooting at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas Wednesday.</p><p>At least three people were shot, two of them killed, after a gunman opened fire at the site. The FBI said it is investigating the incident as a "targeted attack" against ICE after uncovering anti-ICE messages written on bullet rounds found near the shooter.</p><p>Jansing asked one of her guests, former ICE assistant chief counsel Veronica Cardenas, about the difficulties ICE agents face today, but Cardenas instead blamed rhetoric used to "dehumanize noncitizens" rather than the dangers ICE agents face.</p><p>"It is very difficult," Cardenas said. "It has been a very divisive environment. And the rhetoric does have to stop. Just yesterday, Homeland Security released a propaganda video on their social website stating or using Nintendo’s Pokémon to ‘catch them all’ and continuing to dehumanize noncitizens.</p><p>"So, how do we fix this?" Jansing asked. "Or at least start to fix this? Because at least both sides say they want to bring down the temperature.</p><p>"The way you fix this is by really ensuring that due process is played out in these arrests, in targeting noncitizens," Cardenas said. "When you read about people being arrested, noncitizens being arrested, it’s already stated illegal. </p><p>"Like, that is something to assume. It’s not allegedly. And, so, creating that where people, noncitizens, are already guilty until proven innocent, gives others this right, this hatred to attack and to justify what they’re doing to noncitizens. And, so, there has to be accountability and responsibility on both sides."</p><p>Jansing turned to MSNBC national security analyst Christopher O’Leary about reports that bullet rounds recovered from the shooter contained anti-ICE messaging. O’Leary similarly argued that the attack stemmed from a "real or perceived grievance" from ICE tactics.</p><p>"We have a decade of intentionally attacking institutions, disinformation, misinformation, conspiracy theories, which led to polarization in society. All of those things have set the conditions for where we are now. And then you throw in the aggressive tactics that ICE has employed and the wearing of masks. That’s where you get political violence coming from," O’Leary said. </p><p>"Political violence doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It’s in response to a real or perceived grievance that somebody has. And they think that this is the best outlet, and that is not justifying it. It’s just where you see these pockets of violence emerge. It’s in response to something."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to MSNBC for comment.</p><p>The MSNBC segment followed a press conference with Joshua Johnson, an acting field office director who criticized the rhetoric targeting ICE agents.</p><p>"The rhetoric has to stop. There are people out there who are seeing what is being placed online, and they’re coming. And they’re doing acts of violence against ICE employees. It’s just got to stop. It’s dangerous, and people are losing their lives," Johnson said.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">EXCLUSIVE: Bondi transfers former death row inmates commuted by Biden to 'supermax' prison</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> Eight federal inmates — once on death row for murders, including the killings of fellow prisoners, gang-related stabbings, and the slayings of two campers — have been transferred to a notorious "supermax" prison in Colorado, the Justice Department told Fox News Digital. The news comes as U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi looks to crack down on the previous administration's sweeping clemency actions.</p><p>The eight former death row inmates were transferred Tuesday to the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado, also known as "ADX," Justice Department officials confirmed. </p><p>They were among the 37 death row inmates whose sentences Biden commuted in late December — prompting criticism and complaints that the record clemency and commutation actions were done as a political "Hail Mary," and without proper vetting.</p><p>More of the death row inmates are expected to be moved to ADX, some within weeks, according to one individual familiar with the matter.</p><p>The 37 death row inmates commuted by Biden are all expected to be moved to the facility by "early next year," the Justice Department source told Fox News Digital.</p><p>The effort comes as Bondi and the Trump administration have sought to reverse some of the Biden administration's efforts on criminal justice reform for certain criminals, and instead moved to prioritize violent crime and cracking down on the nation's worst offenders.</p><p>Though a commutation cannot be fully reversed, Justice Department officials told Fox News Digital, Bondi has prioritized ways to penalize these individuals, in coordination with directives from Trump, and to ensure that the "conditions of confinement" are "consistent with the security risks those inmates present because of their egregious crimes, criminal histories, and all other relevant considerations," according to an earlier DOJ memo. </p><p>The eight inmates sent to ADX this week were each convicted of first-degree murder within federal jurisdiction. </p><p>Many had been convicted of crimes that were especially heinous or violent. One individual was convicted of murdering a married couple who was camping at a campsite in the Ouachita National Forest in July 2003. </p><p>Another was convicted of kidnapping, robbing, and murdering a 51-year-old local bank president by tying him to a concrete block and chain hoist, and tossing him off of a bridge and into a lake. </p><p>Many had also killed prisoners while serving time — a factor that can be used in weighing whether to transfer a convicted felon to a higher-security prison.</p><p>ADX is the only true federal "supermax" prison in the U.S., and its inmates are as notorious as the prison's reputation. Among them are Ramzi Yousef, convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombers; former Sinola Cartel leader Joaquín Guzmán, or "El Chapo"; and Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, the co-founder of al-Qaeda.</p><p>"President Biden’s decision to commute the death sentences of these monsters showed abhorrent disregard for our justice system and total disrespect for victims’ families already suffering through immense loss," Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement to Fox News Digital.</p><p>"After meeting with many of the victims’ families at the Department of Justice and promising to take action on their behalf, eight of these prisoners have been transferred to the Colorado super-max prison ADX. This will ensure that they spend the remainder of their lives in conditions consistent with the egregious crimes they committed," she added.</p><p>Shortly after her confirmation as attorney general, Bondi issued a memo aimed at "restoring a measure of justice" to the victims' families. </p><p>The measures granted by Biden earned more criticism than former President Barack Obama: As Fox News reported at the time, the vast majority of Obama’s clemency actions focused on commuting the sentences of federal inmates who met certain criteria outlined under his administration’s Clemency Initiative.</p><p>Bondi hosted victims' families earlier this year to hear their concerns about the commutations, DOJ said. Some said they had been stunned by the eleventh-hour commutations, and that they not been given a heads-up by the Biden administration.</p><p>In February, Bondi issued a memo to the Bureau of Prisons ordering an evaluation of where these prisoners should be detained.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Drew Lynch shared a TikTok video of a man having a heart attack at his recent show in Spokane, Wash. The audience rushed to help resuscitate the attendee, which brought the comedian to tears. </p><p>In the video, Lynch was in the middle of his set when he noticed something was wrong with someone in the crowd. "Oh, hey. Everything okay?" he asked. </p><p>Another audience member quickly replied, "No."</p><p>A person then shouted, "I’m calling 911 right now."</p><p>According to Lynch's caption, the man was identified as Mr. Wende, who went into cardiac arrest during his show. </p><p>Audience members quickly jumped into action, taking turns performing chest compressions and checking his pulse. After several minutes, one person said Wende was "waking up."</p><p>Paramedics eventually arrived and took Wende away for medical treatment. </p><p>"He had no pulse for over 5 minutes when, by a miracle of God and the efforts of people in that room that night, they were able to revive him. I've never seen anything like it," Lynch wrote in the caption of his TikTok. </p><p>After the man was taken to the hospital, Lynch looked distraught in the video and took a second before he addressed the rest of the crowd. He thanked them for helping save the man, which earned applause from the audience.</p><p>"That was incredible, dude. Like, I know we’re here making jokes and doing a bunch of s--- just about the town, but you guys all really just came together in a really cool way, dude. You saved that guy’s life, man," he said.</p><p>Lynch shared a follow-up video to TikTok and further broke down the incident. He said it took him some time to grasp what was happening in the audience, but "people in the crowd had reacted almost immediately."</p><p>While the man was unresponsive, "People in the room with no identity, no ego, nothing other than just coming together to clear a path, men, women, taking turns doing compressions for CPR, monitoring vitals, calling the paramedics, working on him for over 5 minutes.</p><p>"I’m getting emotional because … I’m a comedian, but who cares? I felt as a human being that I got to experience a group of people coming together to revive someone, to give back someone their life," Lynch said.</p><p>"It’s just a crazy world, man. And it’s been a hard week for a lot of people for a lot of reasons, and the fact that I just got to witness a village, basically, of people just working together and understanding the stakes of the situation, being good-natured. I said it last night, and I’ll say it again: It was a beautiful thing to witness because it restored hope for whatever is going on in the crazy of this world."</p><p>Lynch made a trip to the hospital after his show to check on the man and "finish the show" for him. He shared photos of himself beside Wende in a hospital bed. </p><p>"Sitting and laughing with his family for hours in a hospital room was truly the reminder I needed for why comedy is so needed. In a divided world filled with hurt and uncertainty, we overlook how fragile the time is that we even get to be here. It feels like we forget we're all the same underneath… we're all human," he wrote in the TikTok caption. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Oklahoma state school superintendent Ryan Walters pledged Tuesday to have a Turning Point USA chapter in every high school to honor the group’s co-founder, Charlie Kirk.</p><p>"I’m excited to announce today that every Oklahoma high school will have a Turning Point USA chapter," Walters said in a video on his X account. "We have seen the outpouring from parents, teachers and students that want to be engaged with the meaningful work going on at Turning Point. They want their young people to be engaged in a process that understands free speech, open engagement, dialogue about American greatness, a dialogue around American values."</p><p>He added, "For far too long, we have seen radical leftists with the teachers unions dominate classrooms and push woke indoctrination on our kids. They fight parents’ rights. They push parents out of the classroom, and they lie to our kids about American history. What we’re going to continue to do is make sure our kids understand American greatness, engage in civic dialogue and have that open discussion. We will continue to do all that we can to make sure Oklahoma students have the best education possible."</p><p>Walters faced some criticism for his announcement, particularly from Democrats.</p><p>"Listening to conservative radio host Chad Alexander. He says this is just another pathetic attempt by Walters to win over Republicans while tanking in the polls. Walters has zero power to enforce it and won’t investigate a thing," Oklahoma Democratic state Rep. Mickey Dollens wrote on X.</p><p>Tulsa Public Schools board member John Croisant, a 2026 Democratic congressional candidate, said in an interview with KGOU that Tulsa Public Schools will not take part in "pushing political organizations within our schools."</p><p>"And he can't make us," Croisant said. "Because that's not a part of accreditation."</p><p>Former DNC spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa spoke out against Walters on CNN.</p><p>"I do not think that we should be forcing ideology on our children, especially in public schools," Hinojosa said Tuesday. "After the shooting of Gabby Giffords, we were not forcing ideology in Arizona about guns. After the Minnesota state legislator was killed and her husband was killed in their home by an anti-abortion activist, we weren’t going into Minnesota schools trying to promote abortion in those schools."</p><p>Walters responded to Hinojosa’s comments on "The Story with Martha MacCallum" Wednesday, calling the criticism "laughable." </p><p>"These are the people that forced ‘Drag Queen Story Hour’ on your kids. They force critical race theory on your kids. They force the most radical woke agenda in the country on your kids. The teachers unions and the Democratic Party did that," Walters said.</p><p>He continued, "Then when students and teachers say ‘we want a Turning Point chapter,’ that we have not seen anything like this before. We are excited and want to take the country back, and we want kids to think freely. We want them to understand American values. The unions and the Democrats cry foul. You have to be kidding me with this. We have never seen a Marxist ideology pushed on this like that party has for the last decade."</p><p>Walters said that his announcement coincided with requests from parents and students for new chapters and that he is working with Turning Point USA on the measure.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Walters and Turning Point USA for comment.</p><p>Since Kirk’s assassination at a Utah campus event two weeks ago, Turning Point USA has received tens of thousands of requests to form new campus chapters. Turning Point USA currently operates 900 official college chapters and approximately 1,200 high school chapters.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New York Mets play-by-play announcer Gary Cohen criticized Chicago Cubs third baseman Matt Shaw for skipping a game Sunday to attend Charlie Kirk’s memorial in Arizona, and New York sports radio hosts ripped into him Wednesday morning.</p><p>WFAN’s Gregg Giannotti, co-host of "Boomer and Gio," blasted Cohen, who took exception to Shaw attending the memorial. Kirk’s wife, Erika, reached out to Shaw personally to attend given their friendship. </p><p>The Cubs, in the middle of a pennant race, lost Sunday’s game 1-0 to the Cincinnati Reds.</p><p>"I, quite frankly, didn’t like his commentary, and I’m not going to now dislike Gary Cohen over it. He’s a great broadcaster. He’s been a part of my life for a long time. I thought it was completely unnecessary," Giannotti said over the airwaves.</p><p>"Gary Cohen’s whole life has been baseball, and baseball’s a very serious thing for him. But Matt Shaw saw his friend get shot and killed, got shot in the neck in front of his family and his wife requested that he be there. And Gary Cohen’s got a problem with that because the Cubs are in a pennant race? Have we lost all touch with reality here?"</p><p>Cohen said he didn’t want to talk "about any of the politics of it," but Giannotti and his co-host, former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason, believe the second that was brought up in his statement made it political.</p><p>"You get into the politics by saying that," Esiason said.</p><p>Cohen also mentioned Shaw’s absence did not fall under MLB’s bereavement policy.</p><p>"Who gives a crap? If he wants to go to that, he can go to that," Giannotti countered. "And don’t be mad at him. Why you’re mad, why you care, I have no idea. But be mad at the Cubs who granted him the ability to go."</p><p>Esiason added, "I saw the interview with [Shaw], and he was talking about how he was friendly with Charlie Kirk because they lived in the same area. There’s a couple of pictures of him and Charlie Kirk together, and if Erika Kirk is reaching out to him, what are you supposed to do?"</p><p>Then, Giannotti posed a question to Cohen.</p><p>"Let’s say we didn’t know who Charlie Kirk was, and Matt Shaw was friends with somebody who got shot in the neck and killed in front of his family. Would Gary Cohen have a problem with that because he doesn’t know the person who got shot and killed in front of his family? Or was it because Charlie Kirk had a political platform that Gary Cohen disagrees with, so now it’s weird a baseball player goes over there?"</p><p>Cohen’s comments came late in the game between the Mets and Cubs Tuesday night while Shaw was up to bat.</p><p>"The thought of leaving your team in the middle of a race for any reason other than a family emergency really strikes me as weird," Cohen said.</p><p>His broadcasting partner, former big league player Todd Zeile, added to Cohen’s sentiment.</p><p>"It’s unusual. I think it’s unprecedented, at least from my experience as a player. And I think it made it a little more unusual that it was not revealed until after it came to issue because he was thought to be in the dugout and maybe available and was not, and that’s how it was revealed," Zeile said.</p><p>Shaw told media members Tuesday night why he made it a point to attend the memorial despite his team’s schedule.</p><p>"My connection with Charlie was through our [Christian] faith," Shaw said before the Cubs opened a new series with the New York Mets on Tuesday, per the Chicago Sun-Times. "And that’s something that drives me every day, the reason why I’m able to do what I do every day. And that’s something I’m extremely thankful for.</p><p>"I know without my faith and without the many blessings I’ve been given in my life, that I wouldn’t be here, be able to talk to you guys, able to help this team eventually go and win championships.</p><p>"That’s something I feel really, really blessed about, so whatever backlash comes is OK. I feel strong about my faith and that what was meant to be happened."</p><p>Kirk, a native of Arlington Heights, a northern suburb of Chicago, was "one of the biggest Cubs fans I ever met," according to Shaw. After a conversation with manager Craig Counsell and some teammates, Shaw felt his decision to attend the memorial was accepted.</p><p>"The reason Charlie and I connected so close was because of our faith," Shaw added. "That’s something that drives me every single day, something that I think about all the time. So, if people are wondering who I am and what I stand for, I’d say that my faith and the many blessings I’ve been given are why I’m able to be here.</p><p>"And I just want to make sure that I can give that back to people, that I can support people around me, that I can love people around me the same way that I’ve been blessed."</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>On Wednesday's episode of "The View," co-host Whoopi Goldberg suggested it may be time to consider invoking the 25th Amendment against President Donald Trump following his address to the United Nations General Assembly Tuesday.</p><p>Discussing Trump's address, Goldberg argued other countries aren't laughing at the United States, they're actually "really concerned for us."</p><p>While criticizing Trump's efforts to resolve the war between Russia and Ukraine, Goldberg said, "He had an opportunity to do so much more than he offered them, and they don’t consider him to be serious anymore, and I’m worried. What is the amendment, the 20—".</p><p>The co-hosts took their guesses at which amendment Goldberg was referencing, making multiple attempts before co-host Sonny Hostin eventually informed them that it was the 25th Amendment.</p><p>"I didn’t know what you meant. You meant when you start questioning someone’s competence and mental acuity," Hostin added.</p><p>"Well, they questioned Biden’s competence," Goldberg quickly shot back. "If Biden had acted like this, I would have said take him and sit him down somewhere, but this was not — this was not presidential, and this was not helpful."</p><p>The 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution defines the process for presidential succession and the transfer of power if the president is unable to perform his or her duties. It can be used when a president dies, resigns or lacks the mental or physical capacity to serve in office.</p><p>In the lead-up to their discussion about the 25th Amendment, Hostin accused the president of lying to the U.N. General Assembly about ending seven wars across the globe in the hopes of winning a Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>This set off a debate among the co-hosts about whether Trump would deserve a Nobel Peace Prize for ending the war between Ukraine and Russia.</p><p>Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin was the outlier of the group, arguing that she welcomes Trump's "about-face" on Ukraine and that he would deserve the award if he is able to achieve peace between the two warring countries.</p><p>Goldberg claimed the frightening aspect of the president's most recent about-face on Ukraine is that it will eventually "lead to another about-face" and that the rest of the world is concerned for America under his leadership.</p><p>"They are worried for us," Hostin concurred. "And I want to say this about Americans. Seventy-six percent of Americans say Trump doesn’t deserve to win the Nobel Peace Prize. … His own country doesn’t think that!"</p><p>Hostin appeared to be citing a recent Washington Post/Ipsos poll. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>U.S. fighter jets were scrambled Wednesday to identify and intercept four Russian warplanes flying near Alaska, the North American Aerospace Defense Command said in a statement. </p><p>NORAD said two Russian Tu-95 long-range strategic bombers and two Su-35 fighter jets were flying in the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), which is international airspace that abuts U.S. and Canadian sovereign airspace.</p><p>NORAD responded Wednesday by sending an E-3 early warning and control aircraft, along with four F-16s and four KC-135 tanker planes, "to positively identify and intercept" the Russian aircraft in the Alaskan ADIZ.</p>
<p>NORAD said Russian military activity in the ADIZ is common and not considered a threat, but it was the latest in a series of flights by Russian aircraft seen by many as testing the preparedness of U.S. and allied NATO nations. It came as officials in Denmark continued investigating <span class="link">still-unattributed, large drones that flew close to Copenhagen Airport</span> on Tuesday and Wednesday, disrupting traffic.</p><p>Danish police have said the drones were operated by a "capable actor." </p><p>European nations have been on alert amid <span class="link">Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine</span>. Russian drones were <span class="link">shot down by Polish and allied NATO warplanes</span> after crossing into Polish airspace on Sept. 9. Ten days later, Estonia said several Russian fighter jets entered its airspace.</p>
<p>The Russian planes entered the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone on Wednesday about one month after a <span class="link">very similar incident</span>, which also saw the U.S. scramble fighter jets for an interception.</p><p>In late August, NORAD said it had detected and surveilled a Russian military reconnaissance aircraft inside the ADIZ after intercepting the same type of spy plane over the region three times in the preceding days.</p><p>In September 2024, <span class="link">NORAD posted dramatic video</span> of a Russian jet flying "within just a few feet" of NORAD aircraft off the coast of Alaska. At the time, a U.S. general said the conduct of the jet's crew was "unsafe, unprofessional, and endangered all."</p><p>The ADIZ is "a defined stretch of international airspace that requires the ready identification of all aircraft in the interest of national security," NORAD said.</p>
<p>None of the situations thus far has resulted in Russian warplanes entering U.S. or Canadian sovereign airspace.</p>

<section class="content__body">
<p><em>Bangkok —</em> A massive sinkhole swallowed part of a major road in Bangkok on Wednesday, disrupting traffic, damaging infrastructure and prompting evacuations in the surrounding area. </p><p>There were no casualties, but three vehicles were damaged by the collapse, regional Governor Chadchart Sittipunt said, adding that officials believe the sinkhole was caused by construction work at an underground train station.</p><p>Videos of the collapse show a section of the road slowly sinking, pulling down several electricity poles and damaging water pipes. Cars tried to back away as the hole grew larger and completely severed the four-lane road. One edge of the hole stopped in front of a police station, exposing its underground structure.</p>
<p>People were evacuated from the police station and other buildings. A nearby hospital said it would close the outpatient services for two days, although Bangkok city officials said the hospital's structure was not affected.</p><p>Officials cut electricity and water in the area as a precaution. Chadchart said crews were working to fix the hole as quickly as possible, fearing heavy rain could cause further damage. Bangkok is experiencing its rainy season, which typically extends from May through October.</p><p>Emergency workers used a crane with a large harness to remove a pickup truck that was left perched precariously on the edge of the precipice, and at least one other truck could be seen inside the roughly 160-foot-deep hole.</p>
<p>Noppadech Pitpeng, a 27-year-old hospital worker who lives nearby, told the French news agency AFP that he was frightened by a rumbling sound Wednesday morning, which woke him up.</p>

<div class="article-title">White House tells agencies to prepare for layoffs if government shuts down</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) sent a memo to federal agencies Wednesday night telling them to prepare layoff plans if there is a government shutdown, increasing the stakes <span class="link">ahead of Congress' Tuesday deadline</span> to pass a government funding bill. </p><p>The news was first reported by Politico.</p><p>The memo, obtained by CBS News, tells agencies to consider reduction-in-force notices — a federal term for layoffs — for employees in programs, projects or activities that have discretionary funding that stops on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. It also goes further and says that employees should get RIF notices if they're in programs or projects "not consistent with the President's priorities." </p><p>The RIF notices would be in addition to any furlough notices directing federal workers to stay home from work without pay if there is a shutdown, the memo states. </p><p>"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government," the memo states. </p>
<p>An OMB official said that several programs will continue regardless of a shutdown, including Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits, military operations, law enforcement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and air traffic control. These are statutory federal programs and would not be impacted by any potential reductions-in-force.</p><p>"We remain hopeful that Democrats in Congress will not trigger a shutdown and the steps outlined above will not be necessary. The President supports enactment of a clean CR to ensure no discretionary spending lapse after September 30, 2025, and OMB hopes the Democrats will agree," the memo ends with.  </p><p>During the last few major government shutdowns, the executive branch has temporarily furloughed staff who are deemed non-essential and asked people in critical jobs to keep working without pay. After the shutdown ends, federal workers are normally paid back for their missed paychecks. It's far less common for the government to consider permanent layoffs.</p><p>Bobby Kogan, a former OMB official during the Biden administration, said the mass firings would be "an action of enormous self-harm inflicted on the nation, needlessly ridding the country of talent and expertise." </p>
<p>"It's also extortive. 'Give us what we want in a funding fight, or we'll hurt the country,'" Kogan said in a statement. </p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called the memo "an attempt at intimidation."</p><p>"Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one—not to govern, but to scare. This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government," he wrote, predicting that any laid-off workers will be hired back.</p><p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, also a New York Democrat, wrote on X: "We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings. Get lost."</p><p>The current fiscal year ends on Tuesday, Sept. 30, meaning the government will enter a shutdown Wednesday if Congress doesn't pass a new funding package.</p><p>A Republican short-term funding bill that <span class="link">passed the House</span> has failed to reach the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate. With a 53-seat Senate majority, Republicans need to earn the support of at least seven Democrats to resolve the funding dispute. Meanwhile, Democrats are <span class="link">asking for several concessions</span>, including a rollback of this year's Medicaid cuts and an extension to health insurance tax credits, in exchange for their votes.</p><p>On Tuesday, President Trump canceled a meeting with Democratic congressional leaders to negotiate on a short-term funding patch, saying that their demands were "unserious and ridiculous." </p>
<p>"I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive," he wrote on Truth Social.</p>

<section class="content__body">
<p>Tropical Storm Humberto formed Wednesday in the central tropical Atlantic, and it is anticipated to move northwestward through the next several days, according to the National Hurricane Center.</p><p>The storm is one of two systems swirling over the western Atlantic that could potentially bring some downstream impacts to parts of the Southeast U.S. coast from Florida up to North Carolina, the director of the Miami-based hurricane center, Michael Brennan, said.</p><p>Currently, there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect. </p><h2>Tropical Storm Humberto forecast and path</h2><p>As of the NHC's Wednesday evening update, Humberto is located about 505 miles northeast of the Leeward Islands.

<p>Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles from the center of Humberto.</p>
<p>Due to warm sea surface temperatures and mid-level relative humidity, Humberto is "within a favorable environment for strengthening," the NHC said.</p><p>It is the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season.

<div class="article-title">Federal prosecutors near decision on whether to charge James Comey, sources say</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington</em> — Federal prosecutors are nearing a decision about whether to seek an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime foe of President Trump's, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell CBS News. </p><p>It's unclear what alleged crimes Comey could be charged with, but multiple media outlets have reported that prosecutors have looked into charging him with lying to Congress when he testified in 2020 about the origins of the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The five-year statute of limitations for that runs out on Tuesday.</p><p>Prosecutors are considering presenting a case against Comey to a grand jury, sources told CBS News. In order to indict him, a majority of the grand jury would need to vote that there is probable cause to believe a crime was committed — a lower standard than the burden of proof needed to secure a criminal conviction.</p><p>If Comey is charged, it would mark a dramatic escalation in the Trump administration's push to punish the president's adversaries. Just four days ago, Mr. Trump penned a Truth Social post that appeared to urge Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into Comey, among others, calling them "guilty as hell" and writing, "JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED."</p><p>Mr. Trump also said Saturday he had fired the <span class="link">top federal prosecutor</span> in the Eastern District of Virginia. A day earlier, the official, Erik Siebert, announced his resignation amid concerns from prosecutors in the office that he could be removed for refusing to charge another Trump political foe, New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer Lindsey Halligan, who has no prosecutorial experience, was <span class="link">sworn in</span> as interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia on Monday.</p><p>Comey and the president have sparred for years. In the lead-up to the 2016 election, Comey oversaw investigations into alleged Russian election interference — including whether Russia sought to aid Mr. Trump's campaign — and into Hillary Clinton's private email server. The FBI's handling of both probes has drawn heavy scrutiny, and the Russia investigation, dubbed "Crossfire Hurricane," has long outraged Mr. Trump and his allies.</p><p>Mr. Trump fired Comey months into his first term in 2017, and the two have slammed each other periodically ever since. Comey has called Mr. Trump "morally unfit" to be president and has <span class="link">accused</span> Mr. Trump of demanding that Comey pledge his loyalty to him when he was FBI director. Mr. Trump has accused Comey of lying and suggested he should be jailed.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump's return to office, he has continued to rail against the FBI and other agencies involved in the Russia probe. In recent months, the Justice Department has been <span class="link">investigating</span> the handling of classified Russia-related materials by former senior FBI officials, and intelligence agencies have <span class="link">revisited their Russia investigations</span>. In 2017, U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 race and had a preference for Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>The handling of the Comey probe has worried some legal experts.</p><p>"What is different about this case is that there clearly has been significant presidential pressure brought to bear," Tom Dupree, a George W. Bush-era Justice Department official, told CBS News. "You don't want a universe in which that pressure distorts the prosecutorial judgement and makes prosecutors make charging decisions based not on the evidence, but on what they think will please the president."</p>

<div class="article-title">Judge rules Trump admin. can't require states to cooperate with ICE to get FEMA grants</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A federal judge ruled Wednesday it is unconstitutional for the Trump administration to require states to cooperate with immigration enforcement in order to get some Federal Emergency Management Agency grants — a legal setback in the administration's push to revoke funding to "sanctuary" cities and states. </p><p>U.S. District Judge William Smith of Rhode Island ruled in favor of 20 mostly Democratic states that had sued FEMA, accusing the administration of "holding critical emergency preparedness and response funding hostage" unless they assist immigration agents. </p><p>The decision is likely to be appealed.</p><p>The states that sued — which include California, New York and Illinois — took issue with a Department of Homeland Security document issued earlier this year that says recipients of DHS grants must "honor requests for cooperation" with immigration authorities, including requests to detain migrants or share information. Some of the plaintiffs are "sanctuary" states that have laws restricting cooperation between police and immigration agents.</p><p>The states argued this move violates federal law and the Constitution, and could deprive them of billions per year in key disaster grants from FEMA, which is a sub-agency of DHS.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has argued its policy doesn't violate the law. Also, months after the lawsuit was filed, the government told the court it had decided most of the FEMA disaster grants that the states were concerned about losing will not be tied to immigration cooperation after all. The administration called the lawsuit moot on those grounds. </p><p>The states called the Trump administration's decision not to link disaster grants to immigration enforcement "halfhearted and incomplete," arguing it's unclear if the decision was communicated to agency staff or if it will apply to years beyond 2025.</p><p>In a 45-page ruling Wednesday, Smith sided with the states and granted summary judgment, calling the policy "both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional."</p><p>"Plaintiff States stand to suffer irreparable harm; the effect of the loss of emergency and disaster funds cannot be recovered later, and the downstream effect on disaster response and public safety are real and not compensable," Smith wrote.</p>
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James hailed the ruling in a statement, writing: "The federal government cannot prioritize its cruel immigration agenda over Americans' safety. Today, the court affirmed that it is blatantly unconstitutional for DHS to hold life-saving disaster relief funds hostage to advance its anti-immigration efforts."</p><p>DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin asserted in a statement that cities and states that "break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding."</p><p>"The Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law. No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that," she wrote.</p><p>The ruling follows a monthslong gambit by President Trump to punish "sanctuary" cities and states that limit cooperation between the police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p><p>The Trump administration argues that those jurisdictions make it harder for ICE to apprehend undocumented immigrants, including accused criminals and people who are in state or local custody. But "sanctuary" cities and states typically argue that requiring them to cooperate with ICE would undermine trust in local police and make some immigrants wary of reporting crimes.</p><p>Within hours of returning to office in January, Mr. Trump signed an executive order telling federal agencies to ensure that "sanctuary" jurisdictions "do not receive access to Federal funds." Since then, several agencies have moved to restrict grants to "sanctuary" cities and states, including the <span class="link">Department of Justice</span> and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p><p>Those moves have drawn lawsuits from Democratic cities and states. Last month, a San Francisco-based judge <span class="link">blocked the Trump administration</span> from cutting off funding to almost three dozen cities and counties, including Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Boston.</p>

<div class="article-title">Some Massachusetts cranberry farmers are restoring their bogs into wetlands</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Carver, Massachusetts</em> — For Jarrod Rhodes, a fourth-generation cranberry farmer in Carver, Massachusetts, a 30-acre state project is taking a portion of his family's land back in time.</p><p>"In 10 years, I hope it looks like a natural swamp," Rhodes told CBS News of the project's outcome. "And just, kind of, everything that it may have looked like, you know, before we were here." </p><p>As cranberry prices fall due to global competition and costs increase due to labor issues, higher utility costs <span class="link">and extreme weather</span>, cranberry farmers like Rhodes are part of the Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration's Cranberry Bog Program that pays farmers to turn unproductive bogs back into wetlands.</p><p>The restoration project for the bogs owned by the Rhodes family is about 95% complete. It will be only a matter of time before native plants begin to return. </p><p>Massachusetts has restored over 500 acres of wetlands over the past 15 years through the program, with another 500 acres planned. </p>
<p>According to the Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration, the state has about 13,250 acres of cranberry farms. Massachusetts is the second-largest grower of cranberries in the U.S. behind Wisconsin, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. </p><p>The state allocates around $1 million a year to the restoration program, while leveraging other local and federal grants to do these restorations. </p><p>For Massachusetts cranberry farmers, the program is one way to preserve their land as a generation of farmers nears retirement. </p><p>"They want to make sure that the land that they've tended to for so long is like, in good hands, whether that be a restoration program, or passing it on to the next generation," said Karen Cahill, deputy executive director of the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers Association, a trade group which represents cranberry farmers in the state. </p>
<p>Under the program, the farmers keep the land, but the public can enjoy it too. An example of a restoration process that worked was the Eel River headwaters in Plymouth in 2010, where 60 acres of former bogs are now beautiful wetlands, filtering water, storing carbon and providing storm resilience. They are also open for hiking and wildlife. </p><p>Beth Lambert helps oversee the state's restoration program, including the projects at Eel River and Carver.</p><p>"Many of the cranberry farms in Massachusetts were constructed on wetlands," Lambert said. "And what we're doing is, we're restoring those underlying drivers of water, the soil, and then we let Mother Nature take it from there."</p><p>Back on Rhodes' farm, streams now wind through areas where cranberry vines once grew. </p><p>"It's cool to see it kind of all bare," Rhodes said. "Just kind of waiting for it to grow back and see if it actually works the way that it was supposed to." </p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said <span class="link">the shooting</span> at a <span class="link">Dallas processing facility</span> that left one detainee dead on Wednesday "could have been worse," telling CBS News the sniper's shots were "indiscriminate" and other people could have been hit during the attack. </p><p>Todd Lyons, ICE's acting director, said <span class="link">the shooter</span>, who officials say died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, "<span class="link">fired indiscriminately</span>" into the ICE field office in Dallas and vehicles stationed there. He said a group of detainees was inside one vehicle at the time of the shooting, after being recently arrested by ICE. </p><p>Lyons said three detainees in ICE custody were shot, one fatally. He noted two detainees remained in critical condition as of Wednesday afternoon. ICE has said no agency employees were harmed during the attack.</p><p>But Lyons said the shooting could have been deadlier, citing the shooter's "high-powered rifle" and the area he targeted. Officials say the shooter fired from a nearby rooftop.</p><p>"What's even scarier is the location where the field office is. There's businesses around there, busy I-35," Lyons told CBS News during an interview in New York, noting the shooting occurred when people were going to work and school in the early morning.</p>
<p>"He could have, in his indiscriminate fire, hit people traveling to work, civilians on the ground," he said, calling it "a very scary situation."</p><p>"But unfortunately, someone did lose their life, and it was a definite attack on an ICE facility," he added.</p><p>Lyons said he believes the shooter deliberately targeted federal law enforcement officials, citing bullet casings that officials said were found with anti-ICE messaging on them.</p><p>"When you have anti-ICE rhetoric written on the bullets, you know who they're targeting," he said.</p>
<p>Lyons identified the deceased shooter as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, saying preliminary information indicates he acted alone. </p><p>Asked if ICE plans to implement new security measures in light of Wednesday's shooting, Lyons said the agency had already been operating under a "higher threat posture" but would "reevaluate how we're doing operations."</p><p>He said operations by ICE, which President Trump has charged with overseeing the largest deportation operation in American history, would not be slowed by the shooting.</p><p>"We won't be stopped by it," Lyons said. "We're gonna ensure that we're out there taking these public safety threats off the street, but we will have to go ahead and ensure that the men and women of ICE have all the equipment they need, all the protection they need and all the support they need."</p>

<p>The <span class="link">much-anticipated episode</span> of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following the comedian's return from his suspension drew a broadcast audience about four times larger than average, according to Nielsen ratings data. This was despite the late-night show being preempted by about a quarter of all ABC affiliate TV stations in the U.S. </p><p>Tuesday's show drew an estimated 6.26 million total broadcast viewers, Disney said in a news release Wednesday, per numbers compiled by Nielsen, an audience measurement firm. The data does not include those who watched the episode on streaming platforms.</p><p>For comparison, according to numbers provided to CBS News by a Disney spokesperson, Kimmel's show averaged 1.42 million broadcast viewers during its 2024-25 season — less than a quarter of what it saw on Tuesday night.</p><p>Tuesday's broadcast also drew a 0.87 rating in the coveted demographic of adults ages 18 to 49, Disney said, the highest for a single episode of Kimmel's show since March 2015. The show averaged a 0.13 rating for that age group last season, Disney said.</p><p>Kimmel's monologue also drew more than 26 million views on YouTube and other social platforms, according to Disney, which owns ABC. In it, he showed a video clip of President Trump criticizing  the show, saying it "had no ratings."</p>
<p>The host responded: "Well, I do tonight."</p><p>The late-night show <span class="link">was temporarily preempted</span> last week following comments Kimmel made during a Sept. 15 monologue regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p><p>"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it," Kimmel said at the time. </p><p>In a Sept. 17 interview, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr called Kimmel's remarks "some of the sickest conduct possible," and said there was a "path forward for suspension over this." Within hours of Carr's comments, two major station owners, Nexstar and Sinclair, announced they were preempting Kimmel's show indefinitely from their affiliates, while ABC also announced that it was "indefinitely" suspending the show.</p>
<p>Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase fellow station operator Tegna <span class="link">for $6.2 billion</span>, and needs the FCC's approval for it to go through.  </p><p>While ABC announced Monday that it had made the decision to bring Kimmel back to the airwaves, both Nexstar and Sinclair <span class="link">said this week</span> that the show will continue to be preempted indefinitely.</p><p>Nexstar said it is "continuing to evaluate the status" of the show. It operates 33 ABC affiliates, while Sinclair runs 38 ABC stations. According to Disney, the two media companies account for ABC stations in about 23% of the U.S. market, including in large cities such as Nashville and Seattle.</p><p>In his monologue Tuesday, while he did not issue a blanket apology over his comments, Kimmel said that "it's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it."</p><p>In a Sept. 17 Truth Social post following Kimmel's suspension, Mr. Trump — who has railed against late-night hosts for years going back to his first administration, and has specifically criticized their ratings — wrote on Truth Social that "[t]he ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED."</p><p>Before the show aired Tuesday, Mr. Trump again took to social media to write that "I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled!"</p>

<div class="article-title">Deadly shooting at Dallas ICE facility investigated by FBI as targeted attack</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>One person was killed and two people are in critical condition after a shooting at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas on Wednesday morning, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. </p><p>Acting ICE director Todd Lyons identified the shooter as 29-year-old <span class="link">Joshua Jahn</span>. He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said. </p><p>All three of the victims shot were detainees of the facility, federal authorities said. </p><p>DHS issued a correction Wednesday afternoon after previously reporting that two people were killed and one person was in critical condition.</p><p>The facility is located along I-35E, just southwest of Dallas Love Field Airport.</p>
<p>Dallas police said officers responded to an assist officer call at the facility around 6:40 a.m. An initial law enforcement report indicated the gunman was positioned at an elevated location. The gunman opened fire from the rooftop of an attorney's office across the street from the ICE Detention facility, on Empress Street.    </p><p>Just after 10 a.m., ICE said the scene was secured. According to ICE, the shooter opened fire on the facility, firing "indiscriminately at the building and those in the sallyport."</p><p>"Early evidence that we've seen from rounds that were found near the suspected shooter contain messages that are anti-ICE in nature," said Joe Rothrock, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas field office.</p><p>FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo and wrote, "One of the unspent shell casings recovered was engraved with the phrase 'ANTI ICE.'" </p>
<p>The Dallas Field Office serves as a temporary holding facility for some detainees. Between January 20 and mid-June, an average of 47 people were held there each day, spending roughly seven hours in detention, according to a CBS News analysis of ICE data compiled by the Vera Institute of Justice and the Deportation Data Project.</p><p>The Mexican Consulate in Dallas has confirmed that one of the victims who was shot is a Mexican national.    </p><h2>August bomb threat at same Dallas ICE facility</h2><p>Wednesday's shooting was <span class="link">not the first security threat at the Dallas ICE facility</span>, according to DHS. </p><p>Approximately one month earlier, DHS reported that a man, later identified as 36-year-old Bratton Dean Wilkinson, a U.S. citizen, approached the field office's reporting entrance and claimed to have a bomb in his backpack. </p><p>Wilkinson allegedly showed a security officer what he described as a "detonator" strapped to his wrist, prompting a shelter-in-place order at the Dallas ICE facility, DHS said. The officer immediately contacted 911, and local law enforcement responded with a bomb squad. Wilkinson was taken into custody and later charged with making terroristic threats, DHS said.</p><h2>DHS Secretary blames anti-ICE rhetoric for the Dallas shooting</h2><p>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the violence and called for a national reckoning on the rhetoric surrounding ICE. Federal officials labeled the incident a targeted assault on law enforcement. </p><p>In a strongly worded statement, Noem said:  </p><blockquote><p>"Our prayers are with the families of those killed and our ICE law enforcement. This vile attack was motivated by hatred for ICE. For months, we've been warning politicians and the media to tone down their rhetoric about ICE law enforcementbefore someone was killed. This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences. Comparing ICE Day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences. The men and women of ICE are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. They get up every morning to try and make our communities safer. Like everyone else, we just want to go home to our families at night. The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop. We are praying for the victims and their families."</p></blockquote><p>Noem also ordered DHS to immediately begin increasing security at ICE facilities across the country.  </p>
<h2>State, federal lawmakers react to shooting</h2><p>Local, state and federal lawmakers <span class="link">reacted to the shooting</span>, calling on violence against ICE agents to stop.</p><p>"My hearts and prayers go out to my officers and agents, [that's] my biggest concern as well as everyone in that area but this just shows the violence has been increased against ICE officers and agents," acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said in an interview with CNN.      </p><p>Sen. Ted Cruz was in Dallas Wednesday morning. He repeatedly said that politically motivated violence needs to stop.</p><p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott expressed his support for ICE, saying the state fully supports ICE.     </p><p>"Both the Texas Dept. of Public Safety &amp; Texas National Guard work closely with ICE. This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, &amp; deportation of illegal immigrants," he said on X. "We will work with ICE &amp; the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive. We will offer ICE additional support to assist their operations."    </p><p>Texas Department of Transportation cameras near the facility showed a heavy first responder presence with dozens of units.    </p><p>"Please join me in prayer for the injured and their families from this morning's active shooter incident at the ICE facility in Dallas," Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said on X. "Violence and terror is never the answer to anything."      </p>
<p>The Fort Worth Police Department also posted on X, condemning the violence.    </p><p>"The violence that occurred in Dallas, TX this morning is uncalled for and moments like this are deeply disturbing as it creates more division in our community at a time when the focus needs to be on how we can come together," the post reads. "We continue to ask our community that if you see something, say something."    </p><p>CBS News confirmed that a bomb threat was made to the same office on Aug. 25. A man was arrested and charged after he claimed to have a detonator. He's been detained for weeks.    </p><h2>    Second ICE facility attack in Texas in 2025    </h2><p>A <span class="link">Fourth of July attack</span> at a Texas immigration detention center injured a police officer, who was shot in the neck.     </p><p>Attackers dressed in black military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. At least 11 <span class="link">people have been charged</span> in connection with the attack.    </p><h2>    Attack against CBP federal agents in McAllen, Texas     </h2><p>A man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents as they were leaving a <span class="link">U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen</span> on July 7.     </p><p>The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a police officer who responded to the scene before authorities shot and killed him. Police later found other weaponry, ammunition and backpacks inside his car.    </p>
<p>"The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop," Vice President JD Vance said on X. "I'm praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families."    </p>

<div class="article-title">Syria's president warns Israel's actions could alienate U.S. allies</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa says Israel's military action in the region could be detrimental to the U.S. and may result in its allies turning away fromAmerica. </p><p>Al-Sharaa, who has past ties to al Qaeda and the Islamic State, spoke with Margaret Brennan, on assignment in Syria for "60 Minutes," ahead of his historic address to the United Nations in New York. Al-Sharaa took power after <span class="link">ousting</span> former Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad following nearly 14 years of civil war. In December, the U.S. removed a $10 million bounty off al-Sharaa's head.In July, the <span class="link">U.S. lifted</span> its terrorist designation of the rebel group he led.  </p><p>Al-Sharaa said Israel's <span class="link">recent attack on Hamas leaders</span> who were in Qatar — a close U.S. ally — and <span class="link">its airstrikes</span> on the grounds near Syria's presidential palace put "the interests of the U.S. and its strategic allies at risk, pushing those allies to consider alternatives to America." </p><p>"Bombing the presidential palace amounts to nothing less than a declaration of war on Syria," he told Brennan. "What if the backyard of the White House was bombed? The United States would wage war against whoever targeted the White House backyard for the next 20 years." </p><p>Syria did not retaliate for those Israeli strikes. The U.S. launched a diplomatic effort led by U.S. special envoy to Syria Tom Barrack to help de-escalate tensions.</p>
<p>"There are borders and international standards that must be respected," he said. "There are international laws, the United Nations and the Security Council that we turn to, to protect those standards. Otherwise, the world would fall into massive chaos." </p><p>On Wednesday, al-Sharaa became the first Syrian head of state to speak at the U.N. General Assembly in nearly 60 years. In his speech, he spoke of the brutality endured by the Syrian people under the Assad regime and described what he called a "historic opportunity to bring stability, peace, and prosperity to Syria and the entire region." Healso warned of regional instability stemming from Israel's actions. </p>
<p>In his nearly 10-minute speech, al-Sharaa told world leaders that Israeli policies and actions "contradict" the international community's support for Syria. He said Syria is committed to reaching a security agreement with Israel to lower tensions. </p><p>The U.S. has been trying to brokeran arrangementbetween Syria and Israel that is similar to a 1974 ceasefire agreement with the Assad regime. After the collapse of the Assad regime in December, Israel invaded territory in southernSyria and created what it calls a "buffer zone" beyond the lines of the 1974 agreement. Al-Sharaawants Israel to return any lands seized since the Assad regime fell, and to have U.N. peacekeepers monitor the new agreement. </p>
<p>An Israeli official declined to comment on al-Sharaa's remarks but confirmed that negotiations with Syria are continuing. </p><p><em>Watch more of the interview this season on "60 Minutes."</em></p><p><em>This story was reported by Margaret Brennan, Andy Court, Annabelle Hanflig, Omar Omar, and Camilla Schick, and produced for CBS Evening News by Justine Redman.</em></p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Prosecutors have moved to drop charges against Travis Decker, the man accused of killing his three young daughters earlier this year before disappearing and sparking a <span class="link">monthslong manhunt</span>, after the U.S. Marshals Service informed them Decker is dead, court documents show. </p><p>Local law enforcement, however, said it is still waiting on DNA test results on remains that are believed to be Decker's that were <span class="link">found in Washington state</span> last week. </p><p>The Chelan County Sheriff's Office said last week the remains, which were discovered Thursday, Sept. 18, were found in a remote wooded area south of Leavenworth, Washington.</p><p>Using a drone, authorities found a decomposed body with bone fragments spread around the hillside, along with clothing and other personal items, Sheriff Mike Morrison said last week. He said the body was found in a "mountainous area" that was not along a trail, and it was about a three-hour hike to get to the remains on foot. </p><p>Decker, a 32-year-old former Army soldier, was accused in May of killing his three daughters, 9-year-old Paityn Decker, 8-year-old Evelyn Decker and 5-year-old Olivia Decker. DNA testing confirmed he was the only suspect in the murders, police have said.</p>
<p>The girls' mother alerted authorities on May 30 that he had not returned the three girls on time to her at her home in Wenatchee, Washington, following a scheduled visit, and a search was launched. The girls' bodies were found three days later at a campsite in the Cascade Mountains, along with Decker's truck. </p>
<p>An autopsy determined their cause of death was suffocation, authorities said. </p><p>In September 2024, Decker's ex-wife, Whitney Decker, filed to modify their custody agreement. In a petition, she wrote that Decker's mental health issues had worsened and that he had become increasingly unstable. She also said he was often living out of his truck. </p><p>Decker, an Army infantryman from March 2013 to July 2021, had extensive training in navigation, survival and other survival skills, authorities previously said. Despite the continued search, police said in late June that they <span class="link">believe he may have died</span> or left the area.   </p>

<div class="article-title">Trump alleges "triple sabotage" at U.N. after escalator and teleprompter freeze up</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump accused the United Nations of "sabotage" and demanded an investigation Wednesday after an escalator and teleprompter malfunctioned during his visit to U.N. headquarters — though the U.N. says a videographer from Mr. Trump's delegation may have triggered the escalator's safety shutoff. </p><p>Shortly after Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump entered U.N. headquarters in New York City on Tuesday to address world leaders at this year's General Assembly session, they stepped onto an escalator. But the machine ground to a halt almost immediately, forcing both Trumps to start climbing the stairs on their own, videos of his arrival show.</p><p>Later, as Mr. Trump began his speech to the General Assembly, he remarked that his teleprompter wasn't working. "I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble," the president said, drawing laughs from the audience.</p><p>The president brought up the two mishaps later in his speech, framing them as metaphors for what he views as the incompetence of the United Nations — which he accused of offering up little more than "empty words."</p><p>"All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that, on the way up, stopped right in the middle. If the first lady wasn't in great shape, she would've fallen," the president said. "These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter."</p>
<p>In a Truth Social post a day later, Mr. Trump claimed the incidents were not a coincidence. He also leveled a third allegation that "the sound was completely off" during his speech. </p><p>"A REAL DISGRACE took place at the United Nations yesterday — Not one, not two, but three very sinister events!" the president wrote. "This wasn't a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN. They ought to be ashamed of themselves."</p><p>Mr. Trump pushed for an "immediate investigation" by the United Nations. </p>
<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt floated a similar explanation on Tuesday, writing in a post on X: "If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately."</p>
<p>Leavitt shared a screenshot from a Times of London article that reported U.N. workers had been overheard joking they might intentionally shut off escalators during Mr. Trump's visit and blame funding shortfalls. There is no evidence that U.N. staff followed through on those jokes.</p><p>The press secretary later told Fox News that the Secret Service is looking into the matter, telling host Jesse Watters that "it doesn't look like a coincidence to me." A federal law enforcement source confirmed to CBS News that the Secret Service is looking into the escalator issue.</p><p>However, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday the escalator may have suddenly stopped because of a videographer from the U.S. delegation who can be seen walking ahead of the president and first lady on the escalator, seemingly to film their arrival.</p><p>"A subsequent investigation, including a readout of the machine's central processing unit, indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator. The safety mechanism is designed to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing. The videographer may have inadvertently triggered the safety function described above," Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, said in a statement.</p><p>Separately, a U.N. official told CBS News that the White House operated the teleprompter for Mr. Trump when it malfunctioned during his speech. </p><p>CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment about the U.N.'s findings.</p><p>Mr. Trump's speech came as his second administration distances itself from the U.N., withdrawing the U.S. from agencies like the Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization. The administration has also cut its financial contributions to the U.N. and criticized its approach to Israel.</p>
<p>"The U.N. has such tremendous potential," the president said in his speech, "but it's not even coming close to living up to that potential."</p>

<div class="article-title">Seasonal hiring could fall to lowest level since 2009, analysis finds</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Retailers around the U.S. are expected to sharply reduce the number of workers they add for the holidays, a shift from their usual seasonal hiring sprees to help cope with the annual crush of customers. </p><p>Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas attributes the weak demand for extra workers this year to companies bearing the heavier costs from U.S. tariffs on foreign goods, as well as on rising inflation and their growing reliance on technology to improve efficiency. </p><p>The firm expects retail hiring fo the holidays to fall to its lowest level since 2009, when the economy was emerging from a recession caused by the global financial crisis. </p><p>"Seasonal employers are facing a confluence of factors this year: tariffs loom, inflationary pressures linger, and many companies continue to rely on automation and permanent staff instead of large waves of seasonal hires," Andy Challenger, workplace expert and senior vice president of Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, said in a statement.</p><p>The weaker seasonal hiring forecast comes as the U.S. job market is faltering. Employers added <span class="link">only 22,000 jobs in August</span>, falling far short of economists' expectations.</p>
<p>Inflation has also edged up in recent months. The Consumer Price Index, which in March had sunk to an annual rate of 2.3%, in August <span class="link">rose at a 2.9%</span> pace from a year ago.</p> <p>In the last quarter of 2024, retailers added just over 543,000 seasonal workers, down roughly 4% compared to 2023. Companies are projected to add fewer than 500,000 jobs during the last three months of 2025, according to Challenger. Such a figure would mark the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years. </p><p>Challenger pointed to fewer seasonal hiring announcements than usual from retailers as a sign they plan to hire fewer workers for the holidays.</p><p>"While we could see a late hiring push if holiday sales surprise to the upside, the cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge. This year may be more about doing more with less," Challenger said. </p>
<p>Tariffs are causing some consumers to pull back on spending, recent data shows. An August survey of consumers from the University of Michigan found that most U.S. adults plan to spend less on goods that see tariff-driven price hikes. Just 24% of consumers surveyed said they expected to spend as usual on items that rise substantially in price, according to the report.</p><p>Tariffs have <span class="link">already driven up the cost</span> of some categories of goods for U.S. consumers. For example, in August, audio equipment rose in price by 12% compared to one year earlier,  while the cost of household goods rose 10%, the latest Consumer Price Index report shows.</p><p>"A wave of uncertainty is impacting not just retailers, but also consumers heading into the final quarter of the year. With hiring slowing across the board, Retailers may hire fewer workers themselves, while many of their shoppers slow spending," Challenger added. </p>

<div class="article-title">Trump says skipping Tylenol while pregnant has "no downside." Doctors disagree.</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Many doctors and public health officials are taking issue with President Trump's claim that there's "no downside" to avoiding acetaminophen during pregnancy and his suggestion that expecting mothers should "tough it out" when it comes to fevers.</p><p>Acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol and many cold and flu medications, is used to reduce pain and fever in pregnancy. </p><p>"Don't take it. There's no downside in not taking it," Mr. Trump said during <span class="link">an announcement Monday</span> that linked the use of the drug during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism in children without giving new evidence and ignoring data that shows there is not a causal relation.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration is "strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary," he said. "That's, for instance, in cases of extremely high fever that you feel you can't tough it out, you can't do it. I guess there's that. It's a small number of cases, I think. But if you can't tough it out, if you can't do it, that's what you're going to have to do. You'll take a Tylenol."</p><p>In an open letter to physicians released after Mr. Trump's announcement, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary was more cautious than the president, writing, "clinicians should consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy for routine low-grade fevers." </p>
<p>But doctors worry the suggestion to "tough it out" will harm women and their babies, as high fever and pain can be dangerous during pregnancy.</p><p>"The messaging of 'tough it out' is something that unfortunately we have said to women in health care in this country for far too long," Dr. Lucky Sekhon, an OB/GYN and infertility specialist in New York City, told CBS News.</p><p>There's also a concern patients may turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy. Makary noted in his letter that "acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics." (Antipyretics are drugs that reduce fever.)</p><p>In a statement, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said, "Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism," calling it "the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy." </p>
<p>"Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives," the company said.</p><h2>The risks of fever during pregnancy</h2><p>Medical experts warn that fevers during pregnancy can cause problems for a developing baby. </p><p>Especially in early pregnancy, fevers are associated with cardiac issues, cleft lip, cleft palate and central nervous system abnormalities, Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News after Mr. Trump's announcement.</p><p>"The idea that we're going to let someone with a fever 'tough it out' may have much worse implications for a pregnant woman than taking a dose of acetaminophen to bring that fever down," he said. "I think that's not really an appropriate way to handle medical issues in pregnancy."</p><p>Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, echoed it's important to not let fevers go untreated due to the risk of brain development issues in the baby.</p><p>"Fever and infections during pregnancy can cause neurodevelopmental disorders including potentially autism," she said. "I worry that this will scare women and that pregnant women may avoid Tylenol even when it's entirely appropriate, for example, to treat a fever."</p><p>Internal medicine physician Dr. Shoshana Ungerleider saidscience does not support the administration's claims.</p>
<p>"What's far riskier is leaving a fever untreated during pregnancy which can harm both mom and baby, so Tylenol remains the safest option we have in those situations," she said. </p><h2>Why Tylenol or acetaminophen is advised</h2><p>Gounder said she's concerned that expectant mothers with a fever or pain may turn to other options that would be less safe. </p><p>"Will women end up taking other medications like aspirin or ibuprofen during pregnancy? Those actually can be dangerous, especially in the third trimester, you can end up with kidney issues, cardiac issues in the baby," she said.</p><p>Fleischman agreed that acetaminophen is the safest option.</p><p>"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication," he told CBS News. "The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism."</p><p>That research, he explained, includes a large study published last year which analyzed data on 2.5 million pregnancies and found no increased risk of autism in children whose mothers took acetaminophen. </p><p>The lead author of that study, Viktor H. Ahlqvist, PhD, of the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, said in an interview that acetaminophen continues to be "the recommended option" for use during pregnancy. </p>
<p>He shared the concern that "alternatives to acetaminophen in the U.S. might be other medications with less-safe profiles, such as opioids or other things to manage pain. We do know that these have serious consequences when used in pregnancy, both for the mom and for the baby."</p><p>These doctors are not alone. Health experts from <span class="link">around the world</span> have pushed back against the Trump administration's claims about acetaminophen and autism.</p><p>The European Union's European Medicines Agency said Tuesday there is "no new evidence" that would require changes to the current recommendations for use of acetaminophen, also called paracetamol outside the U.S.</p><p>"Paracetamol remains an important option to treat pain or fever in pregnant women," Steffen Thirstrup, EMA's chief medical officer, said in the statement. "Our advice is based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children."</p><h2>What should pregnant women do?</h2><p>Pregnant patients should consult with their doctor on what's the best for them, but Fleischman pointed out that acetaminophen is only used when necessary. </p><p>"You don't take Tylenol just for fun. … It's not like a [daily] vitamin, and we would never treat it that way," he said. "Patients are told to use acetaminophen when they have a fever, when they have a headache or other pain symptoms in pregnancy which require treatment." </p><p>The medication is generally recommended for a fever above 100.4, Fleischman explained. </p>
<p>"We know that higher fevers are definitely associated with more issues but if your temperature is above 100.4, taking acetaminophen to bring that down is definitely advised," he said. </p><p>A single extra-strength dose, which is 500 mg, should be "more than adequate," he added, but said it can be repeated if needed. </p><p>"As always, we want our patients to consult with their health care provider before using any medications, but all of the data shows that it's safe and there is no data that shows Tylenol causes autism," Dr. Veronica Gillispie-Bell, a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist, told CBS News.</p><p>She shared concerns over the FDA initiating a label change on Tylenol and acetaminophen to warn of a possible association with autism.</p><p>"I think it will make our moms scared to take Tylenol, and the repercussions, again, for those moms that are having fever and those moms that are having pain, those repercussions can be very detrimental. And it's really shameful when we know that Tylenol is safe and again we have no studies showing that it causes autism," Gillispie-Bell said. </p>

<div class="article-title">Judge won't reinstate 8 government watchdogs fired by Trump</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington — </em>A federal judge on Tuesday declined to reinstate a group of internal watchdogs at eight federal agencies who were fired by President Trump earlier this year, but she wrote that the president broke the law when he ousted them without notifying Congress and providing justification for the removals.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes declined the officials' request for an order allowing them to return to their jobs as inspectors general unless Mr. Trump removes them in a way that complies with federal law. Reyes said the plaintiffs, eight former government watchdogs, failed to show that they had suffered irreparable harm as a result of their firings.</p><p>She noted that even if the officials were reinstated to their roles, as they asked to be, Mr. Trump could remove them again after 30 days by providing notice and a rationale to Congress, requirements laid out in the Inspector General Act.</p><p>"The Court recognizes Plaintiffs' exceptional service as IGs, marked by decades of distinguished leadership across multiple administrations. They sacrificed much to take on the role of an IG and its many demands — no doubt including substantial time away from family and far larger paychecks available in the private sector," Reyes wrote in a 20-page decision. "They deserved better from their government. They still do. Unfortunately, this Court cannot provide Plaintiffs more."</p><p>Still, she said that Mr. Trump violated that law when he fired the internal agency watchdogs without telling Congress or laying out the reasons for the removals.</p>
<p>"President Trump violated the IGA. That much is obvious," Reyes wrote.</p><p>The inspectors general who sued were among a group of 17 whom <span class="link">Mr. Trump fired en masse</span> days after returning to the White House in January. They worked at the Small Business Administration and Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Labor, State, and Veterans Affairs. Inspectors general <span class="link">are tasked with investigating</span> wrongdoing and rooting out fraud and waste at government agency. They work independently from the agencies they oversee, and typically serve across Democratic and Republican administrations.</p><p>The officials were informed of their firings through an email from the White House's Personnel Office, which stated that "due to changing priorities," they were terminated from their respective positions "effective immediately."</p><p>But the removals failed to comply with federal law, which required the president to provide Congress with 30-day notice and "case-specific reasons" for removing an inspector general, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee said in a letter to Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>The senators asked the president to provide and required notice and information "immediately." But Reyes noted in her decision there has not been a response.</p><p>The inspectors general <span class="link">filed a lawsuit</span> challenging the removals in mid-February, arguing that the president violated the Inspector General Act and acted outside of his authority by dismissing them without notifying Congress and providing a rationale. They asked the court to reinstate them to their positions and are seeking back pay.</p><p>Since then, Mr. Trump has nominated new candidates to serve as inspectors general for five of the agencies, and the Senate confirmed one, at the Department of Veterans Affairs, last month.</p><p>The firings are part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to reshape the federal government. He has fired numerous officials appointed by former President Joe Biden to serve at independent agencies, actions that have sparked legal battles.</p><p>The Supreme Court has so far allowed the president to oust officials at four agencies and is currently weighing a bid by the Trump administration to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.</p>

<div class="article-title">RadioShack buyers ran a Ponzi scheme, SEC alleges</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A pair of e-commerce entrepreneurs who bought a number of well-known retail brands — including RadioShack, Modell's Sporting Goods and Pier 1 Imports — out of bankruptcy are accused of running a Ponzi scheme. </p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of the Miami-based Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million.</p><p>Through their holding company, Mehr and Lopez acquired distressed brick-and-mortar companies in order to turn them into successful, online-only brands. Dress Barn and Linens 'n Things were also among their acquisitions. </p><p>REV acquired RadioShack in 2020, three years after the nearly century-old electronics chain filed for its second bankruptcy. RadioShack <span class="link">first filed</span> for Chapter 11 protection in 2015. </p><p>Modell's Sporting Goods filed for bankruptcy in <span class="link">March 2020</span>, during which time it also announced it would be closing all of its stores. REV bought the Modell's brand name and assets in August 2020. Pier 1 Imports — which still exists as an online store — declared bankruptcy in early 2020. REV acquired its trademark name and assets later that same year.</p>
<p>The SEC's suit alleges that between 2020 and 2022, Mehr and Lopez, "made material misrepresentations" to hundreds of investors about the bankrupt retailers they had acquired. For example, to entice individuals to invest in their acquisitions, they said their portfolio companies were "on fire" and that "cash flow is strong." They also told prospective backers that money raised for a company would only be used for that specific firm. That proved not to be the case, according to the SEC's lawsuit, which was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.</p><p>"Contrary to these representations, while some of the REV Retailer Brands generated revenue, none generated any profits," the suit states. "Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations." </p><p>Neither Mehr nor Lopez immediately responded to CBS News' request for comment. </p><p>The SEC alleges that at least $5.9 million of returns paid to investors were actually Ponzi-like payments funded by other investors, as opposed to companies' profits. </p>
<p>Additionally, the federal regulatory agency claims that Mehr and Lopez allocated $16 million worth of investments for their own use, according to the filing. </p>

<div class="article-title">Americans will soon have fingerprints scanned when they go to most of Europe</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Americans traveling to Europe will soon have their fingerprints scanned and picture taken when they arrive in countries like <span class="link">France</span>, <span class="link">Italy</span> and Spain under new regulations being rolled out across the continent starting next month. Those who don't provide such biometric data will be told au revoir, arrivederci or adiós.</p><p>The change comes as the European Union rolls out its new Entry/Exit System for not just Americans but all visitors from outside Europe's Schengen Area, a group of countries that allows people in the zone to travel across borders freely without going through customs checks.</p><p>The new system will be introduced gradually over a roughly six-month period starting Oct. 12. It will eventually replace passport stamps, according to the EU.</p><h2>What new requirements will Americans see under Europe's Entry/Exit System?</h2><p>In addition to the fingerprint scan and being photographed, Americans will have to provide details from their passports like their full name and date of birth. The system will also collect when and where they're entering and leaving the Schengen Area.</p><p>"U.S. citizens traveling to most European countries should expect new automated border checks and to have their biodata digitally collected upon arrival and departure," the State Department said in a social media post.</p>
<p>Travelers who refuse to provide their biometric data through the Entry/Exit System will be denied entry to the region. The system will also keep track of people who were denied entry. As of now, fingerprints of children younger than 12 years old will not be collected, authorities said.</p>
<p>The changes aim to increase security in the Schengen Area, according to the EU. The system will help authorities track who enters and leaves the area and crack down on people who stay longer than they're allowed.</p><p>Americans with passports that are valid for at least six months can generally stay in the Schengen Area for up to 90 days over a 180-day period, according to the State Department. People who want to stay longer or seek employment in Europe may need a visa from the country they're visiting.</p>
<p>Files containing people's personal data will be kept for about three years after their departure, according to the EU. If no exit was recorded, the data will be kept for five years. Exemptions are available to family members of EU citizens and some non-EU nationals.</p><p>The EU said the new system has been in the works for nearly a decade as Europe saw a <span class="link">mass migration</span> of people fleeing Africa and the Middle East for the continent. The expected unveiling of the changes comes on the heels of President Trump's criticism of European leaders' immigration policies in his address at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. </p>
<p>"Your countries are going to hell," Mr. <span class="link">Trump said</span> Tuesday. "It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders."</p><h2>Where will Europe's new Entry/Exit System be used?</h2><p>The system will be used in 29 countries, most of which are in the EU. Four nations that aren't in the bloc — Iceland, the small principality of Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland — will also implement the new requirements. Two EU members, Cyprus and Ireland, will not.</p>
<p>Here's a complete list of the countries that will use the new system:</p><ul><li>Austria</li><li>Belgium</li><li>Bulgaria</li><li>Croatia</li><li>Czechia</li><li>Denmark</li><li>Estonia</li><li>Finland</li><li>France</li><li>Germany</li><li>Greece</li><li>Hungary</li><li>Iceland</li><li>Italy</li><li>Latvia</li><li>Liechtenstein</li><li>Lithuania</li><li>Luxembourg</li><li>Malta</li><li>Netherlands</li><li>Norway</li><li>Poland</li><li>Portugal</li><li>Romania</li><li>Slovakia</li><li>Slovenia</li><li>Spain</li><li>Sweden</li><li>Switzerland</li></ul><p>The U.K. officially <span class="link">separated from the EU</span> in 2020 after being part of the bloc for 47 years. While it isn't part of the new system, the U.K. started requiring international travelers earlier this year to get an electronic travel authorization to visit the country, which includes Northern Ireland. </p><p>Each application for an authorization costs 16 pounds, or about $22, and lasts two years or until the traveler's passport expires, whichever comes first.</p><p>According to the State Department, Americans won't need an authorization if they're transferring through the U.K. on their way to another country and won't pass through border control. Travelers are urged to check with their airline if they are unsure.</p>

<div class="article-title">A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>More than six months after being terminated from her job with the federal government, Jessie Beck got the news she'd been hoping for — sort of.</p> <p>On Sept. 12, U.S. District Judge William Alsup issued his final decision in a case challenging the Trump administration's mass firings of probationary employees, mostly those in their first year or two on the job.</p> <p>In a 38-page order, Alsup wrote that the terminations, dating back to February, were unlawful. But he stopped short of requiring the government to reinstate workers. It was clear to him, he explained, that the Supreme Court would overrule such relief given recent decisions the court had issued on related matters. He also wrote that too much time had passed.</p>
<p>"The terminated probationary employees have moved on with their lives and found new jobs," Alsup wrote. "Many would no longer be willing or able to return to their posts."</p>
<p>Beck, who was a fisheries biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says that is simply not true.</p> <p>"Immediately, I would return to my job, as would many, many others," she says. "We loved our jobs. We worked really hard to be there. And a lot of us have found short-term or other work to fill that gap. But a lot of us have also taken pay cuts to do so and really have suffered a lot of damage to our careers."</p> <p>While Beck says it's validating to read that Alsup found malfeasance in the government's actions, she's extremely frustrated that the relief he offered was so limited.</p> <p>"I think that from the outset, Judge Alsup really had his hands tied," she says. "It seems like the judicial process is being undermined by a higher court."</p> <h3 class="edTag">A victory in court offers little meaningful relief</h3> <p>Through multiple decisions issued on its shadow docket, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court has made clear it believes the Constitution gives the president expansive powers over the executive branch, including the power to hire and fire as he sees fit, despite federal law granting civil servants, including probationary employees, some job protections.</p>
<p>Alsup has clearly taken notice. In April, the court vacated his temporary pause on the probationary firings, leading him to remark the next day in court, "They are the boss. I'm just a district judge."</p>
<p>Although the Supreme Court's shadow docket orders are themselves meant to be temporary, Alsup wrote "the Supreme Court has made clear enough by way of its emergency docket that it will overrule judicially granted relief respecting hirings and firings within the executive, not just in this case but in others."</p> <p>The result for fired employees like Beck is deeply unsatisfying. In the end, the government got to fire her and thousands of others, despite a court's finding that it was illegal. The Trump administration has appealed Alsup's decision.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Pushed into a tough job market</h3> <p>Beck was ten months into her job at NOAA when she was fired on February 27 as part of the Trump administration's purge of probationary workers. She had been working with fisheries in Alaska to find ways to reduce harm to seabirds while not harming the bottom line of fishing communities.</p>
<p>She had come to the government after more than a decade doing related work at a nonprofit, because she wanted a more direct role in figuring out solutions to conservation challenges.</p> <p>Now, she's struggling to get her career back on track. Under the Trump administration, there have been deep cuts to funding for science, and the market is flooded with qualified candidates searching for jobs.</p> <p>At 38, Beck has been piecing together short-term work, but it's not enough to make up for what she lost. She and her husband were trying to have a child when she got fired, and she says her financial instability is making that all the more difficult.</p> <p>"It's been a real lesson in living in uncertainty," she says.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">His skills were in demand, but now he's struggling to find work</h3> <p>A federal employee fired from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services is likewise still grappling with the consequences of his termination.</p> <p>At 50, the health care technology expert has been unable to land a new job. He has gotten some initial interviews only to be told the companies are not interested in moving forward with him. Sometimes he hears nothing at all. NPR agreed not to name him, because he fears speaking out publicly could further complicate his efforts to get another job.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his attempts to get unemployment insurance through the state of New York, where he worked, have gone nowhere. Online, he sees that his claim is "under review." He's tried calling 20 or 25 times in hopes of reaching someone who can help.</p> <p>"Nobody's available to talk to you," he says. "The phone gets disconnected."</p> <p>It's a trying situation for someone whose decades of experience in health care IT appeared highly prized as recently as last year. When he was hired by the government in 2024, he was told he was one of 1,300 applicants for three positions.</p> <p>"I was totally enjoying it, doing some meaningful work," the former government employee says. He'd received a strong performance review in January, shortly before he was fired.</p> <p>He was looking forward to finding ways to use artificial intelligence to find inaccuracies in clinical data. Now, he's not sure whether someone else will pick up the work. He only knows with Alsup's order, it's not going to be him.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A judge highly critical of the Trump administration's actions</h3> <p>Since February, Alsup has been highly critical of the government, calling the mass firing of probationary employees for performance reasons "a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements" for downsizing the government. At times, he questioned whether government lawyers were telling him the truth.</p>
<p>Back in March, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt released a statement, accusing the judge of "attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch," and inviting him to run for president himself.</p>
<p>In his Sept. 12 order, Alsup again chastised the government, this time for failing to produce key documents and records as required by the court, frustrating the judicial review process.</p> <p>"The 'administrative record' leaves the reader with the feeling that he is being led, blindfolded, along a carefully plotted path through a dense, unseen wood," Alsup wrote. "Here and there, he may hear a rustle in the trees, feel the dark silhouette of a towering form, or intuit some other hint at the forest beyond, but never is he afforded an unfettered view of the landscape through which he passes."</p> <h3 class="edTag">An order to set the record straight on performance</h3>
<p>While the relief Alsup ordered fell far short of what Beck, the fisheries biologist, had hoped for, she is glad that he has ordered agencies to make clear, in official paperwork and letters to fired employees, that their terminations had nothing to do with their performance.</p> <p>Alsup first ordered agencies to issue such a letter months ago, after finding that agencies had not actually assessed the individual performance of employees before firing them. He said without such letters, the employees may be dogged by questions over their job performance.</p> <p>"Countless high-performing employees… were terminated through a lie," he wrote in an April 18 order. "Termination under the false pretense of performance is an injury that will persist for the working life of each civil servant."</p> <p>In the months that followed, Beck received two letters from the government — first, a form letter, and later, a similar one that included her name. She calls them "the apology/non-apology."</p>
<p>The letters, indeed, say that she was not terminated because of her performance. The letters also say that the government is only providing such notice due to a court order, and that the government believes the order is "legally and factually erroneous" and therefore is appealing it.</p> <p>This time, Alsup has given federal agencies until Nov. 14 to reissue the letters, without all the disclaimers.</p> <p>"There is no need to lard the letters with such distractions," Alsup wrote.</p> <p>The government has appealed Alsup's final order to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Beck wonders if she'll forever have a mark on her record.</p> <p>"It's going to make it difficult to explain to future employers outside of the government and will absolutely make it difficult to get another federal job," she says.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Tensions are high in a Utah redistricting fight that didn't start with Trump</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>SALT LAKE CITY — Utah is getting closer to redrawing its congressional boundaries in an unusual mid-decade redistricting process, but it's not yet clear what that map will look like. In a heated committee meeting Wednesday, state lawmakers said they're considering a lot of options before deciding in October.</p> <p>Unlike other Republican-led states redistricting this year, Utah's new map is expected to give Democrats more of a chance at winning at least one of the state's four congressional districts, which could help Democrats in the race to control the U.S. House. State lawmakers were ordered to draw the new districts after a<strong> </strong>Utah judge ruled they had acted unconstitutionally in creating the map used in 2022.</p>
<h2 class="edTag">GOP "complying under protest" </h2> <p>The Legislature's Republican supermajority has made it clear they are not happy they had to go back to the drawing board and are complying under protest. The map must be approved by lawmakers and the court by Nov. 10 to be used in the 2026 midterms, according to Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson's <strong>o</strong>ffice.</p> <p>Utah's voided congressional map split the bluest area of the state, Salt Lake County, among the state's four districts, making four U.S. House seats safe for Republicans. That split was the biggest critique of the map, especially by county residents.</p> <p>All of the proposed new boundaries also divide the county, the most populous one in the state, but some only split it into two districts.</p> <p>Instead of advancing a single proposed map, the Legislature's redistricting committee said Wednesday it will let the public weigh in on any map that has been posted on its website before making a decision. That includes six maps commissioned by lawmakers, as well as proposals submitted by citizens.</p> <p>Lawmakers will choose from one of those maps, and only those maps, on Oct. 6. The map will go back to court for the judge to approve.</p> <h2 class="edTag">The national picture</h2> <p>Though Utah's redistricting originated from a local court case, it's playing out amid a redistricting race around the country set off by President Trump.</p>
<p>Usually, states redistrict early in the decade using new census numbers. In order to try to keep the GOP hold on the U.S. House and worried about midterm election losses, Trump has asked states led by Republicans to redistrict ahead of 2026 and help their party win seats.</p> <p>At Trump's urging, Texas passed a new map that could help Republicans win five more seats. To counter, California's Democratic leaders are asking voters to approve a new map that could help their party win five seats on November 4. Missouri has followed Trump's lead, with the Republican-led Legislature passing a map that could oust a Democratic congressman.</p> <p>Republican leaders in Indiana and Florida say they are working to follow Trump's call. They and other Republicans across the country say holding the U.S. House is key to maintaining Trump's agenda and preventing investigations of his administration that could be launched by a Democratic-led House.</p> <h2 class="edTag">The Utahns who sued</h2> <p>In 2018, Utah voters narrowly approved a ballot initiative known as Proposition 4 that, among other things, created an independent redistricting commission and prohibited gerrymandering. In 2020, the Legislature repealed and replaced the initiative with a law that weakened the commission's role and took out the prohibition on partisan gerrymandering.</p> <p>In 2022, the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and a handful of Utah voters sued the Legislature. They alleged that the Legislature violated Utahns' right to alter and reform their government and that the state's 2021 congressional map was gerrymandered to favor Republicans.</p> <p>In August of this year, a Utah judge ruled that the Legislature's override of Proposition 4 was unconstitutional. Because the state's 2021 congressional map was a product of that unconstitutional act, the judge said it had to go.</p> <p>Without valid maps, the Legislature has to redraw the boundaries in accordance with Proposition 4, which the judge also reinstated.</p>
<p>At the same time, GOP state lawmakers are trying to pass a bill that creates a single standardized method for testing "partisan symmetry" in congressional maps to determine if boundaries are fair.</p> <p>But Democrats on the committee argued that the test does not work in states like Utah where one party dominates in statewide elections.</p> <p>That proposed test is what most concerns Elizabeth Rasmussen, executive director of Better Boundaries, the group that backed Proposition 4.</p> <p>"I just see this as weaponization of the process to get a map they want," Rasmussen says.</p> <p>If the plaintiffs in the lawsuit have objections to the Legislature's map, they are also allowed to submit a proposal to the court. If that happens, there will be additional court hearings in late October to decide which map will be used.</p>

<p>For Ava Rimal, the options became clear: She and her husband could have a second kid, or move to the bigger house in a more upscale area. But they couldn't afford to do both.</p> <p>They chose the house.</p> <p>"I'd rather have one kid that I can give everything to than try to spread it thin between two children just for the sake of having two children," she says.</p> <p>Housing costs have risen sharply in recent years, leading people to make some hard choices.

They weren't excited about the local schools. A new plan came into focus when they visited Rimal's coworker in the South Jersey town of Collingswood, near Philadelphia.</p> <p>"It looked like a Hallmark movie. There were kids everywhere, and people singing," she recalls. "It was just nuts."</p>
<p>So they sold their Asbury Park home, and last June managed to buy a three-bedroom in Collingswood. But it stretched their budget. Their monthly payment is now almost $5,000, more than double what they were paying before. The mortgage rate on their old house was 3% — now it's 7.25%.</p> <p>"We bought the house with three bedrooms to kind of preserve the possibility of having another kid. But we didn't know that the interest rates were going to be so high or that we'd end up spending $100,000 more than we wanted to," Rimal says.</p> <p>When they ran the numbers on paying for daycare for a theoretical second child, plus their mortgage payment, it was just too expensive. They decided to be one and done.</p> <h2 class="edTag">Since the pandemic, affording a house has gotten harder for many</h2> <p>The pandemic created a watershed moment in the U.S. housing market.</p> <p>Many who bought a home before rates shot up in 2022 locked in super low interest rates they can keep forever. That means their housing costs may be significantly lower than those who bought later — but they can also feel locked in place, in a home that no longer fits their needs.</p> <p>Some who bought a home in the last few years, when both prices and mortgage rates have been high, feel squeezed by monthly payments that leave little cash left over. They stretched to afford a home — and they're still stretching.</p> <p>And many who haven't bought a home yet say they don't know when they'll ever be able to afford one. High rents make it hard to save for a down payment. Some people waited for prices or rates to fall so that they could jump in — and they're still waiting.</p> <p>The median monthly payment on a home bought in 2024 was $2,207, compared to $1,525 for a home bought in 2021, according to an analysis by Bankrate.</p>
<p>The median sales price for existing single-family homes rose 56% between February 2020 and July of this year, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. And high mortgage rates have further slashed affordability: Rates jumped from pandemic lows below 3% to above 7% earlier this year — though in recent weeks, they've dipped below 6.5%.</p>
<p>The high cost of housing is even causing some people to conclude they don't want kids at all.</p> <p>Chelsea Clouser is 29 and lives in Davis, Calif. She works in fundraising, and her husband teaches high school.</p> <p>When she was younger, Clouser was interested in having kids. "But then as I've gotten older and as I started working and kind of experienced how difficult it is to feel financially comfortable, it's just become less and less desirable for me," she says.</p> <p>Part of that calculation is the cost of housing. Clouser and her husband pay $2,400 a month to rent a one-bedroom apartment that sometimes already feels too small, with just their cat.</p> <p>Over the last six years, rents nationally rose 17%. Clouser's rent has gone up every year she's lived in Davis.</p> <p>"We want to eventually buy a house. And so if we had a kid, while we're renting, that would just be so impossible," she says.</p> <p>The cost of their rent — plus the fees for parking, storage, and a pet — has made saving up for a down payment difficult. Especially when the cost to buy is so high: Last month the typical home in Davis sold for $843,000.</p> <p>But even if housing were cheaper, Clouser says she would still have reservations. She worries about the economy and layoffs at work. She doesn't want the worry of providing enough opportunities for a child, too.</p> <p>As she and her husband talk through their goals, they weigh the benefits of having a child against how much harder it would make their financial situation. In the end, she says, it "just doesn't really seem worth it."</p>

<div class="article-title">8 walking and biking safety tips that just might save your life</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>You've heard of defensive driving — driving practices to help you stay safe on the road, like reducing your speed in bad weather or signaling before switching lanes. But what about defensive walking and cycling?</p> <p>They're a crucial part of pedestrian and cyclist safety, and more people should practice them, says Ryan Sharp, a transportation consultant with Alta, a transportation design firm.</p>
<p>"It means paying attention to your surroundings and having a constant awareness of the environment so you can anticipate potential hazards," he says. Because if you're a biker or a pedestrian and you get hit by a car, you're likely to be the more injured one.</p> <p>According to estimates from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, about 7,100 pedestrians were killed in traffic crashes in the U.S. in 2024. In recent years, more than 1,000 cyclists have been hit and killed annually.</p>
<p>But casualties are preventable. Sharp and Julia Kite-Laidlaw, a pedestrian and cyclist safety advocate with the National Safety Council, share their top do's and don'ts for walkers and bikers.</p>
<p><strong>1. DO look left, right and behind you. </strong>"Oftentimes the greatest hazards if you're a pedestrian trying to cross at an intersection are actually coming from behind you," Sharp says. </p> <p>So, look in all directions and turn around before walking or biking across a road. A driver trying to turn into the intersection may not see you in the crosswalk, for example, because they're looking at oncoming traffic. </p>
<p><strong>2. DO be visible and predictable. </strong>"Never assume that a driver sees you," Kite-Laidlaw says. More than three-quarters of pedestrian deaths happen after dark, and many people get struck and killed in places without sidewalks, where drivers may not expect people to be walking, according to a 2025 report from the Governors Highway Safety Association. </p>
<p>Always walk on the sidewalk or a walking path. If there is none, walk on the shoulder of the street against traffic so you can see oncoming cars and drivers can see you. </p> <p>If you're biking at night, put white lights at the front and red lights at the back of your bike so cars can see you. Even when you have the right of way, try to make eye contact with an oncoming driver or look for other indications that they see you, such as slowing down.  </p>
<p><strong>3. DO use sidewalks, bike paths and safe pedestrian crossings whenever possible. </strong>Most pedestrian and cyclist deaths "happen in between intersections," Kite-Laidlaw says, for instance, when dodging traffic across the middle of a street with no crosswalks. So stay in areas designed to keep bikers and walkers safe. </p>
<p>In some cities, the walk and bike signals turn green before the stoplights do. That gives pedestrians and bikers a few extra seconds of lead time, boosting their visibility and showing drivers they have the right of way. Design elements like curb extensions, which shorten the length of a crosswalk, lessen the amount of time a pedestrian is exposed on the road.  </p>
<p><strong>4. DON'T be distracted while biking or walking, especially while crossing the road. </strong>No listening to music or podcasts in your headphones or looking at your phone. You want to be able to hear the sounds of oncoming traffic and see what's happening around you.</p> <p><strong>5. DON'T ignore people on e-scooters and e-bikes</strong>. Because they're motorized and typically faster than someone on a bicycle, they may be a potential hazard for pedestrians and cyclists, Sharp says. Many cities and communities have yet to create the road infrastructure to accommodate these vehicles, so you may have to share space with them on sidewalks, bike paths and roads. </p> <p>If you feel nervous about crashing into an e-bike rider while walking down the road, "that's understandable," Sharp says. But keep in mind that "data has shown that there are not a lot of collisions between e-bike riders and pedestrians."</p>
<p><strong>6. DO wear your helmet correctly when cycling.</strong> It can protect you from head injuries in case of an accident.<strong> </strong>Make sure the helmet is covering your forehead, about one or two finger-widths above your eyebrow. The side-strap should form a V shape under and slightly in front of your ears on both sides of your face. Buckle and tighten your chin strap until it's snug. When your helmet is on, it shouldn't be rocking more than one inch side to side or front to back on your head.</p>
<p><strong>7. DO use turn signals when cycling </strong>to stay in constant communication with other cars, cyclists and pedestrians on the road. The easiest rules to remember are: left arm straight out for a left turn and right arm straight out for a right turn. You can also raise your left arm up in an L shape to show that you're turning right.</p> <p><strong>8. DON'T put yourself in danger just because you have the right of way.</strong> While drivers are responsible for driving safely, road safety is everyone's responsibility. "We have decades of data to show that expecting people to always act the right way [on the road] does not work," Sharp says. </p> <p>By taking ownership of your safety, you are helping to create a safe system, which protects everyone on the road. </p> <p><em>This story was edited by Meghan Keane.

<div class="article-title">Strict rules can foster calm classrooms. But some students pay the price</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Thirteen-year-old Levent goes to an Indianapolis middle school that's been celebrated for its test scores – but he's behind academically. His mother, Shania, believes that's because of how often he's been disciplined and suspended.</p> <p>Levent has ADHD, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, which his school, Paramount Englewood, has documented as a disability. School records show he has been disciplined for misbehavior like repeatedly disrespecting teachers and for leaving campus during the school day, raising safety<strong> </strong>concerns; he's been suspended for fighting, for "not following school rules" when he was already in trouble and for "horseplaying (fighting) in the restroom."</p>
<p>NPR is referring to both Levent and Shania, as well as the other student and parent in this story, by their middle names because the article describes the students' disabilities and how they have been disciplined at school.</p> <p>It often feels to Levent, who is in eighth grade, like he's being unfairly punished. Take an incident last school year, when he was suspended for wrestling with a classmate.</p> <p>"It felt like I was getting suspended for just playing around with my friend," Levent says.</p> <p>To his mom, when her son gets suspended from school and sent home, it feels like the school is ignoring his disability. Shania says ADHD makes Levent impulsive – and contributes to many of the incidents that get him suspended.</p> <p>"Why is he getting in trouble for what ADHD looks like?" she asks.</p> <p>In records, school staff have said they don't believe all of Levent's misbehavior is related to his disability.</p> <p>Nationwide, students with disabilities are suspended at far higher rates than their non-disabled peers.</p> <p>Levent's school is part of a charter network that stands out in Indiana: An NPR analysis of 2024-25 state data found that the system, Paramount Schools of Excellence, suspended students with disabilities about three times as often as the state average.</p>
<p>Paramount's supporters, including many parents, have praised the network for calm classrooms and strong academic performance, especially among students from low-income families and students of color.</p> <p>But several current and former Paramount parents told NPR that some students – especially those with disabilities – struggle to follow the rules that foster those quiet classrooms.</p> <p>"It's either you fit this mold or you don't," Shania says. "And if you don't, then we're going to suspend, suspend, suspend."</p> <h3 class="edTag">"Calm" hallways and very high suspension rates</h3> <p>Paramount Schools of Excellence is a growing charter network in Indiana. As a K-8 charter system, its campuses are privately managed but publicly funded and free to attend.</p> <p>When Paramount CEO Tommy Reddicks describes his schools, one of the first words he uses is calm. The halls are quiet. In classrooms, students are focused on school work. "We're very much a calm, collected school environment rather than a kind of really jazz you up cheerleading type of environment," he says.</p>
<p>Federal data shows Indiana schools rely on exclusionary discipline like out-of-school suspension more than schools in most other states. And Paramount's suspension rates surpass Indiana's state averages among students with and without disabilities.</p> <p>For every 100 students in general education in the Paramount system, there were about 45 suspensions, according to an NPR analysis of state data from the 2024-25 school year. The statewide average was 10.</p> <p>For every 100 children receiving special education services, there were about 73<strong> </strong>suspensions. The statewide average was 22.</p> <p>This data reflects the total number of suspensions, not the number of students suspended.</p> <p>Reddicks attributes the network's high suspension rates in part to its structured approach, which he believes protects the learning environment and ultimately benefits students, including those with disabilities.</p> <p>"You know, a lot of our special education incidents typically involve safety of others or safety of the students in question," Reddicks explains.</p>
<p>Reddicks says, and state data confirms, that Paramount schools reduced suspensions among students with disabilities during the 2024-25 school year.</p> <p>He says the decline reflects both the maturing of campuses that opened in recent years and that enrolled first-time Paramount students, as well as the network's focus on training staff to reduce suspensions.</p> <p>When suspensions do happen, Reddicks says he doesn't believe they hold students back.</p> <p>"We know that, in our more structured system, students with suspensions still perform very well and typically outperform state averages," he says.</p> <p>Reddicks shared data from two Paramount schools. It showed students who have been suspended do outperform state averages on standardized tests, but only in some grades. He did not provide data for the network's other campuses, including Paramount Englewood.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Why some families of students with disabilities are drawn to Paramount</h3> <p>For some parents, the discipline policies that help foster Paramount's quiet classrooms are a selling point. It's one reason Nicol, who has sent five children to a Paramount school, kept driving her family there even after she moved across town.</p> <p>"I like that they're strict," Nicol says. "You walk into Paramount, their kids are sitting at the desk. Their kids are doing what needs to be done."</p> <p>Even when her own children have been suspended, Nicol has seen some benefit.</p> <p>Her 12-year-old son, Leon, has autism and other disabilities. Last year, Leon's behavior spiraled after his grandfather died, Nicol says. He began cussing and throwing objects in class. Nicol says that not every suspension he received was necessary but that he should be suspended when he pushes or fights with other students.</p> <p>"He does need to be held accountable," she says. "Because I don't want to say, 'Oh, well, let's let [Leon] get by with this because he has autism.'"</p> <p>Overall, Nicol says educators at Paramount have worked hard to meet Leon's needs. She trusts Paramount in part because she believes her two oldest children's experience there set them up to succeed in high school.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">The costs of missing school</h3> <p>Some experts say that when schools suspend students with disabilities, it's little more than a Band-Aid that gives educators a break from misbehavior and a chance to think through how to respond.</p>
<p>"I would say suspension doesn't fix much," says Federico Waitoller, a professor of special education at the University of Illinois Chicago. Waitoller says suspensions don't help students with disabilities learn and grow.</p> <p>"You're not teaching anything, right?" says Waitoller, a former special educator. "You're saying, 'Don't do this.' But you're not telling the student what to do, how to do it — and give them the supports to do it."</p> <p>Levent's mother, Shania, says that she's seen some of his difficult behavior at home and that she would like him to learn to control his impulses — to stop horseplaying and arguing when adults ask him to do something.</p> <p>But Shania says suspensions do little to teach her son how to behave. And the missed days of school add up. Records show Levent's school suspended him for at least 10 days last school year. Then, after Levent walked off campus a few weeks before the end of the year, he had to spend most of the final days of school at home, where he received about an hour of remote instruction a day, according to school records.</p> <p>All that missed school has taken a toll, Shania says.</p> <p>"I don't want him to get even further behind," she says. "Because again, this is a kid that's behind."</p> <p>Levent started his final year of middle school in August – and already Shania is frustrated by how the school is handling his behavior. She says she's considering pulling him out.</p>

<div class="article-title">A question of intent: Is what's happening in Gaza genocide?</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>As world leaders gather in New York this week for the U.N. General Assembly, a growing number of experts are calling on diplomats to address what they describe as genocide and famine in Gaza.</p> <p>Israel strongly rejects accusations that it is guilty of genocide in its nearly two-year campaign in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed nearly 1,200 people, with another 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.</p> <p>The Israeli military campaign that followed has killed more than 64,000 people, including more than 18,000 children, according to Gaza health authorities. Almost all of Gaza's estimated 2 million residents have been forced to flee their homes, often multiple times. Many Palestinians, as well as rights groups and some prominent Americans, have said Israel is responsible for genocide in the enclave.</p>
<p>In the United States, the word has started to enter the public discourse. Polls show Democrats and independents are increasingly likely to describe Israel's actions as genocide, even as Republican views have remained steady.</p> <p>To understand what the term means and how it has become such a battleground, NPR spoke with historians, legal scholars, military analysts and people living through the war. The scholars say it's difficult to hold states legally responsible for any crimes. And some pointed to a thornier issue: the burden of proving that Israel's war in Gaza is motivated by "genocidal intent."</p> <h3 class="edTag">What does genocide mean?</h3>
<p>The term "genocide" was introduced in 1944 by Polish Jewish lawyer Raphael Lemkin to describe the extermination of European Jews during the Holocaust. Lemkin's early exposure to the history of Ottoman attacks on Armenians and the pogroms in Poland was instrumental in shaping his belief that groups needed protection under international law.</p> <p>In 1948, four years later, the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, often called the Genocide Convention, defining genocide as "any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:</p>
<p>(a) Killing members of the group;</p> <p>(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;</p> <p>(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;</p> <p>(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;</p> <p>(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group."</p> <p>Both Israel and the U.S. have ratified the convention — Israel in 1950 and the U.S. in 1988.</p> <h3 class="edTag">How are countries tried for genocide in courts?</h3>
<p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, Netherlands, handles disputes between countries, including under the Genocide Convention. A separate court, the International Criminal Court, entered into force in 2002 to prosecute individuals for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. But it has no jurisdiction over countries that haven't joined, among them the U.S., Israel, Myanmar and China. Outside the courts, the U.N. Security Council can authorize the protection of civilians, but that power is often paralyzed by the veto powers of the council's five permanent members.</p> <p>In Rwanda, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ruled that the 1994 mass killings of the Tutsi minority constituted genocide, and it convicted several political and military leaders for organizing and inciting it. In the war following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, the ICJ found that genocide occurred in 1995 in Srebrenica, where around 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed by a Serbian-aligned force. But the court did not hold Serbia directly responsible for committing genocide, only for failing to prevent it.</p> <p>The U.S. has also formally recognized genocides against Armenians and Darfuris. Then-President Barack Obama labeled ISIS's actions genocide, and President Trump<strong> </strong>used the term to describe the situation facing white South Africans.</p> <p>Gambia brought a still-ongoing case against Myanmar to the ICJ in 2019, accusing it of genocide over a military campaign that forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee. The U.K. and other states argued in that case that intent could be inferred from the mass displacement and harm to children. Myanmar claims it was targeting terrorists, but the court rejected its bid to throw out the case and is now weighing it on the merits.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Why is "intent" in genocide cases hard to prove?</h3> <p>Genocide is considered the hardest crime to prove in court.</p> <p>The "intent" requirement makes it distinct, said Shannon Fyfe, a legal scholar at Washington and Lee University.</p> <p>"Proving intent tends to be the most difficult part of any criminal case," she said. "The ICJ says genocidal intent must be the only reasonable inference from the available evidence."</p> <p>The Genocide Convention's drafters added "as such" to require that acts be carried out because of who the group is, not just to achieve another goal — something judges struggle to assess.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Gaza: Early warnings, early rejections</h3>
<p>Just days after Israel began its bombing campaign in Gaza, Raz Segal, an Israeli-American scholar of Jewish history and Holocaust and genocide studies, wrote that it represented a "textbook case of genocide."</p> <p>In particular, Segal pointed to what he viewed as a deliberate intent to destroy, citing then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's order to impose a siege on the enclave.</p> <p>Shortly after he publicly accused Israel of genocide in Gaza, the University of Minnesota rescinded its offer for him to lead the school's Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies.</p>
<p>"People ask me, 'Wasn't it too soon on Oct. 13?' No. The convention is activated by the risk of genocide, not just its occurrence. That's the whole point of prevention. That's the meaning of 'Never Again,'" Segal told NPR, referencing a common saying calling for the Holocaust to never be repeated.</p> <p>He added that denying Israel was committing any war crimes, including genocide, allowed for Israel's actions to be justified.</p> <p>"As if the Hamas-led massacres that day were not terrible enough, Israel and its allies, primarily the United States, including President Biden, immediately started circulating this atrocity propaganda," he said. "The lies and fabrications — like the false claim about beheaded babies — continuously shifted the focus not to Israeli violence but to the alleged barbarity of the Palestinians, to the point where they were seen as a danger that no international law should apply to."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">When did a Palestinian "genocide" become a legal claim? A timeline</h3> <p>In November 2023, the Biden administration was named in a federal lawsuit filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights and the law firm Van Der Hout LLP on behalf of Palestinian individuals and the human rights organizations Al-Haq and Defense for Children International-Palestine, along with eight other plaintiffs.</p> <p>The suit alleged that the "unfolding genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza has so far been made possible because of the unconditional support" of President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.</p> <p>Laila Elhaddad, a Palestinian American author from Gaza and one of the plaintiffs, went to court on Jan. 26, 2024, and later told NPR that she knew it was a long shot, but she felt "uniquely obligated, as an American whose taxes were partly financing the killing of my family members," to take legal action.</p> <p>She added, "We as Palestinians understood from the start the intent to genocide. Israeli leaders spelled out exactly what they planned to do and then carried it out. We never expected it to go this far. But with no one to stop Netanyahu and no red lines in place, it was no surprise that he felt emboldened to destroy everything."</p> <p>On Jan. 31, 2024, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White wrote that he found indications that "the ongoing military siege in Gaza is intended to eradicate a whole people and therefore plausibly falls within the international prohibition against genocide." Still, White dismissed the case in 2024, saying the court could not intervene in U.S. foreign policy decisions.</p> <p>For Elhaddad, the ruling was both validating and bitter.</p> <p>"It was cathartic," she said, to testify about what her family had endured. But outside the courtroom, she felt silenced. "Even using the word 'genocide' in opinion pieces was a no from editors I worked with."</p>
<p>The hearing of Elhaddad's case, along with those of the other plaintiffs, began just hours after the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that it is plausible that Israel has violated the terms of the Genocide Convention in the war in Gaza, in a case brought forward by South Africa. The proceedings remain ongoing and have drawn support from more than 25 countries.</p> <p>In its case against Israel, South Africa devotes nine pages to claims of genocidal incitement. The filing says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu twice referred to the biblical story of Amalek, saying: "Remember what Amalek has done to you, says our holy Bible. We remember." He mentioned Amalek again in a letter to Israeli soldiers and officers.</p> <p>In the Hebrew Bible, Amalek is a figure who tried to destroy the Jewish people. The reference has historically been used by the Israeli far right to justify killing Palestinians.</p>
<p>Amnesty International was the first major international organization to accuse Israel of carrying out genocide in Gaza. Amnesty International Israel, which publicly disputed the genocide allegation in rare dissent from the global rights group, was later suspended for breaking with that conclusion. Human Rights Watch, B'Tselem, Doctors Without Borders and Physicians for Human Rights–Israel have also accused Israel of committing genocide. Separately, a U.N. commission concluded that Israel has committed four of the five genocidal acts outlined in the Genocide Convention. While such findings carry no enforcement power, they could influence the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Arguments against calling it a genocide</h3>
<p>Israel's defense against the genocide case brought by South Africa rests on two claims: that it lacks genocidal intent and that its actions target legitimate military objectives. It also argues that the case reflects bias, citing a lack of trust in the U.N. and other international bodies.</p> <p>Israel told the court it is fighting a legitimate war of self-defense against Hamas. The Israeli legal team said South Africa's accusations that Israel has intent to destroy the Palestinian people in Gaza are based on comments by Israeli officials that have been taken out of context and are based only on "random assertions" in order to show genocidal intent.</p>
<p>In an interview with NPR's<em> Morning Edition</em>, Amos Yadlin, the former head of Israeli military intelligence, called the charge of genocide "nonsense," saying that the goal is to destroy Hamas, not Palestinians.</p> <p>Eran Shamir-Borer, director of the Israel Democracy Institute's Center for Security and Democracy and former head of the Israel Defense Forces' international law division, defended the legality of Israel's campaign in an email to NPR:</p> <p>"Available evidence regarding Israel's policies and conduct in the war in Gaza – whether it relies on statements by Israeli officials or on Israel's conduct on the ground – does not suggest that such standards are even close to being met," he said, adding that "jumping straight to the genocide claim not only empties the sacred term of its meaning; it also undermines other categories of potential violations of the law."</p> <p>John Spencer, a retired U.S. Army officer who has advised the Israeli military, told <em>Morning Edition</em><em> </em>that Israel is not engaged in genocide and cited "the mountain of evidence of what Israel is doing to preserve infrastructure, civilian life, to provide services."</p> <p>At times during the war, Israel has completely blocked aid from entering Gaza, citing reasons such as pressuring Hamas to surrender and accusing the group of seizing humanitarian supplies. Under pressure from the United States, Israel has allowed some aid into the territory, but humanitarian organizations say the conditions imposed by Israel severely limit the amount that can reach civilians. </p> <p>Israeli officials have not provided public evidence to support their claim that Hamas systematically steals aid. Unlike in previous Gaza conflicts, international journalists are not permitted access to Gaza unless they are embedded with the Israeli military.</p> <p>The U.S. government, under Biden and now under Trump, has firmly supported Israel's military actions, going well beyond diplomatic statements and even imposing sanctions on International Criminal Court judges and prosecutors, U.N. official Francesca Albanese and nongovernmental human rights organizations like Al-Haq.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in 2023, the U.S. government has sold at least $30 billion in weapons to Israel, delivered more than 90,000 tons of weapons and provided the Israeli government with $12.5 billion in funds to purchase weapons.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Legal definitions and political justifications</h3>
<p>As scholars grapple with whether the war in Gaza is genocide, they return to the question of intent.</p> <p>Fyfe, the Washington and Lee University legal scholar, said, "Genocide can occur within or outside of war. But it is never permissible, even if the war itself is. So war is not a defense. If the legal elements are met, they are met, regardless of other circumstances."</p> <p>On intent, she said, "If a military leader intends to gain land and removing a group is the only way to do it, that's not necessarily genocide. But if the only reasonable inference from a siege or campaign is that the group itself is being destroyed as such, then that is genocidal intent."</p> <p>In Gaza, she said, that distinction has blurred.</p> <p>"There are statements from Israeli officials that suggest intent to destroy, but it's not always clear if they mean Hamas or Gazans," she said. "But I do not think it is reasonable to claim that the siege is a military objective, given that Hamas is already crippled."</p> <p>"So it may be that the only reasonable inference that can be made about the siege is that it reflects genocidal intent. Objective behavior can, and may here, stand in for objective statements."</p> <p>"Each Israeli strike may be a war crime, but serially they've destroyed more than 70% of Gaza's buildings and killed tens of thousands, mainly civilians," said A. Dirk Moses, Spitzer professor of international relations at City College of New York and editor of the <em>Journal of Genocide Research</em>. "In no way can this outcome be seen as collateral."</p>
<p>He also said that it is often forgotten that the Genocide Convention includes the destruction of a group "in whole or in part." "In Srebrenica, 'only' 8,000 men and boys were killed, but they were deemed a substantial part of the Bosnian population. That was enough for a genocide ruling."</p> <p>Sonia Boulos, a professor of international human rights law at Nebrija University in Spain, argued that Israel's justification — that Hamas uses civilians as human shields — has functioned to deny Palestinians civilian status altogether.</p> <p>"Even if one were to accept the premise that Hamas uses civilians as human shields, that fact does not alter the genocidal nature of rhetoric that dehumanizes Palestinians as 'human animals,' calls for the complete destruction of Gaza or invokes biblical references to Amalek," she said.</p> <p>"Such utterances are not only genocidal in nature — they help explain the apocalyptic reality currently unfolding in Gaza," Boulos said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">What led two scholars to change their minds about Gaza?</h3>
<p>Some scholars who initially rejected or avoided the term "genocide" have since shifted their stance, citing mass civilian killings, widespread destruction and restrictions on humanitarian aid as key reasons for their change.</p>
<p>Omer Bartov, an Israeli-born genocide scholar and military veteran, was among those who reconsidered his position. "There were people who expected that there would be genocide right away. There are people who think that Israel has always been involved in genocide. And I did not think that," he said in a <em>Morning Edition</em> interview. But he added that he found evidence and came to his conclusion in May 2024. "I asked myself: What is actually the goal of what the [Israel Defense Forces] is doing? Is it what it said — to destroy Hamas and to release the hostages? Or is it something else?"</p> <p>In May 2024, nearly 1 million Palestinians were displaced from the southern city of Rafah and northern Gaza after Israeli forces issued evacuation orders. By August of that year, Rafah, once home to about 275,000 people, had been reduced to a desolate landscape of rubble. Many of those who fled south to areas deemed "safe" from the heavy bombardment in the north found little to no protection there.</p> <p>Dov Waxman, a British-American professor of Israel studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, has also revised his stance after once publicly disputing Raz Segal's early claim that Israel was engaged in genocide. As of this writing, he is the only U.S.-based scholar in the field of Israel studies — an academic discipline focused on the history, politics and culture of contemporary Israel — to have done so publicly.</p> <p>"I struggled to accept the possibility that Jews, the victims of genocide, could become perpetrators of genocide," Waxman said.</p> <p>"As the months passed and the death and destruction mounted, I understood why experts were calling it genocide, but I still wasn't convinced," Waxman said, adding that his turning point came in March 2025, when Israel broke a ceasefire, cut off humanitarian aid and resumed its offensive.</p>
<p><strong>"</strong>Deliberately making it impossible for Palestinians to live as a group in Gaza crosses the legal threshold for genocide," Waxman said.</p> <p>Israeli officials have considered plans for pushing Palestinians out of Gaza since the early days of the war, and a proposal by Trump to build a "Riviera" in Gaza has added momentum.</p> <h3 class="edTag">How the war in Gaza is changing the discourse about genocide </h3>
<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said on Sept. 17 that Israel's actions in Gaza constitute a genocide, marking the first time the longtime senator has used the term to describe the war.  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have also called it genocide.</p> <p>Cultural figures such as YouTuber Ms. Rachel, comedian Theo Von — who has interviewed Trump and built a MAGA-friendly following — and Joe Rogan, the world's most popular podcaster, have also used the term.</p>
<p>David Simon, director of the Genocide Studies Program at Yale University, says the word's use itself has surged in the public discourse. He links the rise to a broader awareness sparked first by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and again by images of Gaza's famine and destruction.</p> <p>"Some of this may be driven by the images and reporting on the famine, which paint a much more vivid picture of the threat to human life than does mere statistics. But also, people considering the element of 'intent to destroy' that is part of the U.N. definition of genocide seem to find it more consistently now, in the context of a man-made famine, than they did with respect to the previous elements of conflict, which at least from a distance read more as 'war.'"</p> <p>In an August 2025 <em>Economist/</em>YouGov poll, 69% of Democrats and 44% of independents said that Israel was committing genocide against Palestinian civilians. In a January 2024 survey from the same pollsters, only 45% of Democrats and 29% of independents said Israel was committing genocide. The percentage of Republicans who thought that genocide was being committed against Palestinians was unchanged at 17%.</p> <p>In Israel, only a minority of the population shares that view.</p> <p>A survey conducted in March 2025 and the subject of an essay in <em>Haaretz</em> newspaper found that 82% of Jewish Israelis polled backed the expulsion of Gazans and that nearly half, 47%, said they supported killing all Palestinians in "enemy cities captured by the Israeli army."</p> <p>Martin Shaw, a historical sociologist and the author of <em>What Is Genocide? </em>and<em> The New Age of Genocide: Intellectual and Political Challenges After Gaza</em>, says that the public discourse reveals how "some people still think that only events like the Holocaust count as genocide, which no expert would argue. Gaza is different from the Holocaust, but it is still a deliberate attempt to destroy a people, which is the meaning of genocide."</p> <p>Shaw, who wrote early in the war that Hamas' killings of Israeli civilians constituted "genocidal massacres" and who now believes Gaza is experiencing a genocide, said there is a new dynamic in how the public understanding of the word is being shaped. Israel, he said, believed that by banning international journalists from entering Gaza, "it could prevent the world from seeing its atrocities."</p>
<p>"It has tried to kill local Palestinian journalists," he said, "but so many ordinary people in Gaza have filmed what Israel is doing that the world has seen it nevertheless."</p> <p>Israel denies deliberately targeting journalists. International news agencies have criticized past Israeli investigations into its military, stating in a recent joint letter following Israeli strikes that killed five journalists in Gaza that such investigations "rarely result in clarity and action."</p> <p>The Committee to Protect Journalists says the war in Gaza is the deadliest conflict for journalists since it started gathering data in 1992.</p>
<p>Simon, of Yale University, observes that media blackouts are not new. But in the case of Gaza, "having social media serve as the source of information has made it much harder to agree on the basic understanding of what's actually been going on, and [has] added more to the algorithmic amplification that contributed to the acute polarization over the past two years."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Beyond debates</h3>
<p>For many Palestinians, the public debates over the word are not just an abstract concept.</p> <p>Elhaddad told NPR that since the 2023 lawsuit against the Biden administration — at which time at least 86 of her relatives had been killed — Israeli airstrikes, drones and shootings at the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's food distribution sites have raised the death toll on her mother's side to 200. She shared a spreadsheet detailing the deaths, including notes when she was able to get them.</p> <p>"It felt like the ground was moving beneath my feet, as if everything that made my parents' home familiar was being systematically erased," said Elhaddad.</p> <p>Now that more prominent figures of different political persuasions have slowly begun to call Israel's actions in Gaza a "genocide," Elhaddad said, she has felt recognition of her own story.</p> <p>"The tragedy is that it took over 60,000 Palestinian bodies and a full-blown starvation to reach this conclusion," she said.</p> <p><em>This story was edited by Tony Cavin, Nishant Dahiya, James Hider.

<div class="article-title">White House threatens layoffs -- not furloughs -- if the government shuts down</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>If the government shuts down on Oct. 1, the White House said it will look for ways to use the funding dispute to permanently eliminate some federal workers, rather than just temporarily send them home on unpaid leave.</p>
<p>This proposed "reduction in force" — outlined in a memo obtained by NPR on Wednesday — would be a significant shift from past government shutdowns, when employees have been temporarily furloughed until a budget deal is reached.</p> <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget told agency heads that a funding lapse would give the administration the chance to issue "reduction in force" (RIF) notices to people who work on programs that are "not consistent with the president's priorities." The plans were first reported by Politico.</p>
<p>It's the latest push by President Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, to aggressively cut government programs created and funded by Congress, including foreign aid, spending on electric vehicle charging stations, and funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Vought has argued that presidents – rather than Congress – have considerable power to control more spending, Democrats and the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) have disagreed.</p> <p>House Republicans have passed a bill that would fund the government at current levels through Nov. 21. But in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to pass the bill, Democrats have insisted on adding a number of measures, including subsidies for Affordable Care Act insurance premiums. They are set to expire, hitting Americans who buy insurance on the Obamacare exchanges with shocking price increases this year.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Schumer calls the memo 'an attempt at intimidation'</h3> <p>Democratic leaders had been set to sit down with Trump on Thursday to talk about the issues, but Trump canceled the meeting, saying Democrats were making "unserious and ridiculous demands."</p> <p>The White House said it supports the bill passed by House Republicans. In the memo, the OMB said its layoff notices could be avoided if Democrats decide to support the bill.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the memo "an attempt at intimidation" in a statement released late Wednesday night.</p> <p>"This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government," Schumer wrote. "These unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today."</p> <p>Congressional Democrats are under intense pressure from their voters to stand up to Trump after they provided the votes to pass a six-month spending bill in March.</p>
<p>At the time, Schumer said that a shutdown would give Trump the power to pick and choose what departments and agencies to reopen.</p> <p>The plan for layoff notices is a break from the Trump administration's approach during his first term. In 2018, Trump refused to sign a bipartisan stopgap government funding bill because it didn't include funding for his border wall, sparking a 35-day shutdown, the longest on record. But the administration worked to reduce the pain from the shutdown by keeping as much of the government open as possible, and pledging to give furloughed workers back pay as quickly as possible.</p>

<div class="article-title">For the first time in nearly 6 decades, a Syrian president steps up to speak at the U.N.</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>UNITED NATIONS — Turning the page on decades of distance, Syria's president addressed the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, marking the first time any president from his country has done so in almost 60 years. As he spoke, hundreds of people gathered in front of giant screens in Syrian cities and towns to witness the speech while waving the country's flags.</p>
<p>Ahmad al-Sharaa said Syria is returning to the international community after six decades of dictatorship that killed 1 million people and tortured hundreds of thousands. "Syria is reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world," he told the assembly's annual gathering of world leaders.</p> <p>Al-Sharaa became the first Syrian head of state to speak at the United Nations since Noureddine Attasi gave a speech in 1967 shortly after the Arab-Israeli war, during which Damascus lost control of the Golan Heights that Israel later annexed in 1981.</p>
<p>Since the Assad family came to power in Syria in 1970 in a bloodless coup that overthrew Attasi, relations with the United States have been mostly cold as Damascus was an ally of the former Soviet Union. Over the past decades, it was foreign ministers of Syria who represented the country at the U.N. General Assembly.</p> <h3 class="edTag">An appearance after the collapse of the Assad family's regime</h3> <p>The Assad family dynasty's autocratic, repressive 54-year rule in Syria abruptly collapsed in December, when then-President Bashar Assad was ousted in a lightning insurgent offensive led by al-Sharaa. Assad's fall marked a major shift in the 14-year civil war.</p> <p>Al-Sharaa blasted Israel in his speech saying that it did not stop its threats to his country since the fall of Assad adding that its policies "contradict with the international community's support to Syria and its people" in what endangers the region and could make enter conflicts that no one know how they could end.</p> <p>Negotiations have been underway for a security deal that al-Sharaa has said he hopes will bring about a withdrawal of Israeli forces and return to a 1974 disengagement agreement. While al-Sharaa said last week that a deal could be reached in a matter of days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in remarks Sunday appeared to downplay the odds of a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Later Wednesday, Netanyahu's office said in a statement that negotiations are underway with Syria adding that their conclusion "involves ensuring Israel's interests, which include, among other things, the demilitarization of southwestern Syria and maintaining the safety and security of the Druze in Syria."</p>
<p>Since assuming power, al-Sharaa has preached coexistence and sought to reassure Syria's minority communities, but the country has been threatened by outbreaks of sectarian violence that left hundreds dead earlier this year. Gunmen affiliated with the new government were also accused of atrocities against civilians from the Druze and Alawite religious minorities in southern Syria's Sweida province and the coastal region.</p> <p>Al-Sharaa said in his speech that the Syrian state has worked on forming fact-finding missions and gave the United Nations the right to investigate the killings that took place this year adding: "I promise to bring anyone whose hands are tainted with the blood of Syrian people to justice."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">The fight against drugs has progressed</h3> <p>Al-Sharaa said that the new authorities in Syria have destroyed the drugs business that Assad used to fund his government as it was under harsh Western sanctions that, along with the war, paralyzed the economy. Assad's fall revealed industrial-scale manufacturing facilities of the amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon, also known as fenethylline, which experts say fed a $10 billion annual global trade in the highly addictive drug.</p> <p>Over the past months, Syrian authorities have closed Captagon factories in different parts of Syria part of their campaign to end the illegal trade.</p> <p>Al-Sharaa urged Western countries to lift the sanctions that were imposed on Assad, saying, "We call for lifting them completely so that they are not a tool to shackle the Syrian people."</p>
<p>President Trump met with al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia in May and announced that he would lift decades of sanctions imposed on Syria under the Assad's rule. He followed through by ordering a large swath of sanctions lifted or waived.</p>
<p>However, the most stringent sanctions were imposed by Congress under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act passed in 2019 and will require a congressional vote to permanently remove them.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters outside the U.N. building after giving his speech, al-Sharaa said that he hopes that the sanctions would eventually be lifted adding that the majority of Congress members are for lifting the Congress under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act.</p> <p>"Syria does not wish the pain it passed through for anyone. We are among the most people who feel the suffering of war and destruction," al-Sharaa said. "Therefore we support the people of Gaza."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Syrian divisions manifest in New York</h3> <p>In Damascus, cheering crowds gathered in the central Umayyad Square to celebrate al-Sharaa's speech. At Dag Hammarskjöld Plaza square in New York, members of the Syrian diaspora faced off in dueling demonstrations, one in support of the new authorities in Damascus and one against.</p>
<p>Pro-government demonstrators hoisted the three-starred "revolution flag" that has now become the official flag of Syria. On the other side, many lifted the five-color Druze flag. Some shouted and cursed at each other across the barricades.</p> <p>On the Druze side, Farah Taki, originally from Sweida, said her aunts there were displaced by the recent violence and she had come from Chicago to protest al-Sharaa's visit.</p> <p>"It's disgrace that New York is welcoming an ex-Qaida member at the U.N., and allowing him even to speak," she said. The insurgent group that al-Sharaa formerly led was once affiliated with al-Qaida but later cut ties.</p>
<p>On the other side of the barricades, Dina Keenawari, a Syrian American originally from Damascus, had come from Florida to show her support for al-Sharaa.</p> <p>"We've lived under tyranny for the past 50 years, and now we're turning a new chapter and we're looking forward," she said. "And we're proud of him."</p>

<div class="article-title">Victim's widow files the first lawsuit after January's D.C.-area midair crash</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>WASHINGTON — Casey Crafton was one of 60 passengers who were killed when an American Airlines regional jet collided with a U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopter near Washington, D.C. in January.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, his wife Rachel Crafton became the first family member to file a wrongful death lawsuit.</p> <p>"Casey was a devoted father and husband, and we built a beautiful life together," Rachel Crafton said in prepared remarks. "Our lives were shattered in a moment, and the grief has been unimaginable."</p> <p>The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, names American Airlines and PSA Airlines, the regional carrier that operated the flight, as defendants, along with the federal government. It's the first of what are expected to be dozens of similar suits.</p>
<p>A total of 67 people, including the crew of the helicopter and the regional jet, died in the collision near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, making it the deadliest air traffic disaster in the U.S. in decades. On Jan. 29., the jet had been cleared to land when the Army helicopter, which was on a nighttime training mission, struck the plane at an altitude of 278 feet. Both aircraft plunged into the Potomac River.</p> <p>Federal investigators at the National Transportation Safety Board held a three-day hearing on the collision in August. So far, that investigation has revealed problems with the altimeters in the Army helicopter, which gave incorrect altitude readouts to the Black Hawk pilots. There were also serious concerns about numerous near misses at the airport that predated the crash.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs argue that American Airlines should be held liable, as well.</p> <p>"The crash of American Eagle 5342 was predictable, it was preventable, and caused the needless loss of 67 lives on that fateful evening," said Robert Clifford, a lawyer representing the Crafton family, at a press conference in Washington.</p> <p>Clifford argues that the airline did not adequately train its crew on how to safely navigate congestion around DCA, and that its efforts to maximize the number of flights in and out of the airport amount to "corporate negligence."</p>
<p>American Airlines immediately pushed back.</p> <p>"American has a strong track record of putting the safety of our customers and team members above everything else," the company said in a statement. "We continue to support the ongoing NTSB investigation and will defend American and PSA Airlines against any legal action claiming the airline caused or contributed to this accident."</p>
<p>Several dozen family members of other crash victims also attended the press conference to show their support for the Crafton family.</p> <p>"Many of us have been asked whether we dread the idea of rehashing the worst days of our lives in court," said Doug Lane, whose wife Christine Conrad Lane and son Spencer Seojin Lane died in the collision. "We are here to see this process through, however long it takes, to ensure that our family members have a lasting legacy that makes the world safer for everyone who flies."</p>
