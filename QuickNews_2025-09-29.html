<div class="article-title">US could lose next major war due to Pentagon's 'broken' acquisition system</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>During World War II, the United States unleashed free market mavericks to solve our hardest industrial challenges and build a war machine that proved to be the engine for the Allies’ victory. This machine served us well through the Cold War, but in the past 30 years, it stalled.</p><p>Today, we face a risk of losing our next major war, not for lack of courage or ingenuity, but because of a broken defense acquisition system riddled with bureaucratic sclerosis.</p><p>Americans constantly read headlines about growing threats and potential conflicts as our adversaries innovate rapidly. Meanwhile, our defense industrial base is tied down by regulations built for a bygone era.</p><p>A 2024 congressional report makes clear America is facing its most serious global threats since the Second World War, and we are woefully unprepared to meet the demands of a great power conflict.</p><p>While China spent two decades growing its military, the United States lost its industrial edge, surrendered risk tolerance and emphasized process over outcomes. The result is a constrained system that produces too little material, too slowly and in decreasing quality.</p><p>Reports suggest the U.S. could exhaust our long-range, anti-ship missile supply in as little as a week of conflict with China. The Pentagon takes almost 12 years to deliver the first version of a new weapons system. Our troops even use decades-old radio systems – what if you used a decades-old cellphone?</p><p>Years of rigid regulations have dwindled our once formidable, agile industrial base into a lumbering bureaucracy that fails to meet the needs of our warfighters and our national security interests.</p><p>Reforming the way we develop, produce and deploy weapons in the 21st century is not an option; it’s an imperative.</p><p>To maintain agility and deterrence, we must supercharge our military industrial base by incentivizing the best private sector actors to invest in defense technology and manufacturing. Let them, not the government, drive the process to innovate, iterate and scale the latest capabilities. We don’t need more companies making dating apps and yoga pants; we need businesses built to secure America’s future.</p><p>Forty years ago, many of America’s greatest companies had healthy defense <i>and</i> commercial divisions which created cross-pollination between commercial and government innovation. Now, they are beholden to a byzantine contracting structure that, throughout the 1990s, boiled our defense industrial base down to a small sect of companies that only contract with the government and deters commercial companies from participating in defense industry initiatives.</p><p>That’s why we support the Dynamic Tech Defense Reform initiative in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to break inertia, overhaul the incentive structure that favors a handful of entrenched contractors, and empower new, innovative entrants into our defense industrial base.</p><p>While the traditional primes are often villainized for their role in the stagnation of our defense acquisition, the truth is they are what the Pentagon has made them.</p><p>Decades of systemic inefficiencies have created the paradigm we see today. The FY 2026 NDAA takes important steps to address these problems.</p><p>First, the NDAA’s "commercial first" model champions speed and agility, requiring Pentagon acquisition officers to prioritize commercial options over costly, bespoke development programs. This can save us years in development and billions in taxpayer dollars.</p><p>Second, by narrowing requirements in contracting to only those required by law, the FY 2026 NDAA opens doors to a multitude of innovative businesses, big and small, who can participate in the defense industrial base. This will save costs and strengthen supply chains by ensuring we aren’t reliant on a pool of subcontractors so small that our most critical components for military equipment have only one, maybe two, suppliers.</p><p>Finally, by reforming how the Department of War values past performance, Congress is ending the tyranny of incumbency at the Pentagon. The War Department currently favors entrenched contractors over newer startups – even those that offer superior solutions. Making this change will level the playing field with a focus on competition and improvement instead of a "don’t rock the boat" mentality.</p><p>These reforms will ensure our defense industrial base is vibrant and able to produce and iterate quickly – a requirement for modern warfare. Take the war between Ukraine and Russia, for example. That conflict consumes thousands of drones, missiles and bombs per month. The U.S. struggles to make that many in a year.</p><p>Quantity has a quality all its own. We must ensure we are able to not just produce weapons and materials quickly, but re-fit, re-tool and redeploy them just as fast.</p><p>The United States simply cannot afford to wait until the next war starts to fix our broken acquisition system. We cannot sacrifice our national security on the altar of bureaucracy.</p><p>The time is now for Congress to reinvigorate our defense industrial base to meet the demands of the 21st century. Let’s get to work.</p><p><i>Katherine Boyle is a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz and co-lead of its American Dynamism practice.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump’s H-1B visa reform plan needs to put Americans first</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump’s executive order just put a $100,000 fee on new petitions for H-1B temporary workers. The rollout suffered from muddled communication, and the order does not stop the H-1B from being used to replace American workers — but it’s a sorely needed first step.</p><p>Created more than 30 years ago to fill a temporary labor shortage, the H-1B has ballooned beyond its intended scope. It needs to be reformed to put American workers first.</p><p>Explaining how the H-1B went so far off the rails would take a whole report — which is why I’ve written one, coming out soon. Meanwhile, here are some of the problems.  </p><p>H-1Bs allow companies to replace American workers with cheap foreign labor and suppress wages for Americans. Exceptions to the original H-1B annual cap of 65,000 visas each fiscal year have expanded the number far beyond statutory limits.</p><p>First, 20,000 more were set aside for applicants with a master's degree or higher degree. Then, H-1Bs for universities and government research organizations were made cap-exempt. Then DHS allowed the spouses of H-1B holders to work.</p><p>Fraud, nepotism and corruption have long compromised the H-1B process. Outsourcing firms and "body shops" rig the labor market to hire foreign workers over Americans.</p><p>Yet there is no shortage of domestic science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) graduates. Every year, the U.S. produces more graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer science and engineering than the economy demands, and overall, only 28% of workers with a STEM degree actually work in a STEM job.</p><p>There are some high-talent H-1Bs, but as Howard University Political Science Professor Ron Hira says, the typical H-1B recipients "are ordinary skilled workers" who could be supplied domestically.</p><p>Amazon, Intel, Google, Microsoft and many other companies have let American workers go while they continued to hire thousands of H-1Bs. Companies predictably deny any connection between the two phenomena, but laid-off U.S. workers insist otherwise. In 2020, the site White Collar Workers of America ranked the "Misfortune 500" body shops most-abusive of H-1Bs. In some cases, companies even require Americans they are sacking to train their foreign replacements.</p><p>On Sept. 25, Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and Illinois Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin wrote to the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and other large American companies asking for specific information about their hiring of H-1Bs, saying "we find it hard to believe that [you] cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions."</p><p>H-1Bs were supposed to be limited to three years, but holders can renew up to six years. And if an alien can’t get a green card because of the cap (no one country is allowed more than 7% of the annual visas), he can get three-year extensions indefinitely.</p><p>Many of the top employers of H-1B workers are foreign-based outsourcers who hire thousands of low-wage H-1Bs and farm them out to U.S. industry. More than 70% of new H-1B workers are from India, with China a distant second at 11%.</p><p>By going through an outsourcing firm, U.S. companies can pay less and avoid negative publicity when replacing Americans. In 2024, hundreds of subcontractors filed for H-1Bs on behalf of Verizon, Wells Fargo, and Walmart. From 2020 to 2024, Citigroup hired more than 3,000 new H-1B workers via outsourcers, who paid them less than those Citi hired directly.</p><p>Many H-1B subcontractors commit unscrupulous or illegal practices. In 2024, Kishore Dattapuram and Kumar Aswapathi, owners of Nanosemantics in San Jose, California, pled guilty in an H-1B visa case. According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, "In pleading guilty, Dattapuram admitted to working with Aswapathi and Giri to submit fraudulent H-1B applications that falsely represented that foreign workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated end-client companies when, in fact, the jobs did not exist."</p><p>Outsourcing giant Cognizant has successfully petitioned for over 52,000 new H-1B workers since 2009, the highest of any company. In 2024, Cognizant was found liable for intentionally discriminating against more than 2,000 non-Indian employees between 2013 and 2022.</p><p>American workers at Cognizant were twice as likely to be fired or resign than workers on visas, and, "Black employees were let go at a rate 23 times that of Asian workers." According to Bloomberg, "each of the five largest outsourcing companies has either settled, lost or is currently fighting a discrimination lawsuit" within the last four years." Yet they are allowed to continue petitioning for new workers.</p><p>The H-1B salary minimum was set at $60,000 in the 1990s but has not been adjusted for inflation. Employers must attest that they will pay new H-1Bs at least the prevailing wage, but a July 2025 Heritage Foundation report showed most H-1B positions pay below-average salaries.</p><p>Microsoft reportedly pays 82% of its foreign workers less than the market wage. Accounting giant Deloitte paid H-1B workers 10% less than Americans in similar roles. Many universities use their cap-exempt status to recruit foreign workers over their own graduates.</p><p>The most corrupt element in the H-1B pipeline is when they convert to permanent residence. This "PERM process," according to a 2020 Department of Labor report, "relentlessly has employers not complying with the qualifying criteria" — because it is a hoop which they must reluctantly jump through before they can hire their preferred, foreign candidate into a job. </p><p>The law requires PERM jobs to be advertised, but companies try to hide them. They try to minimally advertise open positions while avoiding qualified American applicants.</p><p>In 2021, Facebook (Meta) was fined $4.75 million for intentionally denying qualified U.S. workers a fair opportunity to apply for jobs that it had reserved for H-1Bs. In 2023, Apple paid $25 million for similar discrimination. But these fines are minuscule compared with the profits from bringing in cheap labor.</p><p>In 2025, a group of veteran tech workers set up the site www.jobs.now. They find deliberately obscure job advertisements and post them, advising applicants to file complaints with the Department of Justice if they believe they were unfairly rejected.</p><p>At a time when 6.1% of recent college graduates with computer science majors are unemployed, allowing thousands of foreign workers to compete against them on unfair terms makes no sense.</p><p>Charging new H-1B petitioners $100,000 will be a body blow to body shops. But it will leave open many other side doors to unfair competition. Let’s hope this is the beginning of more reform to put the H-1B back in its box and give Americans first crack at their own labor market.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">‘Love You Forever’ author may soon die by assisted suicide, pro-life groups call decision ‘heartbreaking’</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The author of the beloved and iconic children’s book "Love You Forever" is reportedly considering ending his life through physician-assisted suicide, and pro-life groups are grieving the decision. </p><p>"It is heartbreaking that children’s author Robert Munsch wants to pursue assisted suicide," Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, told Fox News Digital in a statement. </p><p>"His children’s book ‘Love You Forever’ illustrates the kind of care and unconditional love that should be extended to a person in their last days," Tobias added. </p><p>Robert Munsch, 80, has written 85 published books including "Love You Forever," "The Paper Bag Princess," and "Mud Puddle." </p><p>In "Love You Forever," Munsch tells the story of a mother’s unconditional love for her son as he grows. In the final scene, the grown son cradles his aging mother in a rocking chair.</p><p>"The son went to his mother," "Love You Forever" reads. "He picked her up and rocked her back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And he sang this song, ‘I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I’m living, my Mommy you’ll be.’" </p><p>Munsch, who has been diagnosed with dementia and Parkinson’s, was reportedly approved for physician-assisted suicide in Canada. </p><p>He told the New York Times Magazine recently that he hasn’t yet chosen a date to die, but said he would pursue it "when I start having real trouble talking and communicating. Then I'll know."</p><p>Canada legalized physician assisted suicide in 2016, but in 2021 it was modified to include those with serious and chronic physical conditions, including those that are not non-life threatening. </p><p>"True compassion means walking with people through their pain, not abandoning them to a premature death," Tobias told Fox News Digital. "Every life has inherent value, no matter the circumstances, and our society should be investing in excellent palliative care and support systems—not in policies that treat vulnerable people as if their lives are disposable." </p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Munsch for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump’s cashless bail reform is a good first step. There are 5 more we need right now</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Cashless bail is a start. But to truly turn the tide on rising crime in America, President Donald Trump will have to focus on the entire criminal justice system, not just pretrial release. Five key stages must be addressed if he wants to Make America Safe Again: police, prosecutors, the judiciary, corrections and parole and probation.  This won’t be an easy task. But if he uses the same approach he’s taking on bail reform — tying compliance to federal funding — he can force change in jurisdictions that refuse to prioritize public safety. If this is done right, these reforms won’t just make headlines; they can make a lasting difference that protects Americans for generations.  On Aug. 25, 2025, Trump signed the executive order, "Taking Steps to End Cashless Bail to Protect Americans." I applaud him for directing the attorney general to identify states and localities that have eliminated cash bail for crimes that clearly threaten public safety. </p><p> Cashless bail allows defendants to be arrested, appear before a judge and walk free without putting up a dime. There’s no monetary consequence for skipping court. This has fueled a revolving-door justice system in which repeat offenders are back on the streets before the police have even finished their paperwork. Ending this reckless policy is a critical first step — but it’s only the beginning. </p><p>Without well-trained, properly equipped police, arrests don’t stick. Good policing is more than putting handcuffs on a suspect; it’s building a case that can survive in court. As a former prosecutor, I know that meeting the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard is tough enough. But when officers cut corners on evidence collection or fail to secure witnesses, prosecutors are left with cases they can’t win. That means dangerous criminals go free. Training, accountability and resources for police departments are essential if we want convictions, not dismissals. </p><p> Even with strong police work, justice fails when rogue prosecutors refuse to enforce the law. We’ve seen this in cities like Los Angeles under District Attorney George Gascón, where the priority seemed to be freeing offenders rather than protecting the public. Contrast that with Nathan Hochman, who, upon becoming L.A.’s district attorney in 2024, declared: "District attorneys must have only two things as their North Stars: the facts and the law." That’s the kind of prosecutorial mentality Americans deserve: prosecutors who put victims and communities first, not their own ideology. </p><p> Trial judges wield enormous power in determining justice. Yet in many states, appointments and elections have filled benches with judges who care more about politics than public safety. The solution? Mandatory minimums. Legislatures are already realizing that unchecked judicial leniency has swung the pendulum too far. By setting clear sentencing floors for serious crimes, lawmakers can prevent judges from turning criminals loose and ensure real consequences for dangerous behavior. </p><p>Corrections isn’t just about warehousing inmates. It’s about ensuring that prisons, jails and correctional systems don’t become revolving doors. Too often, early-release programs put violent offenders back on the streets long before their time is up. Strong oversight and real consequences inside the corrections system are critical to protecting the public. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A retired U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent was among two victims killed in the deadly shooting at the Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino on Sunday, Eagle Pass Aaron Valdez confirmed on social media. </p><p>Mayor Valdez described Marcus "Mark" Antley as a beloved member of the community and said he was remembered for his law enforcement career and impact on Eagle Pass.</p><p>"Mr. Antley dedicated much of his life to public service and law enforcement. He will be remembered not only for his career but also for his generosity, leadership, and the lasting friendships he built throughout Eagle Pass and the region. His passing leaves a deep void in the hearts of many," Valdez wrote on Facebook.</p><p>Valdez also pledged to support the grieving families of those who were injured in the attack and thanked law enforcement for their quick work capturing a suspect.</p><p>Dimmit County Judge Martha Alicia Gomez Ponce said the other victim in Sunday's shooting was a Dimmit County resident. </p><p>"Let us come together in unity and support for the victims and their loved ones within our Dimmit County community," Ponce wrote on Facebook.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers battled each other in an absolute slugfest on Sunday night, and it ended in a 40-40 tie.</p><p>The stakes were already heightened coming into AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, as Micah Parsons was making his return to play his former team. While his impact was felt, it was the offenses that really came to play.</p><p>The last two minutes of regulation underscored that.</p><p>The Cowboys needed to respond to a Packers touchdown. KaVontae Turpin returned a kickoff to near midfield. It only took four plays for Dak Prescott and the Cowboys to find the end zone. Following a 19-yard pass to Jalen Tolbert, he found George Pickens for a 28-yard touchdown.</p><p>Dallas drove 54 yards in 62 seconds to get the go-ahead score.</p><p>Green Bay was quick to get back up the field. Packers quarterback Jordan Love led the team down the field in seven plays to set up a game-tying 53-yard field goal for Brandon McManus.</p><p>In overtime, the Cowboys got the ball first. Prescott found Tolbert coming back to the ball to make an incredible catch on the sideline. Somehow, Tolbert got both of his feet in bounds to set Dallas up in the red zone. The Cowboys couldn’t get into the end zone. Parsons possibly saved a touchdown with a sack of a scrambling Prescott. It was Brandon Aubrey who hit the chip shot to go up 40-37.</p><p>It was Love’s turn to lead the charge. On third down, the Cowboys may have gotten away with a defensive pass interference call. But it didn’t deter Love. The quarterback found Matthew Golden to keep the drive alive.</p><p>The Packers nearly ran out of time to make a final throw to the end zone. But he was left with one second on the clock. McManus came onto the field to kick the game-tying field goal.</p><p>Love was 31-of-43 with 337 passing yards and three touchdown passes. Each of his touchdown passes went to Romeo Doubs. The wide receiver had six catches for 58 yards.</p><p>Josh Jacobs was a menace on the ground. He had two rushing touchdowns to go along with 86 yards on the ground. He had four catches for 71 yards as well.</p><p>The Cowboys showed that they weren’t going to roll over and let the Packers walk all over them in their house. </p><p>First, Dallas picked up a crucial two points when they blocked a Packers extra-point attempt in the second quarter. Markquese Bell returned the ball for the two points.</p><p>Then, the Cowboys took advantage as the Green Bay offense appeared to get complacent toward the end of the first half. Cowboys linebacker James Houston caused Love to fumble. He recovered it and gave Dallas a chance to score before halftime. Prescott then found Pickens in the end zone. Dallas had a 16-13 lead at halftime.</p><p>Pickens had an incredible game for the Cowboys. He had eight catches on 11 targets for 134 yards and two touchdowns.</p><p>Prescott was 31-of-40 for 319 yards and three touchdowns. He was only sacked once.</p><p>Green Bay moved to 2-1-1 with the tie and Dallas became 1-2-1.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">What will be Tyler Robinson’s defense strategy? Experts weigh in on accused Charlie Kirk assassin</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Tyler Robinson's new defense attorney has an uphill battle representing the accused assassin of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, experts say.</p><p>"The goal for his new high-profile defense attorneys in the Tyler Robinson case is going to be keep him off of death row," said Maryland attorney and legal analyst Randolph Rice, who is following the case. "And that's probably their goal right now, or at least that's what they're thinking about."</p><p>One option would be to seek a plea deal that spares Robinson from the potential death penalty, like Bryan Kohberger's defense in the Idaho student murders. That could be months or even years down the line.</p><p>If the case does go to trial, prosecutors will have to prove that Kirk's murder included aggravating factors that warrant execution if the suspect is found guilty.</p><p>"What the defense may be able to argue is to say, this was a single sniper bullet that had a single intended target — and therefore it posed no other danger to anyone else," Rice told Fox News Digital. "And if they can prove that to a jury or they can convince a jury of that, then they won't get the aggravating murder, and therefore they won't have the death penalty on the table."</p><p>Robinson, like all criminal defendants in the U.S., is considered innocent until proven guilty. But prosecutors are expected to unveil a mountain of evidence in court, and the politically charged case is being closely watched around the country.</p><p>Kirk, an outspoken conservative whose organization sought to promote right-of-center thinking on traditionally liberal campuses, was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10. Robinson allegedly told his roommate and romantic partner that he did it because he "had enough of [Kirk's] hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out."</p><p>The partner, who was identified as trans, is cooperating with investigators.</p><p>"Obviously they've got the concern about defending their client, they've got concerns about the media attention, but I also think that they may have concerns about their personal safety," Rice said. "This certainly is a political assassination. It's something that has been in the headlines. There are a lot of individuals who are emotional about this. And certainly people on the left are certainly emotional about it. People on the right are certainly emotional about it. And so there are concerns from the defense team's perspective. About their personal safety and that's something they're going to have to consider throughout this entire trial."</p><p>Authorities say they've recovered messages to his romantic partner and other friends taking responsibility for the shooting. According to a probable cause affidavit, he had "confessed...or implied" guilt to a close family friend. The Washington County Sheriff's Office later said his parents convinced him to surrender peacefully rather than take his own life.</p><p>Police recovered a rifle at the scene that investigators allege had Robinson's DNA on it. They also have surveillance video on the campus and nearby roads and a footprint on the rooftop where a sniper fired the bullet that killed Kirk.</p><p>According to court documents, the suspect used his phone on school grounds at least once, on video. That could provide police with additional evidence. They also identified a suspect vehicle, a gray Dodge Challenger, like the one Robinson drives.</p><p>And as Fox News Digital reported Thursday, an officer guarding the campus perimeter "made contact" with Robinson near where police recovered the suspected murder weapon as he was allegedly texting his roommate about wanting to retrieve it before skipping town, according to law enforcement sources.</p><p>Defending a death penalty case will require Robinson's legal team to hire forensic specialists, mental health evaluators and jury consultants, among other measures, Rice said, but his lawyers may have to fight for funding or risk being "hamstrung" before the case goes to trial.</p><p>Kirk's family may also weigh in before prosecutors decide to offer a plea deal. His widow, Erika Kirk, said during her husband's memorial service Sunday said she has already forgiven Robinson "because it was what Christ did, and it's what Charlie would do."</p><p>Separately, she said she did not want to get involved in the decision to seek capital punishment in an interview with the New York Times.</p><p>"I’ll be honest," she told the paper. "I told our lawyer, I want the government to decide this. I do not want that man’s blood on my ledger. Because when I get to heaven, and Jesus is like: ‘Uh, eye for an eye? Is that how we do it?’ And that keeps me from being in heaven, from being with Charlie?"</p><p>If prosecutors decide to offer a plea deal, it may not look like the recent plea for Bryan Kohberger in the Idaho student murders case, according to Louis Gelormino, a Staten Island defense attorney who is following the case.</p><p>"One of the things that surprised me out there in Kohberger was they didn’t let him allocute to the crimes," he told Fox News Digital. "Usually, when you take a plea, you have to confess to your crimes. I would imagine here, if they do take that off the table and they do get a plea out of him, that he’ll have to allocute and explain his crime in public."</p><p>He said he expects Robinson's team to explore a potential insanity defense, but his alleged escape from Orem and week spent plotting the crime could complicate that argument. He also expects defense attorneys to challenge as much evidence as possible in case prosecutors or police failed to "cross all their Ts and dot all their Is," he said.</p><p>"It’s an incredibly tough case," he added. "I don’t envy the defense attorney at all...They’ve got all the evidence in the world."</p><p>Robinson is accused of shooting Kirk in the neck with a hunting rifle from a rooftop at Utah Valley University while the victim was speaking to students and other attendees at a Turning Point USA-sponsored event.</p><p>Robinson's lead defense counsel, veteran lawyer Kathy Nester, was formally appointed to the case Wednesday.</p><p>In Nester's 30 years of experience, she's defended capital cases in California and Utah, and recent high-profile clients include Kouri Richins, a Utah mother of three accused of killing her husband and then writing a children's book about dealing with grief.</p><p>She did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray's office announced the prosecution's trial team would include six attorneys on Monday.</p><p>They include Gray, who spent 23 years with the state attorney general's office and has appeared before both the U.S. and Utah Supreme Courts; Chad Grunander, who prosecuted Utah's first-ever televised trial and has put cold case and cop killers behind bars; Christopher Ballard, who has argued more than 175 appellate cases; Ryan McBride, last year's Utah Prosecutor of the Year; David Sturgill, a veteran prosecutor who is an adjunct professor at UVU, and Lauren Hunt, whose role in the case against double murder suspect Christopher Poulson garnered recognition from the FBI.</p><p>Robinson is due back in court on Monday for a waiver hearing, which will determine whether the defense forces prosecutors to present probable cause before the case proceeds.</p><p>Declining to waive is a defensive strategy that would give his attorneys access to additional discovery materials and a chance to cross-examine state witnesses early on, Rice said.</p><p>Prosecutors have charged Robinson with seven counts, including aggravated murder, which carries the potential death penalty, felony firearms charges, obstruction of justice, witness tampering and committing violence in the presence of a child.</p><p>He has not yet entered a plea.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Harris claims Kimmel suspension happened because Trump 'couldn't take a joke'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris claimed Jimmy Kimmel was briefly suspended because President Donald Trump "couldn’t take a joke" during a speech Saturday night.</p><p>Harris gave the keynote address at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Phoenix Awards Gala, where the current president was a predominant topic. Although Harris did not mention Trump by name, she repeatedly referenced "the president" and suggested it was his "fragile ego" that was behind the ABC late-night host’s temporary suspension.</p><p>"When a president with a fragile ego couldn’t take the joke and brought down the weight of the federal government to silence the voice of a citizen, folks spoke with their pocketbooks this week, and Jimmy Kimmel is now back on the air," Harris said.</p><p>Kimmel came under fire two weeks ago after he suggested on his show that right-wing critics were hitting "new lows" trying to frame Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin as someone other than a member of the "MAGA gang," despite authorities already confirming the suspect’s leftist ideology.</p><p>"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it," Kimmel said.</p><p>As a result, broadcasting companies Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group preempted the show from its ABC affiliates over what they believed were "ill-timed" and "insensitive" comments. Disney suspended the show shortly afterward, only to bring the show back the following Tuesday.</p><p>Several media commentators and Democratic politicians have similarly blamed Trump for Kimmel’s suspension after Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr issued a veiled threat against the show for his original comments.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment.</p><p>During her speech, Harris also emphasized the importance of winning the 2026 midterm elections to push back on an "unchecked, incompetent, unhinged president."</p><p>"You are the leaders who are up for the fight. You are leaders who have courage," Harris said to the crowd. "You are leaders who speak truth, leaders who know that at a time such as this, it demands one thing for sure: we must fight fire with fire."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New York Times correspondent and 1619 Project author Nikole Hannah-Jones called efforts by public figures to mourn and venerate Charlie Kirk after his assassination "unsettling" in an essay Sunday.</p><p>After Kirk was assassinated during a Turning Point USA event on a Utah campus earlier this month, Hannah-Jones accused some Democrats and political centrists of "lining up" to honor someone with "extremist" views. </p><p>"[I]n the wake of Kirk’s death, individuals and institutions across the nation moved not just to condemn his killing and political violence, but to venerate him. It was unsettling to many to see politicians from across the political spectrum speak with reverence about a man who espoused the racist Great Replacement Theory, which argues that white Americans are being systematically replaced by multiculturalism and by brown and Black immigrants," Hannah-Jones wrote.</p><p>She added that Kirk "contended that Black people commit more crime than white people" and that Islam "is not compatible with Western civilization."</p><p>Hannah-Jones also rejected efforts to celebrate Kirk as a champion of free speech, claiming that they would lead to "the mainstreaming of formerly extremist views."</p><p>"As the Trump administration wages the broadest attack on civil rights in a century, and the shared societal values of multiculturalism and tolerance recede, using Kirk’s knack for vigorous argument to excuse the re-emergence of unabashed bigotry in mainstream politics feels both frightening and perilous," Hannah-Jones wrote.</p><p>She argued that praising Kirk’s willingness to peacefully debate and hold discourse with political opponents overlooks the people of the Black and transgender community "directly targeted" by the activist’s rhetoric.</p><p>"At a time when the president of the United States is using his power to go after diversity efforts and engaging in a mass deportation project, some progressives are arguing that people of color, immigrants and members of other marginalized groups who felt dehumanized by Kirk’s commentary, podcasts and debates have to find a way to locate common ground with his followers," Hannah-Jones wrote.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Turning Point USA for comment.</p><p>Several Democratic politicians and media commentators have similarly critiqued Kirk’s rhetoric after his death. Fifty-eight House Democrats voted against a resolution to honor Kirk with Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., saying his legacy belongs "in the dustbin of history."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Score another victory for President Donald Trump in the high-stakes political battle between Republicans and Democrats over congressional redistricting.</p><p>GOP Gov. Mike Kehoe of Missouri on Sunday signed into law a new congressional map, Missouri First, that is likely to hand Republicans an additional seat in the U.S. House of Representatives ahead of next year's midterms elections.</p><p>Missouri, once considered a swing state that has dramatically shifted to the right over the past decade and a half, is the latest battleground in the congressional redistricting showdown after the passage of new maps in GOP-dominated Texas and a redistricting push by Democrats in heavily blue California. </p><p>"I was proud to officially sign the Missouri First Map into law today ahead of the 2026 midterm election," Kehoe said in a statement. "We believe this map best represents Missourians, and I appreciate the support and efforts of state legislators, our congressional delegation, and President Trump in getting this map to my desk."</p><p>Trump, in a social media statement following passage in the GOP-dominated state legislature, called the new map "FANTASTIC" and said it "will help send an additional MAGA Republican to Congress in the 2026 Midterm Elections."</p><p>The new map targets longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver's Kansas City-area district by shifting it eastward to include rural right-leaning voters. The new map would likely flip Cleaver's seat and give Republicans a 7-1 advantage in the state's House delegation.</p><p>Cleaver has vowed to take legal action if the new map is signed into law by the governor.</p><p>"I want to warn all of us that if you fight fire with fire long enough, all you’re going to have left is ashes," Cleaver said earlier this month as he testified in front of a Missouri Senate committee.</p><p>And pointing to recent public opinion polling, he called the redistricting plan "immensely unpopular."</p><p>And Missouri House Minority Leader Ashley Aune accused Republicans of pushing to "rig our maps and eliminate our representation in Congress."</p><p>Kehoe's announcement teeing up the special session came hours after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed into law a redistricting bill passed by the Republican supermajority in the state legislature that aims to create up to five right-leaning congressional districts at the expense of current Democrat-controlled seats in the reliably red state.</p><p>The efforts in Missouri and Texas are part of a broad effort by the GOP to pad its razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.</p><p>Trump and his political team are aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House, when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.</p><p>Democrats are fighting back against the rare, but not unheard-of mid-decade redistricting.</p><p>State lawmakers in heavily blue California have approved a special ballot proposition this November to obtain voter approval to temporarily sidetrack the state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature.</p><p>The effort in California, which aims to create five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts and counter the shift in Texas, is being spearheaded by two-term Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is seen as a likely 2028 Democratic presidential contender.</p><p>With Democrats currently needing just a three-seat pickup in next year's midterms to win back the House majority, Republicans in Indiana, South Carolina, Florida, Kansas and Nebraska are mulling their own GOP-friendly redistricting plans ahead of the 2026 elections. And right-leaning Ohio is under a court order to draw new maps ahead of the midterms.</p><p>Democrats, as they push back, are looking to New York, Illinois and Maryland in the hopes of creating more left-leaning congressional seats.</p><p>In Illinois and Maryland, where governors J.B. Pritzker and Wes Moore are discussing redistricting, Democrats hope to pick up to three more left-leaning seats.</p><p>And Democrats could pick up a seat in Republican-dominated Utah, where a judge recently ordered the GOP-controlled legislature to draw new maps after ruling that lawmakers four years ago ignored an independent commission approved by voters to prevent partisan gerrymandering. </p><p> </p><p> </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The state of Oregon filed a lawsuit Sunday to block President Donald Trump’s plan to deploy 200 National Guard troops to Portland.</p><p>The suit was announced by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield within hours of Gov. Tina Kotek receiving a memo from Department of War Secretary Pete Hegseth, in which he authorized the troop deployment for 60 days.</p><p>According to the order seen by Fox News Digital, the federally controlled Oregon National Guard would be stationed in Portland to protect federal property "where protests are occurring or likely to occur."</p><p>Kotek, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, and Rayfield, all Democrats, responded by jointly filing the challenge in federal court, arguing the administration’s move is "unlawful" and unnecessary.</p><p>"Oregon communities are stable, and our local officials have been clear: we have the capacity to manage public safety without federal interference," Rayfield said in a statement. </p><p>On Saturday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he had directed Hegseth to send "all necessary Troops to protect war-ravaged Portland, and any other ICE facilities under siege from attack by Antifa and other domestic terrorists."</p><p>Kotek also said Saturday she had spoken directly with the president before Sunday’s order and had urged him not to send in troops. </p><p>"Our city is a far cry from the war-ravaged community he has posted on social media," Kotek told reporters at a news conference at Tom McCall Waterfront Park.</p><p>"There is no insurrection, there is no threat to national security and there is no need for military troops in our major city," she added.</p><p>Despite those objections, federal agents began arriving in Portland over the weekend, with one clash already reported outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. </p><p>Mayor Wilson condemned the arrival of National Guard troops.</p><p>"We did not ask for them to come. They are here without precedent or purpose," he said.</p><p>Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., urged demonstrators to avoid confrontations with federal agents.

We have no comment on this nor the Oregon ARNG deployment at this time," a Department of War spokesperson told Fox News Digital.</p><p><i>Fox News' Jacqui Heinrich contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

His playful, over-the-top creations draw inspiration from Ramsay’s humor as well as his high standards in the kitchen.</p><p>The partnership, born out of a tongue-in-cheek moment, has now translated into culinary success. Han has turned the "idiot sandwich" meme into a launchpad for his own cookbook, "Stacked," and national TV appearances. </p><p>"So today we are making a breakfast club sandwich from [Idiot Sandwich]," Han began during his "Fox &amp; Friends" segment.</p><p>"Traditionally, club sandwiches [are] not typically something you eat for breakfast," he explained. "But when you have it on a croissant and add chili eggs, then it’s definitely good."</p><p>He layered in basil mayo, roasted turkey, but said you can always use deli meat "if you’re an idiot and don’t want to get your own roaster."</p><p>The creator then added crispy prosciutto, tomato with chili flake, a fried egg, and fresh arugula. When Brian Kilmeade complained about the size, joking that sandwiches this large often require a fork, Han offered some playful advice.</p><p>"Just go for it," he laughed. "Squish it down."</p><p>The rising chef credits his background for his style. </p><p>"My mom’s Italian, my dad’s Chinese," he said. "To me, just two great food cultures. Born in Italy and just really blessed with great food all around growing up traveling."</p><p>That mix helped him win the Vegas contest, through a signature sandwich.</p><p>"I call it a not-so-classic cheesesteak," Han said. "I do Beijing beef from the Chinese side and then, for the Italian side, I had malted mozzarella and a little hot Italian peppers as well."</p><p>Back on set, he presented the "Breakfast Club." </p><p>"Look at that cross-section right there," Han said, showing off his creation. </p><p>The Idiot Sandwich cookbook is set to come out Sept. 30.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Rory McIlroy was public enemy No. 1 at Bethpage Black all week.</p><p>The reigning Masters champion was the solo leader in heckles thrown his way at this weekend's Ryder Cup on Long Island. Most were fine, but many crossed the line.</p><p>Whether it was telling him his wife was "a four," asking about Amanda Balionis amid a previously rumored fling (with his wife mere feet away), dropping F-bombs, or constant reminders of the 2024 U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2, McIlroy is sure to be happy that this Ryder Cup is over.</p><p></p><p>McIlroy was stoic and ignored everyone 99.9% of the time. But that 0.01% included him telling fans to "shut the f--- up" on Saturday morning and another instance that afternoon where a fan told him he was "not that good," to which he responded, "I'm very f---ing good."</p><p>"I am. I am really good," McIlroy reiterated to Fox News Digital during Europe's celebration press conference, right after chugging a beer.</p><p>But McIlroy has to stay composed, because an athlete is automatically the bad guy if they respond.</p><p>However, there are times — whether it’s playful banter or someone crossing a line — when McIlroy has no choice.</p><p>"Honestly, I'd say it's just on impulse," McIlroy said. "Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. I'm quite an impulsive character, if you haven't noticed. </p><p>"Sometimes I'll engage and sometimes I'll catch myself and refrain. But I don't really choose when, and it's just sort of sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.</p><p>At the end of the day, McIlroy got the last laugh, as his European squad made good on his bold prediction from two years ago, defeating the Americans 15-13 and becoming the first team to win a road Ryder Cup since 2012.</p><p>But the New York crowd is certainly unlike most, especially in a Ryder Cup.</p><p>Future Ryder Cup venues are set through 2039, which will be played at Hazeltine, where McIlroy had one of the fiercest matchups ever against Patrick Reed. So, the earliest a Ryder Cup can return to the New York metro area is 2043. </p><p>After all he endured, would McIlroy be OK with that?</p><p>"If the result is the same," McIlroy said slyly, "Absolutely."</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Michael Cohen stunned a MSNBC panel on Saturday after stating that he believed former FBI Director James Comey "likely committed a crime" while reacting to news of the indictment. </p><p>Cohen, who was Trump's personal lawyer for many years, surprised MSNBC panelists Elise Jordan, Ayman Mohyeldin and Molly Jong-Fast by saying, "I believe likely he will be found guilty."</p><p>"Well, that’s interesting," Jordan said as Cohen added, "I believe likely he committed a crime." </p><p>"Wait, what?" Jong-Fast added. </p><p>"I don’t know what that crime is, but there are hundreds of thousands of documents, and the government has each and every one of them, all they need to find is that one," Cohen said. "I’ve been through this system. I know better than anybody what a weaponized DOJ looks like and feels like. It is insurmountable."</p><p>Jordan pressed Cohen on whether he actually broke "the law," as he explained he pleaded guilty in his case. </p><p>Cohen was charged and then pleaded guilty in 2018 to crimes including tax evasion, campaign finance violations, and lying to Congress. Cohen later cooperated with investigations into Trump, publicly testifying against him during Alvin Bragg's hush money trial and becoming a vocal critic.</p><p>Mohyeldin asked Cohen to clarify whether he thought the Department of Justice had been weaponized under Trump. </p><p>Cohen argued the DOJ had been weaponized by the government for as long as it's been around.</p><p>"I think your argument is it was weaponized then, by Comey against Donald Trump. That’s what you’re arguing right now," Jordan said, attempting to clarify Cohen's argument. "And so you think that there will be evidence that will show that in court, and so thus validate Donald Trump’s vendetta against James Comey." </p><p>Cohen agreed and said, "I couldn't have said it better myself."</p><p>Comey was indicted by a grand jury on two counts: alleged false statements within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch and obstruction of congressional proceeding. </p><p>Comey will reportedly turn himself in on Friday and his arraignment is set for 10 a.m. on Oct. 9, in Alexandria Courtroom 600 before District Juge Michael S. Nachmanoff. </p><p>Fox News Digital exclusively reported in July that Comey was under criminal investigation by the FBI. The probe into Comey centered on whether he lied to Congress during his Sept. 30, 2020, testimony about his handling of the original Trump–Russia probe at the FBI, known inside the bureau as "Crossfire Hurricane."</p><p><i>Fox News' Brooke Singman and Greg Wehner contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">AI drives interest in blue-collar jobs among Gen Z: "I don't feel threatened"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.</p><p>Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. "I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent," he told CBS News.</p><p>Experts say the skilled trades — jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing — are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs. </p><p>More recently, signs that <span class="link">artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up</span> the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 42% of Gen Zers are today working in or pursuing a blue-collar or skilled trade job, according to a recent survey of 1,434 people by job-search firm ResumeBuilder.com. </p>
<p>"That route is losing some of the stigma," said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. "The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'"</p>
<h2>Harder path for college grads</h2><p>For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong — it's just behind the times. </p><p> "The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable," said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.</p><p>But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops $38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative. </p><p>Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found. </p>
<p>More recently, economists also point to a <span class="link">jump in unemployment</span> for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019. </p><p>Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. </p><h2>"AI can't go out in the field"</h2><p>Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services — solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business. </p><p>While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.</p><p>"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is," Curcie told CBS News. </p><p>Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.</p><p>Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.</p>
<p>"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench," he said.</p><p>Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase — no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security. </p><p>"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens," Palmer said. </p>
<p>Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company. </p><p>"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over," he said. "AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine."</p>

<div class="article-title">Where jobs are scarce, people could dodge Trump's Medicaid work rules</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Millions of Medicaid enrollees may have a way out of the new federal <span class="link">work requirement</span> — if they live in a county with high unemployment.</p><p>By January 2027, President Trump's far-reaching domestic policy law will require many adult, nondisabled Medicaid enrollees in 42 states and Washington, D.C., to work or volunteer 80 hours a month or go to school.</p><p>But under the law, Medicaid enrollees in counties where unemployment is at least 8% or 1.5 times the national unemployment rate could be shielded from the work requirement, if their state applies for an exemption.</p><p>A new analysis by KFF shows that exemption in the GOP's work requirement could offer a reprieve to potentially millions of Americans caught in a tough spot — needing to work to secure health insurance but having trouble finding a job.</p><p>The Congressional Budget Office projected the work requirement would apply to 18.5 million Medicaid enrollees, causing about 5.3 million to lose their government health coverage by 2034. CBO spokesperson Caitlin Emma confirmed to KFF Health News that analysts factored the unemployment rate exemption into their projections. Only states that expanded Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act or a special waiver must enact a work requirement, under the federal law.</p>
<p>But how many people could be exempt depends on how the Trump administration interprets the law, in addition to whether their states' officials apply.</p><p>For example, if Trump officials exempt people in counties where the unemployment rate has been above the law's thresholds for any month over a 12-month period, about 4.6 million Medicaid enrollees in 386 counties could qualify for an exemption today based on the latest unemployment data, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.</p><p>That amounts to just under a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees subject to the work requirement.</p><p>Under that one-month threshold, "the impact could be fairly significant," said Jennifer Tolbert, a co-author of the analysis and the deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.</p>
<p>But, she said, the Trump administration is more likely to adopt a stricter threshold based on average unemployment over a 12-month period. That would align with work requirements under the federal <span class="link">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</span>, the food assistance commonly known as food stamps.</p><p>Only about 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees living in 158 counties could be exempted under that standard, or about 7% of the total subject to work requirements, KFF found. That's about 7% of enrollees who live in expansion states who would otherwise need to meet the new requirement.</p><p>Based on the 12-month criteria, about 90% of Medicaid enrollees who could be exempted based on high unemployment reside in five states, according to KFF: California, New York, Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio. California alone accounts for over half of those who could be exempted.</p><p>The unemployment rate exemption is one of several carve-outs from the <span class="link">Medicaid work requirement</span> in the GOP's law. The law also exempts parents with children under 14, people who are disabled or frail, and those who are pregnant, incarcerated, or in a substance use disorder program, among others. The high unemployment provision is different than most because it exempts people living in entire counties.</p><p>Two top Republicans key to the bill's passage — House Speaker Mike Johnson and Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee — did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>To qualify for the Medicaid exemption, states would have to apply to the federal government on behalf of individuals in eligible counties. And if a county earned an exemption, the government would determine how long it applies.</p><p>Even if the federal government grants exemptions broadly, health advocates fear some Republican-led states could balk at applying for exemptions in order to keep enrollment down, as they say has been the case with SNAP exemptions. As of 2023, 18 states did not have an exemption under the SNAP program, even though some of their residents might be eligible.</p>
<p>"It's not a guarantee that people can rely on," said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group that intends to push for the broadest possible exemptions to help people maintain their coverage. Eastern Kentucky has several counties with perennially high unemployment.</p><p>In advocating for <span class="link">Mr. Trump's bill</span>, many Republicans in Washington argued that most people who gained Medicaid benefits under the Affordable Care Act should be working to get off of government assistance.</p><p>But as Georgia's and Arkansas' experiences have shown, Medicaid work requirements can be costly for states to run and frustrating for enrollees to navigate. About 18,000 people in Arkansas, or nearly a quarter of the state's adults who gained Medicaid coverage through the ACA expansion, lost coverage when the state had a work requirement in 2018 and 2019. A court ended the state's work requirement program.</p><p>Critics point out that most Medicaid enrollees already work or have a disability or caregiving responsibilities, and they argue the reporting requirements merely serve as a bureaucratic hurdle to obtaining and keeping coverage. Under the GOP law, enrollees' work status needs to be verified at least twice a year.</p><p>Most of the coverage losses due to work requirements occur among people who work or should qualify for an exemption but nevertheless lose coverage due to red tape, research shows.</p><p>Not every state must implement a work requirement under Mr. Trump's law, only those that chose to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income people through the ACA or a federal waiver. The ACA has provided hundreds of billions in federal dollars to help states cover everyone making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — $21,597 for an individual in 2025.</p><p>Forty states and Washington, D.C., took up the expansion. Georgia and Wisconsin partly expanded their Medicaid eligibility by getting a federal waiver, adding them to the list of states subject to the work requirement. These two states were not included in the KFF analysis because of a lack of county-level enrollment data.</p>
<p>Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said she is pleased the law makes some exceptions for places where jobs are scarce. It could limit how many people lose coverage because of the work requirement, she said.</p><p>Wagner said SNAP's unemployment rate exemption has helped millions of people avoid losing their food assistance, but its impact also depends on whether a state seeks the waiver.</p><p>She is concerned the Trump administration may make it difficult for counties to get exempted under the Medicaid law.</p><p>"I'm glad it's in there as it will certainly help people, but it's still a terrible bill," she said. "This will not really blunt the harm of the bill."</p><p><em>KFF Health News</em><em> is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at </em><em>KFF</em><em> — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">State Fair corn dogs on stick, Jimmy Dean sausage on stick products recalled</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><article class="content content-article lazyload" data-index="0" data-path="/news/corn-dogs-sausage-on-a-stick-recall-wood-pieces-in-batter/" id="article-0">
<section class="content__body">
<p>About 58 million pounds of corn dogs and other sausage-on-a-stick products are being recalled across the U.S. because pieces of wood may be embedded in the batter, with several consumers reporting injuries to date. </p><p>According to a Saturday notice published by the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, the recall covers select "State Fair Corn Dogs on a Stick" and "Jimmy Dean Pancakes &amp; Sausage on a Stick" products from Texas-based Hillshire Brands, which is a subsidiary of Tyson Foods. </p><p>The contamination problem was discovered after Hillshire received multiple consumer complaints, the service notes, five of which involved injuries. The company later determined that a "limited number" of these products included "extraneous pieces of wooden stick within the batter," Tyson said in a corresponding announcement - adding that it opted to initiate a recall "out of an abundance of caution."</p>
<p>The recalled corn dogs and sausage-on-a-stick goods were produced between March 17 and as recently Friday, per Saturday's recall notices. Tyson, which is headquartered in Arkansas, says the issue was isolated to one facility located in Haltom City, Texas. </p><p>FSIS is worried that some of these recalled products may be in consumers' refrigerators and freezers in households across the U.S. - as well as some schools and other institutions. In addition to being sold online and to retailers nationwide, the agency noted Saturday, these products were also sold to school districts and Defense Department facilities.</p>
<p>Consumers in possession of the now recalled "State Fair Corn Dogs on a Stick" and "Jimmy Dean Pancakes &amp; Sausage on a Stick" are urged to throw them away or return them to their place of purchase.  </p>
<p>To determine which corn dogs and other sausage goods are subject to this recall, consumers should check the product's name, use by dates and other identifying information published online by the FSIS and Tyson. The products being recalled should also have an establishment number of "EST-582" or "P-894" printed on the packaging. </p><p>It's unclear if consumers who purchased these now-recalled products will be eligible for a refund. The FSIS says consumers with questions about the recall can contact Christina Self, The Hillshire Brands Company Associate Director of Customer Care, at 888-747-7611.     </p><p>Foreign object contamination is one of the top reasons for food recalls in the U.S. Beyond plastic, metal fragments, bits of bugs and more "extraneous" materials have prompted recalls by making their way into packaged goods.</p>

<div class="article-title">At least 3 dead in Arizona following devastating flooding</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>At least three people are confirmed dead after heavy rain caused flooding in Arizona, and hundreds of propane tanks have created a hazardous situation in a rural community devastated by the floods.</p><p>Two people died and at least one person was missing after rain inundated Globe, a city of about 7,250 people about 88 miles east of Phoenix, Mayor  Al Gameros told CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV. Officials initially said three people were dead, but that was updated on Sunday.</p><p>Another person was found dead Saturday morning near a vehicle caught in floodwaters in suburban Phoenix the night before. The vehicle appeared to be empty after it was spotted partially submerged in about 8 feet of fast-moving water on Friday evening in a greenbelt park area, the Scottsdale Fire Department said. After the water dropped a bit overnight, crews found the body of a person pinned underneath a walkway bridge, the department said.</p>
<p>In the rural community of Globe, one of Arizona's oldest mining towns, sheriff deputies were looking into reports of more people who may be missing, said Carl Melford, emergency manager in Gila County, but he couldn't specify a number.</p><p>"We now have a massive search and rescue underway," he said.</p><p>According to the National Weather Service in Phoenix, the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport on Friday saw the highest one-day rainfall total in nearly seven years. It was also the city's fourth wettest day in recorded history since 2000.</p>
<p>Rain poured down and quickly flooded the downtown area Friday, Melford said. One of the first areas hit was a propane tank distributor, sending about 1,000 residential-sized tanks throughout the community, he said.</p><p>"There's propane tanks everywhere through downtown Globe," he said, adding that hazmat workers have been sent to the scene. "Luckily none of them ignited or exploded."</p><p>The area previously experienced flooding in 2021 after a wildfire, but it didn't happen like this, Melford said.</p><p>"This was an extremely heavy amount of rain in an extremely short period of time," he said.</p>
<p>Authorities are asking residents to not go out searching in the floodwaters because search and rescue officials are accompanied by dogs who might pick up the scent of aspiring volunteers instead of possible flood victims. If people want to help, they should start by assisting friends and neighbors in need, Melford said.</p><p>Globe city council members declared an emergency, saying they have never seen anything like the flooding.</p><p>Scores of people have stepped up to volunteer, Gameros said, adding that many buildings in the community's downtown have been damaged. Officials asked people to stay away from the area until they could ensure it is safe to go in there.</p><p>"Our primary, again, is search and rescue," Gameros said Saturday.</p>

<div class="article-title">Eric Adams drops out of New York City mayor's race</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams is dropping his bid for reelection, setting up a three-way race between Queens Assemblyman and Democrat <span class="link">frontrunner Zohran Mamdani</span>, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent, and Guardian Angels founder and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa to lead America's largest city.  </p><p>Adams, who took office in January 2022, announced he was dropping out of the mayor's race in a video posted to his social media Sunday afternoon.</p><p>"Despite all we've achieved, I cannot continue my reelection campaign. The constant media speculation about my future and the Campaign Finance Board's decision to withhold millions of dollars have undermined my ability to raise the funds needed for a serious campaign," <span class="link">the city's 110th mayor said</span>. </p><p>There has been intense questioning about the future of Adams' campaign over the past few months. Most polls <span class="link">showed him with single-digit support</span>, well behind Mamdani, the Democratic nominee; Cuomo, an independent; and Sliwa, the Republican candidate.</p><p>The mayor previously blasted speculation that he would drop his reelection bid. <span class="link">In a Sept. 5 news conference</span>, he said he was "the only one that can beat [Zohran] Mamdani," <span class="link">insisted he was remaining in the race</span>, and referred to the Democratic frontrunner and former governor as "two spoiled brats."   </p>
<p>It has been <span class="link">a tumultuous year overall for Adams</span>. He has faced a <span class="link">federal corruption scandal</span> and criticism over <span class="link">his relationship with the Trump administration</span>.</p><p>"I was wrongfully charged because I fought for this city, and if I had to do it again, I would fight for New York again," he said in his video message. </p><h2>Mamdani reacts to Adams suspending campaign</h2><p>Adams' name will <span class="link">still appear on the general election ballot</span> in November, even though he suspended his campaign. He was running as an independent after sitting out the Democratic primary. </p><p>Mamdani, who <span class="link">defeated Cuomo</span> in the primary, spoke to CBS News New York's Lisa Rozner on Sunday evening, and initially repeated part of his earlier statement on Adams' departure from the race.</p>
<p>"Donald Trump and his billionaire donors can determine Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo's actions but they will not dictate the results of this race," Mamdani said, adding, "And what we have seen today is a reflection of the fact that New Yorkers know that Andrew Cuomo's agenda is Eric Adams' record. That's what he is running on. That's what we are going to feed on on Nov. 4."</p><p>Rozner asked Mamdani why he linked a call to President Trump and corruption in his earlier statement.</p><p>"Well, I think we have just seen time and time again Donald Trump speaking openly about the fact that he wants to change the contours of this race to stop our campaign," Mamdani said. "And he wants to do so because he is afraid of the fact that, unlike him, we won't just diagnose the issue of a cost-of-living crisis; we'll deliver on it, and actually make this a city that New Yorkers can afford, in stark contrast of what he has done since leading this country, which is throwing New Yorkers off of their health insurance, off of their SNAP benefits, make it even harder for them to afford this city."</p><p>Cuomo tried later Sunday to make it seem like it's a two-person race between him and Mamdani.</p><p>"If Mr. Mamdani were to succeed, New York would not be New York," Cuomo said. "The intolerance that Mr. Mamdani represents, the judgmentalism, the division that he causes among the people in New York, the city would be splintered."</p><p>Asked about the two-person race idea that Cuomo keeps pushing, Mamdani said, "Look, I can tell you that Andrew Cuomo wanted me to be his opponent in the primary and we beat him by 13 points. And so, I continue to be confident in our chances on Nov. 4 to actually deliver a city that puts working people first, and not one that has been led into this crisis by people just like Andrew Cuomo."</p><p>Sliwa said he's confident in his chances and doesn't buy into the notion that the race is now all about Cuomo and Mamdani.</p>
<p>"[It's] about time," the Republican said of Adams' exit from the race. "This soap opera has continued too long. So the price was right for Eric Adams. So he's on to something else. That clears the field. It's Zohran Mamdani versus Curtis Sliwa. Cuomo had a shot, he lost. So clear the field. It's law and order Curtis Sliwa. Turn [loose] the criminals Zohran Mamdani. Thirty-seven days to go. Let's get it on."</p><h2>Cuomo thanks Adams for his leadership</h2><p>Cuomo said in an earlier statement Adams' decision "was not an easy one," adding, "but I believe he is sincere in putting the well-being of New York City ahead of personal ambition. We face destructive extremist forces that would devastate our city through incompetence or ignorance, but it is not too late to stop them."</p><p>The former governor also credited Adams for fighting the good fight for as long as he has in the city, from his childhood up through his public service.</p>
<p>"Mayor Adams has much to be proud of in his accomplishments. Only in New York can a child raised in a tenement in Bushwick, who once worked as a squeegee boy and a mailroom clerk, rise to become mayor. Whatever differences we may have, Eric Adams' story is undeniably one of resilience, a testament to the spirit of this city," Cuomo said.</p><h2>New York leaders tout some of Adams' accomplishments</h2><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul released a <span class="link">statement </span>saying she was proud to work with Adams since he took office. </p><p>"During that time we have delivered much needed housing for New Yorkers, including the passage of the mayor's visionary City of Yes plan. We have connected more New Yorkers to mental health services and supportive housing. We've driven down crime in our subways and gotten illegal guns off the streets. I have been grateful for his partnership. He leaves New York City better than he inherited it and that will always be central to his legacy as mayor."</p><p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who represents the 8th Congressional District in Brooklyn, released a statement that said, in part, "Eric Adams has served courageously and authentically for decades as a member of the NYPD, the New York State Senate, in Brooklyn Borough Hall and as our 110th mayor. During his time in office, violent crime is down, the building of affordable housing units is up and New York City has recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>"As is the case in any major city, there are challenges that remain, particularly as it relates to lowering the high cost of living. Yet, it is clear that meaningful progress has been made in several important areas during the term of Mayor Adams. Thank you for your service to our city," Jeffries added.</p><p>The Rev. Al Sharpton said in a statement that Adams told him about his decision before releasing the video on Sunday. </p><p>"I told him I respected his decision," Sharpton said. "We have been friends for nearly 35 years, and he helped us establish National Action Network in 1991. He has been a friend of NAN year in and year out since, especially over the last almost four years he led City Hall. NAN remains focused on continuing our work of making New York City safe, livable, and prosperous for Black and Brown communities."  </p><h2>White House floated new job for NYC Mayor Adams</h2><p>Prior to the mayor dropping out, sources told CBS News New York that the White House was <span class="link">looking into possible government positions</span> to persuade him to exit the race.</p><p>Sources told CBS News New York's political reporter Marcia Kramer that during a trip to Florida, Adams met with Steve Witkoff, a New York real estate investor and close advisor to the president.</p><p>"While I will always listen if called to serve our country, no formal offers have been made. I am still running for reelection, and my full focus is on the safety and quality of life of every New Yorker," Adams said in early September, as speculation about his potential departure swirled. </p><p>The mayor called the reports just rumors. </p>
<p>"To say, would you take a job in the administration or would I take it somewhere else, that's hypothetical," Adams said on Sept. 3. "I'm running for office and I'm going to finish doing that. I got work to do."</p>
<p>President Trump said he wanted to see a one-on-one race against Mamdani, adding <span class="link">two of the candidates should leave the race</span> to make that happen, in hopes of uniting independent and Republican voters against the Democratic socialist. </p><p>Both Adams and Sliwa <span class="link">previously dismissed the suggestion</span> and vowed to stay in the running. Cuomo had said <span class="link">he would drop out if he wasn't leading in the polls</span> among the potential challengers to Mamdani heading into Election Day. Independent candidate <span class="link">Jim Walden already left the race</span>, although <span class="link">a court decided his name will remain on the final ballot</span> despite his dropping out. </p><p>Mamdani responded to what he called Mr. Trump's "meddling" in the race, calling it "an affront to our democracy." He later challenged the president to face him in a debate, saying, "Let's cut out the middleman."</p><h2>Trump administration squashed Adams' corruption case</h2><p>It was not the first time Mr. Trump put presidential pressure on New York City politics. Upon taking office earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Justice directed federal prosecutors in New York to <span class="link">dismiss their federal bribery case against Adams</span>.</p><p>The directive led acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York <span class="link">Danielle Sassoon to resign</span>, along with <span class="link">other members of her office</span>. </p><p>The charges were <span class="link">ultimately dropped with prejudice</span>, meaning they <span class="link">cannot be filed again in the future</span>. </p><p>Adams' political opponents <span class="link">repeatedly called on him to resign</span>, claiming he would be under the president's influence. The mayor remained defiant, <span class="link">insisting there was no quid-pro-quo</span> and <span class="link">launching his reelection campaign</span>. </p>
<h2>Adams administration dogged by corruption allegations</h2><p>Adams was accused of <span class="link">soliciting illegal campaign donations from wealthy and corporate donors</span> and using them to tap into matching election funds in the 2021 race. </p><p>As part of the investigation, he was accused of accepting lavish bribes, like flight upgrades and luxury hotel rooms, in exchange for his political influence once he got into office. He <span class="link">pleaded not guilty</span> and denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>The FBI <span class="link">raided several members of Adams' inner circle</span> last fall, leading to <span class="link">a flurry of resignations</span>. More of his administration <span class="link">stepped down this February</span>, and his <span class="link">longtime adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin</span> was <span class="link">indicted on new bribery charges</span> as recently as this August. </p><p>His former campaign fundraiser, <span class="link">Winnie Greco</span>, was also recently accused of <span class="link">handing a journalist an envelope of cash</span> inside a bag of potato chips. The mayor <span class="link">denied involvement with either incident</span>. </p><p><em>This is a developing story. Please stay with CBS News New York for updates. </em></p>

<p>Police in Grand Blanc, Michigan, say the gunman who <span class="link">killed at least four people and injured eight others at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</span> on Sunday morning died after "exchanging gunfire" with police.</p><p>The suspect was identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said. </p><p>Sanford served in the U.S. Marines for three-and-a-half years from 2004 to 2008, CBS News has confirmed. He was deployed from August 2007 to March 2008 as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, which <span class="link">led to the fall of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein</span>.</p><p>According to Renye, calls about the shooting at the Church of Latter-day Saints on McCandlish Road came in around 10:25 a.m., and officers were at the scene less than a minute later. Police said Sanford died at the parking lot of the church around 10:33 a.m.</p><p>Sanford lived around eight miles away from the church. Michigan State Police and a bomb squad were investigating his home throughout the evening on Sunday. </p>
<p>Investigators say there may be bomb making materials inside, though it's unknown if anything was found. </p><p>Nearby residents told CBS News Detroit they couldn't believe what happened in their small suburban community located about an hour northwest of Detroit.</p><p>"I really feel for the families, you know, even feel for the accused," resident April Vann said.

<div class="article-title">Police: At least 4 killed, 8 hurt in attack at Michigan church; suspect dead</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>At least four people are dead after a shooter opened fire at a church in Michigan during a Sunday morning worship service and then set it ablaze. Eight other victims have been hospitalized, according to police.</p><p>Worshippers were gathered at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on McCandlish Road in Grand Blanc Township around 10:25 a.m., Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said. That's when the suspect, identified as a 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan, drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church, exited his vehicle and fired "several rounds" of an assault rifle at hundreds of churchgoers, Renye said at a news conference.</p><p>Ten people with gunshot wounds were taken to the hospital, where two victims were pronounced dead. One victim was in critical condition and seven others were in stable condition on Sunday afternoon. </p><p>Renye said in an update on Sunday evening that two other people were found dead inside the church and that "some" individuals are still unaccounted for, though the exact number is unknown. Police did not say how those two people died.</p><p>Police said Sanford died after a Grand Blanc officer and a DNR officer "engaged in gunfire" with him in the back parking lot of the church. Records confirmed by CBS News show that Sanford was a Marine Corps veteran. Authorities have not confirmed his motive in the attack.</p>
<p>According to investigators, the suspect deliberately started a fire at the Latter-day Saints church at some point. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said the fire was started using some type of accelerant. Crews have since contained the blaze, but the church is considered a total loss.</p>
<p>The FBI is leading the case, which is now being investigated as "an act of targeted violence." </p><p>Michigan state police said Sunday evening that officers are continuing to response to other locations in the community after they received additional bomb threats. Law enforcement confirmed some suspected devices were located but did not provide additional details of where or what they were.</p><p>Officials have set up an on-site reunification site at a movie theatre on Trillium Circle Avenue. Anyone who needs to connect with someone who was at the church is asked to call the American Red Cross at 248-705-7352.</p><p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation is asking anyone with information to call 1-800-225-5324 or submit a tip here.</p>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ said in a written statement that it has been in communication with law enforcement and that it's thankful for the emergency responders who are helping the victims and their families.</p>
<p>"We are deeply grateful for the outpouring of prayers and concern from so many people around the world," the statement said. "In moments of sorrow and uncertainty, we find strength and comfort through our faith in Jesus Christ. Places of worship are meant to be sanctuaries of peacemaking, prayer and connection. We pray for peace and healing for all involved."</p><h2>Officials react to Michigan church shooting</h2><p>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer posted a written statement on social media that said, "My heart is breaking for the Grand Blanc community. Violence anywhere, especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable. I am grateful to the first responders who took action quickly. We will continue to monitor this situation and hold the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc close."</p><p>Grand Blanc Township police said at least 100 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents are responding to the shooting. FBI Director Kash Patel said on X that the agency is tracking reports of the shooting and that agents are at the scene to assist local authorities.</p><p>"Violence in a place of worship is a cowardly and criminal act. Our prayers are with the victims and their families during this terrible tragedy," Patel said.</p><p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she has received briefings about the incident.</p><p>"Such violence at a place of worship is heartbreaking and chilling. Please join me in praying for the victims of this terrible tragedy," Bondi said.</p><p>President Trump also said that he has been briefed on the shooting.</p>
<p>"The suspect is dead, but there is still a lot to learn. This appears to be yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States of America. The Trump Administration will keep the Public posted, as we always do. In the meantime, PRAY for the victims, and their families. THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY MUST END, IMMEDIATELY," Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post.</p><p>According to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, her agency is in communication with "interagency partners."</p><p>Noem added in a social media post on X that, "Sacred places of worship should never fear violence in America. I am praying for the victims of this heinous attack and their families."</p><p>The New York Police Department said early Sunday afternoon that it was deploying "additional resources to religious institutions across the city," in response to the shooting. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass also said Sunday that out of an abundance of caution, the Los Angeles Police Department will be increasing patrols at places of worship across the city. </p><p>The Grand Blanc Township Police Department said it will have counselors at its facility starting on Monday and through the rest of the week.</p>

<div class="article-title">Bad Bunny will headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Bad Bunny will bring his Latin trap and reggaeton swagger to the NFL's biggest stage next year: The Grammy winner will headline the Apple Music <span class="link">Super Bowl</span> halftime show in Northern California.</p><p>The NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Sunday that Bad Bunny will lead the halftime festivities from Levi's Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California.</p><p>The Puerto Rican superstar's selection comes amid another career-defining run: He's fresh off a <span class="link">historic Puerto Rico residency</span> this month that drew more than half a million fans and is leading all nominees at the Latin Grammys in November. He has become one of the world's most streamed artists with albums such as "Un Verano Sin Ti," an all-Spanish-language LP.</p>
<p>"What I'm feeling goes beyond myself," Bad Bunny said in a statement. "It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL."</p><p>In a short video posted by the NFL on Sunday, the 31-year-old artist is sporting a pava, a Puerto Rican straw hat, which is a nod to Puerto Rican mid-century farmers. It shows Bad Bunny sitting on a goalpost to the tune of "Debi Tirar Más Fotos." The song speaks to the reality that Puerto Ricans must leave the homeland if they are to thrive. It is a song that immigrants of all origins have embraced as an anthem.</p><p>The Super Bowl halftime show announcement comes on the heel of the superstar's final residency show at San Juan's El Choli. It was livestreamed on Prime Video and Twitch, breaking viewership records for a single-artist performance, according to Amazon Music. </p>

<p>The Village of Broadview said they've launched a criminal investigation after a CBS News Chicago reporter had a projectile fired at her vehicle by an ICE agent late Sunday morning.</p><p>Reporter Asal Rezaei said there was no active protest or protesters at the facility, and she was alone with no one around her at the time of the incident.</p><p>In a report filed with Broadview police, Rezaei said she was driving her truck with her driver's side window down, while approaching the 25th Avenue entrance to see if any activity was taking place, before leaving the area. </p><p>That's when she said a masked ICE agent, who saw her window down, shot a pepper ball about 50 feet from the inside of the fence, hitting her truck's driver's side panel, causing the chemical agents to engulf the inside of her truck.</p>
<p>Rezaei said the pepper ball left white powder on her windshield, and her face had "been on fire for at least the last 10 minutes or so." The chemical also caused her to vomit once outside of her truck, she said.</p>
<p>In her report, she said, "At this moment it's not really clear why that officer took a shot at me. My car has been here several times, although I did not identify myself verbally as a member of the press. There were no protests going on," said Rezaei. "There was actually nobody there except one other person that was a member of a fire department that was there checking in on the buildings around this area."</p><p>Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills responded to the incident in a statement, saying, "The Village of Broadview Police Department has launched a criminal investigation into an allegedly unprovoked attack on a CBS Chicago TV news reporter's vehicle by a chemical munition fired from the direction of U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement detention facility. The victim declined medical attention. The Broadview Police Department expects the full cooperation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security into our criminal investigation."</p><p>CBS News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security but has yet to hear back. </p>

<div class="article-title">Humberto strengthens to major hurricane in the Atlantic</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Hurricane Humberto rapidly strengthened over the weekend, reaching <span class="link">Category 5</span> strength on Saturday before fluctuating back down to a still-powerful Category 4 on Sunday. </p><p>A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm could bring life-threatening surf and rip currents to the area and portions of the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.</p><p>The storm is <span class="link">one of two systems</span> swirling over the western Atlantic that could potentially bring some downstream impacts to parts of the Southeast U.S. coast, from Florida to North Carolina, the director of the Miami-based hurricane center, Michael Brennan, said. The second system strengthened to <span class="link">become Tropical Storm Imelda</span> on Sunday, and is expected to dump heavy rain from the Florida coast up to the Carolinas.</p><h2>Hurricane Humberto forecast and path</h2><p>As of late Sunday night, Humberto was located about 430 miles south of Bermuda. It was moving northwest at about 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, with higher gusts, according to the NHC. </p>
<p>The storm is likely to remain a major hurricane for the next several days, forecasters said. A storm is deemed a "major" hurricane if it's a Category 3, 4 or 5 due to the potential for "significant loss of life and damage," the center says.</p>
<p>"Fluctuations in intensity are possible during the next day or so. Gradual weakening is expected after that, but Humberto is expected to remain a dangerous major hurricane for the next couple of days," the hurricane center said in an advisory Sunday.</p><p>Those along the U.S. East Coast could begin to see the effects of Humberto beginning Monday, with swells generated by the storm likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.</p><p>Humberto is the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. It comes on the heels of <span class="link">Hurricane Gabrielle</span>, which is not impacting land as it heads farther out into the Atlantic.</p>
<h2>Forecasters also tracking Imelda</h2><p>The hurricane center is also closely monitoring a second storm system over the northeast Caribbean in the Atlantic, which strengthened into <span class="link">Tropical Storm Imelda</span> on Sunday and is expected to become a hurricane Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p>Imelda was expected to bring "significant rainfall" to portions of Cuba and the Bahamas, both of which could see up to 8 inches of rain, the hurricane center said. It will also likely produce flash and urban flooding, with the possibility of mudslides in higher terrain across eastern Cuba.</p><p>Tropical storm conditions are possible in areas along the east coast of Florida on Monday, and heavy rainfall is expected into Wednesday morning across coastal areas of the Carolinas, the forecasters said.</p>
<p>There is also a possibility it <span class="link">could interact with Humberto</span> — a phenomenon known as <span class="link">the Fujiwhara effect</span>, in which two different storms converge and either join or spin around each other. But CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said such an outcome is not considered likely in this case.</p>

<div class="article-title">Tropical Storm Imelda threatens Southeast, expected to strengthen</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Tropical Storm Imelda formed Sunday in the western Atlantic and is forecast to strengthen over the next few days, bringing the threat of torrential rainfall to portions of the southeastern U.S. early this week, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center.</p><p>Imelda, the ninth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is forecast to become a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.</p><h2>Tropical Storm Imelda forecast maps</h2><p>As of 11 p.m. ET on Sunday, Imelda was bringing tropical storm conditions and heavy rains to the central and northwestern Bahamas, according to the NHC. The storm was located about 125 miles northwest of the Central Bahamas, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph.</p><p>Forecasters said the storm was expected to strengthen through Tuesday. Imelda was moving north at about 9 mph, according to the NHC. Rainfall from Imelda is likely to impact Cuba and the Bahamas through Tuesday.</p><p>The risk of significant wind impacts along the southeastern U.S. was decreasing on Sunday evening, though swells and high surf from both Imelda and <span class="link">Humberto</span> are expected to cause dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along the east coast of Florida and Georgia through Monday.</p>
<p>Imelda's center was expected to cross over the central and northwestern Bahamas Sunday before making its approach to the U.S. coastline. The Bahamas and Cuba are already receiving heavy rains from the system. </p>
<p>"Steady strengthening is forecast during the next several days," the hurricane center said.</p>
<p>Imelda is forecast to bring up to 8 inches of rain to Cuba and the Bahamas, with the possibility of flash and urban flooding and mudslides.</p><p>Then the area stretching from Florida's Atlantic coast north to the Carolinas could see heavy rain, the hurricane center said. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with up to 6 inches in some local areas, were forecast through Tuesday across parts of the coastal Carolinas.</p><h2>Tropical storm warnings and watches for Imelda</h2><p>A tropical storm warning was in place Sunday for the Central Bahamas, including Cat Island, the Exumas, Long Island, Rum Cay and San Salvador; and portions of the northwestern Bahamas, including Eleuthera, New Providence, the Abacos, Berry Islands, Andros Island and Grand Bahama Island.</p>
<p>A tropical storm watch that had been issued for part of Florida's east coast, from the Palm Beach-Martin County line to the Flagler-Volusia County line, was canceled Sunday afternoon.</p><p>The hurricane center warned "minor coastal flooding is possible" in some areas, with 1 to 2 feet possible from the Volusia/Brevard County Line in Florida up to the South Santee River in South Carolina if the surge hits during high tide.</p><h2>Imelda follows Hurricane Humberto</h2><p>Imelda comes on the heels of <span class="link">Hurricane Humberto</span>, which rapidly intensified to a major hurricane over the Atlantic on Saturday but is not expected to reach land. Humberto reached as high as a Category 5 on Saturday before fluctuating back down to strong Category 4.</p>
<p>Forecasters said last week there was a small possibility the two systems could interact, creating what is <span class="link">known as a Fujiwhara effect</span>, a rare phenomenon in which two different storms merge and become entangled around a newly formed, common center. However, they said it was not considered a likely outcome in this case.</p><h2>U.S. officials brace for Imelda</h2><p>South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster issued a state of emergency ahead of Imelda on Friday, writing that "while the storm's arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the ENTIRE state of South Carolina."</p><p>On Saturday, McMaster wrote on social media that the forecast had "improved" but that Imelda "still poses a significant threat to our entire state."</p><p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Friday it is also preparing for Imelda's potential impact. While the FEMA National Response Coordination Center has not yet been activated, FEMA is planning the potential requirements for staging bases in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic that would be stocked with meals, water and generators if needed.</p>

<div class="article-title">Oregon sues Trump administration over plans to send troops to Portland</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the president said <span class="link">he will send troops to Portland</span>, state Attorney General Dan Rayfield announced Sunday.</p><p>It comes after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sent a memo to Gov. Tina Kotek authorizing 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to the city of Portland, Rayfield said in a news release. The troops are to be deployed for 60 days to protect federal property "where protests are occurring or likely to occur," he said.</p><p>The lawsuit argued that President Trump lacks authority to federalize the National Guard. <span class="link">California filed a similar lawsuit in June</span> after the administration sent troops to Los Angeles.</p><p>"Oregon communities are stable, and our local officials have been clear: we have the capacity to manage public safety without federal interference," Rayfield in a statement. </p><p>"Sending in 200 National Guard troops to guard a single building is not normal. If you had a concern about safety at your own home, you'd make a few calls and fill the gaps — not call in an army. What we're seeing is not about public safety, it's about the President flexing political muscle under the guise of law and order, chasing a media hit at the expense of our community."</p>
<p>Mr. Trump posted on social media on Saturday that he had directed Hegseth to send "all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any other ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists."</p><p>In response to the lawsuit, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CBS News Mr. Trump "is using his lawful authority" to send troops to Portland, saying that troops are being sent to protect federal assets and personnel "following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters."</p><p>Local officials, including Gov. Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, have pushed back on Mr. Trump's comments and plans to send troops to the city.</p><p>"When the president and I spoke yesterday, I told him in very plain language that there is no insurrection or a threat to public safety that necessitates military intervention in Portland or any other city in our state, despite this, and with all evidence to the contrary, he has chosen to disregard Oregonian safety and ability to govern themselves," Kotek said at a virtual news conference on Sunday. </p>
<p>She said that there have been some demonstrations near a federal facility, but Portland police and federal officials there are capable of handling the situation.</p><p>"And when people cross the line ... there's unlawful activity, people are being held accountable," Kotek said.</p><p>In a statement to CBS News, a Portland Police spokesperson said there have been "an almost constant protest down at the ICE facility in South Portland," but did not comment on any arrests.</p><p>"The protest numbers have waxed and waned over time. Last night there were some people down there, and there are more tonight," the spokesperson said.</p><p>The governor called the deployment of troops unlawful and said that it will make residents less safe. </p><p>Kotek also said she has been in conversations with <span class="link">California Gov. Gavin Newsom</span> and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who's also dealing with the <span class="link">presence of federal agents in Chicago</span>.</p><p>"We are all concerned across our country that this is a abuse of power and we are all trying to figure this out together," Kotek said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Suspect in Dallas shooting was targeting ICE agents, acted alone, officials say</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The <span class="link">shooter who attacked</span> the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement <span class="link">facility in Dallas</span> was targeting ICE agents, federal officials said at a news conference Thursday.</p><p>Nancy Larson, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said a collection of notes found at <span class="link">Joshua Jahn's</span> residence showed an animus toward ICE agents and that he had been planning the attack for some time. Jahn legally purchased the 8mm bolt-action rifle used in the shooting last month, officials said.</p><p>Larson said that early Wednesday morning, Jahn was seen driving his car with a long ladder. Officials believe he used the ladder to access the roof of an office building near the Dallas ICE facility, from where he started firing at about 6:30 a.m. </p><p>Larson said he fired rounds the length of the building and intended to damage property, as well as hurt or kill ICE personnel.</p><p>The three victims were detainees inside one of the vans Jahn targeted, Larson said. One of them died, and the others are in critical condition. Officials did not provide any more specifics about the victims' identities.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Sept. 27, the man fatally shot was identified as 37-year-old Norlan Guzman-Fuentes by the Dallas Medical Examiner.  The two injured men have been identified by ICE as Jose Andres Bordones-Molina and Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez.</p><p>Larson said law enforcement personnel from multiple federal agencies put themselves at risk to move other detainees who were in the vans to safety.</p><p>The Dallas ICE office will remain closed on Monday, September 29, ICE said.</p><h2>Dallas ICE shooting suspect worked alone, authorities say</h2><p>Another note found at the suspect's residence said, "Yes, it was just me," Larson said.</p>
<p>She and Joseph Rothrock, the FBI special agent in charge of the Dallas field office, both said all of the evidence indicates that Jahn acted alone. Larson also said there was no indication that Jahn was a member of any group.</p><p>Rothrock said it was officers from the Dallas Police Department and Dallas County Sheriff's Office who found Jahn on the rooftop. He was dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p><h2>Gunman used apps that track ICE agents</h2><p>Marcos Charles, the ICE executive associate director for enforcement and removal operations, blamed "wild rhetoric" for what he said was a 1,000% increase in assaults on ICE officers.</p><p>Charles also said that Jahn used apps that track ICE agents as part of his planning for the attack. </p><p>"Anyone who creates or distributes these apps that is designed to spot, track and locate ICE officers, are well aware of the dangers they are exposing to law enforcement," Charles said.</p><p>Multiple <span class="link">apps have sprung up</span> in recent months to warn migrants of potential ICE operations and help them avoid arrest as the Trump administration increased its crackdown on undocumented immigrants. </p>

<div class="article-title">Eyewitnesses to Charlie Kirk's assassination call for civilized debate</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Two eyewitnesses to the assassination of Charlie Kirk say America must return to civilized debate — even if their viewpoints don't otherwise align.</p><p>Hunter Kozak was the last person to speak to Kirk. A self-professed liberal who posts political TikTok videos, Kozak attended the event at Utah Valley University this month, aware that he was in the minority of attendees and eager to debate the conservative Turning Point USA founder. </p><p>He was at odds with Kirk on many issues, going so far as to suggest Kirk's policy proposals harmed the country. But Kozak especially wanted to challenge Kirk on his claims that linked transgender people to mass shootings. As the two began their pointed exchange, a sniper from a rooftop fatally wounded Kirk, mere feet from where Kozak was standing.</p><p>Jeb Jacobi says he saw Kirk as an inspiration. The Utah Valley University student was at the event volunteering for Turning Point USA, the organization Kirk co-founded in 2012 to advocate for conservatism on college campuses. It was Jacobi's second time meeting Kirk, whom he admired for the campus debates that made him popular online. Before this month's event, Jacobi took a photo with Kirk, and he was sitting nearby when Kirk was shot.</p><p>Today, Kozak and Jacobi come together on one thing: Americans need to keep having civil conversations — especially when they don't see eye-to-eye.</p>
<p>"I think that one of the few things that we can agree on is this necessity for a conversation," Kozak told 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley. "I think that we need to remember that we still have to live with each other. That these are still our neighbors."</p><p>Kozak told 60 Minutes that Kirk's team had pre-approved his question for the event, and he was placed second in line to ask it. He said he feels a weight in being the last person to have spoken to Kirk.</p><p>"I don't really know how to grapple with that," Kozak said. "I mean, he's answered tens of thousands of questions, and I just, that was the first question I've ever asked him. We never talked before that."</p><p>Jeb Jacobi recalled running toward safety after the shooting, calling his family to recount what he had seen. "He's been shot," Jacobi recalled telling his mother. "I literally watched a bullet enter his neck, and I watched him die in front of me."</p>
<p>Jacobi said Kirk's murder likely brings together moderate Democrats and Republicans, even as it drives apart the more radical elements in both political parties.</p><p>"I think that there needs to be effective communication between both parties in order to find solid ground on this issue," Jacobi told Pelley.</p><p>On the first day classes resumed at Utah Valley University after the shooting, Utah Governor Spencer Cox visited the campus to speak with students, promoting a similar message of civility and coming together.</p><p>"I think it's important not to tell people they shouldn't disagree that there's something wrong with disagreement, or that disagreement is the problem," Cox told a group of students. "It's not the problem, right? It's how we do that, if that matters."</p><p>Hunter Kozak told Pelley he appreciates the governor's message of unity but is aware of how appealing the message of vengeance can be when coming from politicians.</p><p>"My advice would be more towards the voters who vote for those politicians," Kozak said, "to look at what you are enabling with your vote and recognize that you have a lot more control over the situation together as a community than you might think."</p><p><em>The video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer and edited by Scott Rosann. </em></p>

<div class="article-title">Utah's governor calls for civility and unity after Charlie Kirk's murder</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A lonely voice rose above the rancor after the murder of <span class="link">Charlie Kirk</span>. Spencer Cox, the Republican governor of Utah, may not have been familiar to many, but after the assassination in his state, he asked whether we could all "stop hating our fellow Americans." We wanted to hear more and we were surprised to learn the 50-year-old Republican has spent years campaigning for reconciliation. Cox is asking Americans to respect our differences, which, at this moment, is not universally admired in his own party.</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: I get accused on the right all the time of-- I just want people to have a "kumbaya" moment. I want people to hold hands and just hug it out. And we're done with that. We're done holding hands and hugging it out. I'm not asking anybody to hold hands and hug it out. I'm not asking for that. I'm trying to get people to stop shooting each other. That's it. And I think what I'm doing and what I'm saying is the best way to do that. Some people will disagree with that and that's OK. We should have these debates as a society. I'm not always right. I've made mistakes. Other politicians, I think, are making mistakes right now in trying to elevate the temperature. But, but I'm going to just keep having these conversations.</p><p>Scott Pelley: In this moment, what's at stake?</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Scott, I, I, I-- don't think it's hyperbole to say that the, the future of our country is at stake. This grand experiment that we embarked on 250 years ago, can we hold together?</p><p>Scott Pelley: And what if our politics cannot find the path to the brighter light?</p>
<p>Gov. Spencer Cox: That's the question I always ask. When I hear people say that, that we're at war. I say, "OK. And and and what? What does that mean? What is next? Who, who am I supposed to shoot now?"</p><p>The shot, September 10th, was the kind of attack now happening every couple of months or so. In April, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania and his family escaped after their home was <span class="link">firebombed</span>. In June, in theirhomes, two<span class="link"> Minnesota Democratic lawmakers</span> and their spouses were gunned down. A year earlier, on the campaign, it was <span class="link">Donald Trump</span> himself. When told this time it was Utah, Cox didn't believe it. But there it was on his phone.</p>
<p>Gov. Spencer Cox: The video was already out. There was no fog of war. There, there was no doubt what had happened. That terrible awful video that I wish I had not seen. I hate, again, social media, that almost every person in this country, including our young people, have seen that video on a loop over and over and over again. And I can't unsee it. I can't stop seeing it. Every time I close my eyes, that's what I see. </p><p>The governor sent an aide to the hospital, who reported that Kirk was dead. Cox dialed a number. </p>
<p>Scott Pelley: As you're calling the White House, what is in your heart?</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Just sickness. Nauseous. Disbelief. Anger. At this point, I'm very angry. </p><p><em>Gov. Spencer Cox (during press conference on Sept. 10, 2025): …to whoever did this, we will find you, we will try you and we will hold you accountable to the furthest extent of the law... </em></p><p>His anger was showing. </p><p><em>Gov. Spencer Cox (during press conference on Sept. 10, 2025): I just want to remind people that we still have the death penalty here in the state of Utah.</em></p><p>But when he searched for meaning, he recalled the suffering of both parties.</p><p><em>Gov. Spencer Cox (during press conference on Sept. 10, 2025): Our nation is broken. We've had political assassinations recently in Minnesota. We had an attempted assassination on the governor of Pennsylvania. And we had an attempted assassination on a presidential candidate and former president of the United States and now current president of the United States. Nothing I say can unite us as a country. Nothing I can say right now can fix what is broken. We just need every single person in this country to think about where we are and where we want to be. </em></p>
<p>Gov. Spencer Cox: I've been following, I've been studying political violence. And so I, I'm keenly aware when these things happen and I'm seeing, I'm seeing people get, get murdered, get attacked who are Democrats and Republicans and that's where it came from in that moment. </p><p>Scott Pelley: In the days after the murder, as you're trying to bring the country together, Steve Bannon, the philosopher of the MAGA Right, called you a national embarrassment.</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Yeah. I love free speech. I would give my life defending his right to say that about me. That's OK. We can have that debate. There are some people that think I am a national embarrassment. And that's OK too.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Who do you blame for the division? </p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: I do believe that social media is a cancer. And it is taking all of our worst impulses and putting them on steroids. It, it is driving us to division. It is driving us to hate. These algorithms that have captured our, our very souls. They've, they've captured our free agency. These dopamine hits that get our young people and our old people addicted to outrage and hate that serve us up on a regular basis are absolutely leading us down a, a very dark path. </p>
<p>A path through platforms that look like civil war, powered by algorithms, programs, written to amplify posts of rage. </p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: The algorithms are absolutely destroying us. Once they know what your political leanings are, then it's like a pack of wolves that just attack. We have this collective problem where- that we can't solve because we're all sucked in, and we don't know how to get out.</p>
<p>We met Spencer Cox in the capitol at the foot of the Wasatch Range in Salt Lake City. He was raised, one of eight, on a farm of modest means. He's a lawyer, devoutly Mormon, with three years left on his second term. His conservative record includes tax cuts, expansion of gun rights and restrictions on abortion.</p><p>Scott Pelley: You are a Republican but not a Trump Republican.</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Well, that, that depends. I did vote for him this last time. He…</p><p>Scott Pelley: But not in '16 or 2020.</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: That is also correct. And he gives me a very hard time about that every time we're, we're together. The tent is broad on the right. And I'm trying to show one way to do politics. </p><p>His way to do politics surprised many in 2020. Campaigning for governor, he refused to run negative ads. </p><p><em>Spencer Cox (campaign ad from 2020): I think you should vote for me. </em></p>
<p><em>Chris Peterson (campaign ad from 2020): Yeah, but, but really, you should vote for me.</em></p><p>Instead, he asked his Democratic opponent to join him on the air. </p><p><em>Spencer Cox (campaign ad from 2020):  We can disagree without hating each other. </em></p><p><em>Chris Peterson (campaign ad from 2020): And win or lose in Utah, we work together. </em></p><p><em>Spencer Cox (campaign ad from 2020): So, let's show the country that there's a better way. </em></p><p><em>Chris Peterson (campaign ad from 2020): My name's Chris Peterson </em></p><p><em>Spencer Cox (campaign ad from 2020): and I'm Spencer Cox, </em></p>
<p><em>Both (campaign ad from 2020): and we approve this message.</em></p><p>Cox took the message beyond Utah when, in 2023, he became chair of the bipartisan National Governors Association. There, he launched a campaign called "Disagree Better," and went back on the air. </p><p><em>(Disagree Better video from 2023) SPENCER COX: I'm Spencer Cox Republican governor of Utah, </em></p><p><em>(Disagree Better video from 2023) JARED POLIS: and I'm Jared Polis, Democratic governor of Colorado…</em></p><p>Twenty three governors from both parties joined "Disagree Better." </p><p><em>(Disagree Better video from 2023) SPENCER COX: Healthy disagreement means not assuming that the other side is deluded, misinformed or actively trying to overthrow America. </em></p><p>This month, Cox took the message to the University of Notre Dame. He's done more than 20 of these events nationwide, often with Democratic governors, including Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico.</p>
<p>Scott Pelley: Does Disagree Better mean that we should drop our differences and everybody meets in the middle?</p>
<p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Absolutely not. In fact, it's the exact opposite of that. Abortion is an issue on which we disagree passionately. And and yet, even though we have these very strong, it looks like a chasm between us, I think we would both agree that we should be doing more to take care of, of single moms. I think those are the types of things that we can agree on while still being pretty passionate about, about whether we think abortion should be legal or not.</p><p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham: And when you do that and we listen and we find that we-- there is some common ground, it-- it--reduces, right, lowers the temperature. It provides opportunity not just for discourse, but doing something.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Do governors understand something that Washington does not?</p><p>Both: Yes!</p><p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham: Yes. We're completely about results, not about rhetoric. </p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: We like to say that potholes aren't partisan. And governors do have to deliver actual results. I think there's, sadly, in in D.C. we've seen this performative politics, and, and, and much less substance.</p><p>Scott Pelley: There are some people watching this interview who are disgusted that you two are sitting together.</p>
<p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham: Well, we need courage over comfort. You know, I don't work for-- a partisan party. I work for every single New Mexican. </p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Yeah, I see her as an American before I see her as, as a Democrat or anything else. I think we need more of these conversations. I think we need them in our-- in our own homes, in our own neighborhoods, in our school boards, in our city councils all across the country. </p><p>The day Charlie Kirk was murdered, one of the first calls Spencer Cox received was from Democrat Michelle Lujan Grisham. </p><p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham: We should be condemning at every chance we get political violence. Our democracy falters when we don't. This is an American. This is a person. This is a person who lost his life in free speech. And there's real grieving for that family. And it doesn't end tomorrow. It will last a lifetime.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Says the Democrat.</p><p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham: Says the Democrat, because it's true. It's true.</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Please include that.</p>
<p>We returned with Spencer Cox to Utah Valley University.</p>
<p><em>Gov Spencer Cox (to crowd during Utah Valley University visit on Sept. 17, 2025): That flag, that doesn't represent any single group. It doesn't represent one part of our country and not another part of our country.</em></p><p>Students gathered where Charlie Kirk was killed. Cox told the crowd they can't count on politicians. Change, he said, must come from all of you.</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: I'm desperately looking for more architects and fewer arsonists. Again, it's so easy to burn down and tear down and-- and we've got too much of that today. I'm I'm hoping that a positive vision for our country, a positive vision for our party treating everyone with dignity and respect, that's how we get our country back.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Some people watching this interview might be thinking, "He should run for president." But the fact is you would never survive Republican primaries.</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: Well, the thought of, of-- running for president makes me nauseous. I I, have no interest in that. I'm glad that there are good people who are willing to do that. But-- that is not something I've ever been interested in. And you're also correct. The, the, way we select our candidates makes it almost impossible for someone like me to have an opportunity.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Is it possible that your message is naïve, that the violence will just continue?</p><p>Gov. Spencer Cox: That's-- that's very possible, that's very possible. I think the founders were naïve to believe that they could start a new country based on very different principles than virtually any country in the history of the world. I think that it was naïve that-- we could rebuild after a civil war had fractured us and we had killed 600,000 of our fellow Americans. So, I believe that naiveté with-- some passion can change the world. It's probably the only thing that ever has. </p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A Texas man accused of threatening to commit a shooting at a local pride event has been arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to court documents obtained by CBS News.</p><p>Joshua Cole of Anson, Texas, allegedly commented on a Facebook post containing details of an upcoming gay pride event in nearby Abilene, "fk their parade" and said he wanted to "pay them back for taking out Charlie Kirk," according to an affidavit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas on Sept. 19 — nine days <span class="link">after the conservative activist was shot and killed in Utah</span>.</p><p>Posting under the name "Jay Dubya," Cole also allegedly wrote, "there's only like 30 of em we can send a clear message to the rest of them."</p><p>When the Abilene Police Department made a traffic stop on Cole, he admitted he runs a Facebook account under the name Jay Dubya, and that he was behind the comments, the criminal complaint alleged. He told officers that he did not believe that the gay pride event should be allowed, according to the court document, but denied that he was going to shoot parade participants.</p><p>Cole also admitted that he has a firearm. It wasn't clear whether he legally owns it.</p>
<p>"The threats were not conditional. The threats were specific," FBI Special Agent Samuel C. Venuti wrote in the affidavit. "The threats were also specific to a particular set of victims: people participating in the gay pride parade tomorrow. With this level of specificity, COLE's comments were not mere idle or careless talk, exaggeration, or something said in only a joking manner."</p><p>Venuti wrote that he visited Cole's former employer who told him Cole had recently quit his job and "stormed out of the facility in anger." He had worked for the employer for over a year, Venuti wrote, and was described by coworkers as a "hot head."</p><p>"We want to reassure our community that the safety of everyone at Pride has always been, and will continue to be our top priority," Abilene Pride Alliance posted on Facebook over a week after the incident. "The swift action and continued diligence of APD and federal partners reflect their commitment to protecting our city and ensuring that Pride remains a safe, inclusive and celebratory space for all."</p><p>Abilene Pride Alliance said in the post that the organization asked for help to strengthen security at Pride and received over $4,000 in donations. </p>
<p>"We want to reassure our community that the safety of everyone at Pride has always been, and will continue to be our top priority," the post reads. "The swift action and continued diligence of APD and federal partners reflect their commitment to protecting our city and ensuring that Pride remains a safe, inclusive and celebratory space for all."</p><p>CBS News reached out to an attorney listed for Cole. He was booked into Taylor County Jail in Abilene on Sept. 19. He was previously arrested in 2019 on a terroristic threat charge, according to jail records.</p><p>Jail records show Cole was released from Taylor County Jail on Sept. 24. The next day, the court concluded that Cole must be detained pending trial for reasons including his prior criminal history, that the weight of evidence against him is strong and that his release poses "serious danger to any person or the community."</p><p>It wasn't immediately clear whether Cole had been released prior to the decision or whether he was transferred to another facility.</p>

<section class="content__body">
<p>Amir Amiri, an American citizen detained nine months ago in Afghanistan, was released Sunday and is on his way back to the United States, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced.</p><p>"Today we welcome home Amir Amiry, an American who was wrongfully detained in Afghanistan," wrote Rubio in a social media post. "I want to thank Qatar for helping secure his freedom."</p><p>A source with knowledge of the release previously told CBS News that Qatari diplomats had coordinated with the office of the U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs to facilitate it. After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, Qatar signed an accord to represent U.S. interests in the country. Before Amiri, it had helped secure the release of four other American citizens from Afghanistan earlier this year.</p><p>Amiri was detained in December 2024. Qatar began negotiating for his release in March, at first arranging a meeting between Amiri and the U.S. Special Envoy Adam Boehler during his visit to Afghanistan, according to the source with knowledge of his release. Qatari diplomats monitored Amiri's health and maintained close communication with U.S. officials throughout his detention, the source told CBS News.</p>
<p>Negotiations persisted for several months until Qatar reached a breakthrough this weekend, which resulted in Amiri's release, the source said.</p>
<p><span class="link">Two American citizens were freed</span> in a prisoner swap between the U.S. and the Taliban in January, one of whom, Ryan Corbett, had been abducted in 2022 while on a work trip.

<div class="article-title">Near the frontline, Ukraine's neurosurgeons are on the cutting edge</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>DNIPRO, Ukraine — Mechnikov Hospital is so old it treated wounded soldiers during the Crimean War in the 1850s.</p> <p>Yet the medical center in central Ukraine, just 60 miles from the frontline, plays a critical role in the current Russia-Ukraine war, where traumatic brain injuries are all-too-common. With a bit of help from some U.S. doctors, Ukrainian neurosurgeons are conducting state-of-the-art operations with cutting-edge equipment.</p> <p>When Ukrainian troops suffer life-threatening head injuries — and many do — this is where they want to come as fast as possible.</p> <p>"At Mechnikov Hospital, our rules say we need to start surgery in the first two hours after admission," said Dr. Andriy Sirko, the head of neurology who handles the most complex cases.</p>
<p>That's much faster than in many hospitals, especially those intended for civilians. Dr. Sirko has honed this process with some 2,000 war-related operations he's performed since Russia first attacked Ukraine in 2014. Most of those surgeries have come since Russia's full-scale invasion three-and-a-half years ago.</p> <p>The huge number of casualties, and the severity of the wounds, forced Dr. Sirko and his team to develop ways of rapidly handling brain injuries, most of them now caused by Russian drone strikes.</p> <p>"We implemented a new strategy, which we call early and comprehensive surgery," he said during an interview in his cramped office.  </p>
<p>Traditionally, a soldier with multiple brain injuries might endure several separate operations over many days. This could involve drilling a hole in the skull to relieve pressure from brain swelling, removing shattered skull fragments, and delicate repair work on damaged blood vessels. </p> <p>At Mechnikov, all this may be done in a single surgery.  </p> <p>"In one operation, we perform all stages," said Dr. Sirko. </p> <p>And to finish up, a partly missing skull can be replaced with titanium mesh and screws, he noted. </p>
<h3 class="edTag">A risky location</h3> <p>Proximity to the frontline means all this work may be done the same day a soldier or civilian is injured. But this has become more challenging.</p> <p>A decade ago, wounded troops could be flown to the hospital by helicopter. That's no longer possible because helicopters are now too vulnerable to Russian attack. The Russians also use drones to hit vehicles, which means injured soldiers sometimes have to wait until nighttime, when it's considered marginally safer to drive from the front to the hospital. </p> <p>The hospital itself is not entirely safe. A Russian missile crashed just outside the gates last October, shattering glass and shrouding the hospital, inside and out, in a cloud of dust and debris.</p> <p>Dr. Sirko's 27-year-old son, Dr. Bohdan Sirko, who's also a neurosurgeon, was operating on a wounded civilian at the time.</p> <p>"It was big bomb. There was a whistling of air. I never felt this before," said Dr. Bohdan Sirko. "When I opened my eyes, I was thinking, 'OK, maybe I'm dead.'"</p>
<p>The blast knocked down one of the nurses, but everyone survived — and he successfully completed the surgery.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">A hospital from the Russian Empire</h3> <p>This hospital in the central city of Dnipro was established in 1798. It's now a campus with several buildings, and it proudly boasts that one of them — still in use — treated injured Russian soldiers in the Crimean War, which ended with Russia's defeat to Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire in 1856. At that time, this region was part of the Russian Empire. </p> <p>Walking the crowded halls today is to travel through a time capsule from the Soviet Union.</p> <p>The main colors are dull gray and drab brown. Chairs are scarce and worn bare. The elevator groans as it strains to reach the next floor.</p> <p>Then you peak inside an operating room.   </p>
<p>"What I was amazed by is that they had so much more capability than what we had in Iraq and Afghanistan," said Dr. Rocco Armonda, a U.S. neurosurgeon. Dr. Armonda is also a retired U.S. Army colonel who spent more than a decade serving in the Middle East and at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington.</p> <p>He operated on hundreds of U.S. troops with traumatic brain injuries, learning and pioneering new techniques over the course of those U.S. wars. </p> <p>He describes Mechnikov Hospital this way: "It's like you transported Walter Reed within an hour of the frontline. They're so close to the battlefield and doing amazing, heroic work. Just for comparison, two days in Ukraine is equivalent to the worst month that we had in Iraq."</p> <p>Dr. Armonda, who's now at Georgetown University Hospital, has traveled to Mechnikov three times in the past two years. He assists on operations and hauls basic supplies to the hospital. He's also helped it acquire multi-million-dollar equipment.</p>
<p>This includes an angiography machine, which provides ultra-high resolution views of blood vessels in the brain, as well as advanced surgical microscopes.</p> <p>He's most impressed by what Ukrainian surgeons learned long-distance from Americans, and from their own war experience at home. </p> <p>"They took it one step further. They took devices that we would use to treat a civilian aneurysm emergency, and they applied it to wartime injuries," he said. "So their devices got much better over the 20 years since we were in Iraq and Afghanistan."</p> <p>In short, he added,  "I was teaching them some things. But I think I was doing a lot more learning than teaching,"</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Work that never ends</h3> <p>In his office, Dr. Andriy Sirko pulls out a plastic bag with shrapnel he's removed from the brains of patients. He pours the contents on his desk.</p> <p>An olive green piece of metal is the size of a credit card. The serial number on the shrapnel is clearly visible. The patient, Dr. Sirko said, survived and is doing reasonably well.</p> <p>Then he displays a tiny pellet, the size of a pea. This patient died, he explained. War is random. </p> <p>Outside his office, the hallway is now filled with patients and their family members waiting to see him. He has six more surgeries planned for the week. </p> <p>NPR's Hanna Palamarenko contributed to this story in Dnipro, Ukraine.</p>

<div class="article-title">Hundreds of Israeli soldiers were badly wounded in Gaza. Here's what saved them</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>PETAH TIKVAH, Israel — It's not uncommon in Israel today for a young man in his early 20s to be spotted on the streets with an amputated leg or serious wound.</p> <p>More than 500 Israeli soldiers have survived serious injuries fighting in Gaza, according to the military.</p> <p>Many of them endured catastrophic wounds that would have killed or maimed them in Israel's past wars, Israeli combat medics and surgeons say.</p>
<p>What has saved their lives? Medical advances, like drones delivering blood units on the battlefield, and lessons surgeons have learned treating many soldiers on the operating table.</p> <p>" If it was the last war, I would have ... lived all my life with one leg and one lung," said Nevo, a 25-year-old soldier who was badly wounded in an explosion in Gaza in late 2023.</p>
<p>Nevo is among several dozen soldiers whose limbs were saved by an Israeli civilian surgeon who has shared her medical experience in the war with top doctors at the renowned Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Nevo declined to give his last name, or be identified in photographs, in line with a new Israeli military protocol against publishing the identities of soldiers who served in Gaza to protect them from potential arrest abroad for alleged war crimes.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Drones delivering blood to the battlefield, and other advances</h3> <p>At an Israeli military base in late 2024, young soldiers presented new technology being used to treat wounded soldiers in Gaza.</p> <p>One soldier held up an Israeli-made drone, called Thor, which can drop bombs and also parachute units of blood from the sky, factoring in the wind direction, to reach wounded soldiers in Gaza.</p> <p>In past combat, Israeli combat medics treated wounded soldiers with freeze-dried plasma, but the military has now developed technology to quickly deliver whole blood, stored at the right temperature, to a severely hemorrhaging soldier in the battlefield. Whole blood, rather than freeze-dried plasma, is credited by the military with saving soldiers' lives.</p> <p>A portable device newly deployed in Gaza, developed by the Israeli military with Israeli biomedical company Inovytec, separates oxygen from the air to ventilate wounded soldiers without using pressurized oxygen cylinders that are not as safe on the battlefield.</p> <p>"There is a lot of new innovation," said Dr. Todd Rasmussen, a former U.S. Air Force surgeon and expert in military medicine, now at the Mayo Clinic. "We know that getting blood into patients who have lost blood as fast as possible is good to save life and limb. That was learned during the Second World War. But delivering that blood to medics by drones? That's very new."</p>
<p>Today, physicians treating soldiers in Israel and in Ukraine are sharing their experiences with surgeons in the U.S. Rasmussen calls it the "silver lining" of war.</p> <p>"A lot of these experiences and technologies or methodologies do get translated to the care of civilians," Rasmussen said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">How one doctor saved the limbs of 35 Israeli soldiers</h3> <p>Rasmussen's team at the Mayo Clinic has been in touch with Dr. Galit Sivak at Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Israel.</p> <p>Sivak has been sharing the method she's used during the Gaza war to save the limbs of 35 Israeli soldiers — including the 25-year-old soldier Nevo.</p>
<p>"He was badly wounded," Sivak said from her hospital office. "He had a lung injury ... he lost his teeth. And his leg was [a] really badly mangled extremity."</p> <p>The fierce nature of ground combat in the current Gaza war meant more limb injuries among soldiers compared to Israel's last ground offensive in Gaza in 2014. One advantage wounded Israeli soldiers have benefited from is the proximity to the battlefield — evacuated from Gaza by helicopter within about an hour to the operating table of a top-notch hospital in Israel.</p> <p>Sivak said she ditched the usual medical protocol of damage control when she received soldiers like Nevo, who had both a leg and lung injury.</p> <p>"It's written in the books that, leave the leg alone, and when his lungs are better, then you can deal with the leg. But the leg is not going to wait for you," Sivak said.</p>
<p>Sivak also saved the limbs of several Palestinian suspects badly wounded in Gaza and detained by the Israeli military. But since the war began, Palestinian civilians in Gaza have not had access to Israel's advanced medical system. Israel no longer permits Palestinian civilians wounded in Gaza to be treated at Israeli civilian hospitals.</p> <p>The medical system in Gaza has been severely battered by Israeli bombardment. The United Nations says Gaza has the highest number of child amputees per capita in the world. Health officials in Gaza say more than 4,700 Palestinians have had limbs amputated in the nearly two years of war.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Soldiers carry scars, some invisible, for the rest of their lives</h3> <p>Nevo, the soldier whose leg was saved by Dr. Sivak, regularly hears the booms of Israeli bombardment in Gaza from his home on a kibbutz near the Gaza border. Sometimes his windows shake.</p>
<p>His leg is missing large chunks of muscle, left behind on the battlefield in Gaza from the explosion that wounded him. But thanks to his medical care, he can do his CrossFit training, he can ride a bike, and is currently traveling in Asia.</p>
<p>"He can do everything with the leg. Maybe it's ugly, but it's good," said Sivak, his surgeon.</p> <p>Still, Nevo's mind often drifts to the moment in Gaza when Palestinian militants detonated explosives in a home, wounding him and killing two close friends in his army unit. He often thinks: Could the unit have acted differently so they'd be alive today?</p> <p>"You always think about them," Nevo said. "We think about what we did wrong, what we did right ... and we learn from it. But I cannot go back."</p> <p>Like many soldiers who have served in Gaza, he now has a large tattoo on his arm with the date of his injury — another permanent reminder on his body of the moment that changed his life.</p> <p>He is one of the many young soldiers carrying scars, some invisible, for the rest of their lives.</p>

<div class="article-title">Prone to winter depression? Starting light therapy now can help</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Have you noticed you're sleeping a little longer? Maybe you're experiencing a shift in appetite — craving more sweets or pasta. In autumn, our bodies sense the change in light as the dark winter months approach, which can help explain what you are feeling.</p> <p>As daylight diminishes, you may find your mood dimming, too. About 1 in 20 adults have Seasonal Affective Disorder — which is seasonal depression. And millions more experience a milder form of "winter blues."</p> <p>One way to fend it off is by using a light box, beginning in the fall.</p>
<p>"A lot of research has shown that using bright light therapy in the morning can be extremely helpful to reverse some of the symptoms of seasonal depression," says Dr. Dorothy Sit, a psychiatrist and Associate Professor at Northwestern University, who has studied bright light therapy.</p> <p>Typically, people sit in front of a light box, which emits bright light, every morning, for about 30 minutes, give or take. Sit says making it part of a morning routine is key. "If people use a light box every day they can experience an enduring effect throughout the fall and winter," she says.</p> <p>Sit points to an often-cited study that found light therapy is on par with standard anti-depression medications in relieving symptoms. Some people do both, taking medication and using a light box, and research shows the combination can be helpful. Studies point to improvements in symptoms within one week of starting light therapy.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Understanding our body clocks</h3> <p>Our bodies can be quite sensitive to changes in daylight because we rely on it to regulate our circadian rhythms and our sleep-wake patterns.</p>
<p>And because our internal body clocks don't keep a perfect 24-hour cycle, the master clock in our brains needs a daily reset. "Light through the eyes," is the cue for the reset, explains Michael Terman, a retired professor of clinical psychology and psychiatry at Columbia University.</p> <p>That's why exposure to morning light is so important. "What we are doing is resetting that drifting circadian clock to synchronize with the outdoor world," Terman explains.</p> <p>Terman is also President of the non-profit organization, Center for Environmental Therapeutics, which aims to educate healthcare professionals and the public about therapies to improve mood and health, focusing on non-medication treatments, including light boxes.</p>
<p>Terman says some models of light boxes sold online are either too small or don't emit enough bright light. His organization offers guidance on how to select a light box, and recommends purchasing models that meet the standards of devices tested in clinical trials.</p> <p><strong>A few things to keep in mind when starting use of a light box: </strong></p> <ol class="edTag rte2-style-ol"><li>Purchase a light box that emits 10,000 lux of light. (Lux is a measure of brightness.) </li><li>Larger screens are better, according to the Center for Environmental Therapeutics, because screen size influences light exposure."Smaller sizes increase the likelihood that small head movements reduce the 10,000 lux dose," the group says. </li><li>Adjust the angle of the light box. The light box should project downwards towards the eyes at an angle. This will help avoid a glare.</li><li>Start with 30 minutes in front of the light box and make adjustments based on how you feel. If you only get a little spurt of additional energy, you may want to increase to 45 minutes. Or if you feel jittery, that may be too much.  "Just as with a drug, light has to be dosed," Terman says. </li></ol>
<p>"I think bright light is still an underrecognized treatment option," says psychiatrist Dorothy Sit. And you don't need to be clinically depressed to benefit. Light therapy can be quite helpful for people who even have "milder forms," she says.</p> <p>So, If you're one of the many people who feels a dip in mood and energy beginning in fall, you may want to consider a light box, Sit says. But she also recommends that you talk to a healthcare provider about symptoms and treatment options.</p> <p>Also, keep in mind that a lack of light is not the only trigger of a low mood. If it's cold and snowy, people tend to go out less, says Dr. Jamie Zeitzer of Stanford University. "That can be depressing." He says light therapy won't help with the blues caused by social isolation, so remember to reach out to friends and stay engaged in activities that bring you into contact with others.</p>
<p>When it comes to feeling good in the coming darker months, we need light, as well as a handful  of habits that can help boost our moods, including laughter, friendship, a healthy diet, physical activity and exercise.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Scared of spiders? Some former arachnophobes now are keeping jumping spiders as pets</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>For Emily Hess, it was a Phidippus regius named Gretel. Hayden Shea's first was caught by her boyfriend's dad. Sunday Costell ordered her first one off eBay.</p> <p>Those spiders were the gateway bugs into the booming community of jumping spider pet owners. And thanks to social media videos of their head-tilting, leg waggling antics, these web-slingers are in high demand.</p> <p>"I went from selling three to four a week to thousands a week," said Costell, owner of Sundays Spiders outside Portland, Ore, who now has tens of thousands of "web puppies" in her shop.</p> <p>These could-be pests have made the leap to hugely popular pets, particularly with women, sellers say, noting some women get interested as they try to overcome their fear of spiders, while others are simply enchanted by their unexpected cuteness. As a result, breeders are being flooded with requests online as videos rack up millions of views.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of demand. I don't even post mine anymore. I just wait. I just go based on the DMs on my Instagram," said Shea, a breeder in St. Cloud, Fla.</p>
<p>There are thousands of different types of jumping spiders in the world, with 300 in the U.S. alone, according to the Bohart Museum of Entomology. They can jump up to a height of 40 times their body size, which is usually smaller than a penny.</p> <p>Phidippus regius, commonly known as the regal jumping spider, is the largest type found in North America. They live in trees, which means they usually hang out at the top of their enclosures. And if you lose one in the house, you should look up.</p> <p>The spiders come in a variety of colors, peachy oranges, inky blacks and white (which has been in high demand lately because they are rarer). And they shed their exoskeletons.</p> <p>"They could change drastically over their molts," said breeder Shea. "It's really interesting. Like I've had some that are white and they go completely dark."</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>From fear to favor</strong></h3> <p>Paradoxically, many jumping spider owners were terrified of spiders to begin with. That was the case for Hess, who has built a following of 1.6 million on TikTok showing off her brood of "spoods" (as the internet has affectionately nicknamed the spiders).</p> <p>"I live in Iowa. There's spiders everywhere. And I was afraid of them my whole life," said Hess. "And it was making things really inconvenient, because I couldn't go into a room if I knew there was a spider in there."</p>
<p>Hess, 40, started looking at spider pics to tame her fear. Then she learned that people kept them as pets.</p> <p>"I got my first jumping spider and just fell in love with her and really bonded and it just kind of changed how I felt about them in general. And it worked. I'm not afraid of spiders anymore," she said.</p>
<p>Arizona breeder Heather Mulligan had her first jumping spiders for two weeks before she built up the courage to handle them.</p> <p>"I told my husband I was going to get a jumping spider. He said, 'You're not. You're scared of spiders!'" said Mulligan, owner of Jumping Jewels AZ in Surprise, Ariz. "I was like, 'Yeah, but these ones are so cute.' So he went out of town for work and I got two."</p> <p>Now, Mulligan has a thousand of them that she breeds for sale – from pinprick-sized babies to big mamma spiders spinning egg sacks.</p> <p>And she has a lot in common with her customers.</p> <p>"Like 95% of my customers are female and they do not have the support of their partner," she laughed.</p> <p>Hess, who posts under the handle @mini_robomuppets, owns about a dozen jumping spiders, and each has a distinct personality.</p> <p>"There are some that are super outgoing and some that are really high energy, some that are just really relaxed," she said.</p> <p>Once people overcome the fear, "they fall in love with their little personalities," said Costell, the Pacific Northwest breeder.</p> <p>And that change in perspective can lead to different attitudes toward creepy crawlies, the breeders said.</p> <p>"Time and time again I get comments on social media from people that were arachnophobes and that killed every bug that they came across," said Andrea Traid, owner of Little Spoods. "After learning about jumping spiders (even when not inclined to keeping them), it made them have a different perspective about spiders and bugs and instead of smooshing them, now they grab a cup and put them outside."</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>The amazing spider</strong></h3> <p>Jumping spiders are smarter than you think.</p>
<p>They don't build capture webs, but pounce on their prey, said the University of Cincinnati's Nathan Morehouse, whose lab studies jumping spiders. To hunt, they have to interact with their surroundings.</p> <p>"These animals are working with a brain about the size of a poppy seed. So it's tiny. And the complexity of their behavior is surprising given how small their brains are," he said.</p> <p>They can have stellar eyesight, can make plans and even have a sense of the difference between one, two and three things.</p> <p>"They really do act like little cats in a certain way as they stalk things and play with things and move around," said Morehouse.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>But how does it work?</strong></h3> <p>They're popular, but far from a common household pet. Here are answers to some questions you might have about owning a jumping spider.</p> <p><strong>Are they hard to take care of? </strong>"They're a step up from a pet rock," said Mulligan. They require tiny enclosures – smaller than a shoe box – water and food (more on that below).</p> <p><strong>How much do they cost? </strong>A single spider can range from $30 up to around $100. There are many breeders online who can ship them. And PetSmart recently listed them for sale on its website, although the company did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p><strong>What do they eat? </strong>This could be the dealbreaker for many people. Spiders need live prey like tiny mealworms, cockroaches and fruit flies. Emphasis on the word <em>live.</em> Because of the way they consume the bugs, they can't be dried out. "They make their prey smoothie, basically, and then drink the inside. So you can't feed them anything like dried worms," said Mulligan.</p> <p><strong>Will they get lost? </strong>Breeders say they're about as likely to get lost as a hamster, maybe even less so. If you're handling them, they lay down anchor webs to your hands, so even if they leap away, they're still tethered.</p>
<p><strong>Do they bite?</strong> Yes, but not unless provoked. The spiders tend to bite people who stick their hands inside their enclosure, spooking the "spoods," according to breeders. "I've handled hundreds and hundreds of them at this point. I've never been bitten once," said Traid. And if you are bitten, it feels about the same as a bee sting.</p> <p><strong>How long do they live?</strong> About one to two years, although some breeders say they have spiders that have made it to their third birthday.</p> <p><strong>Can I pet them? </strong>Probably best not to, you might squish them. But if you're lucky, you can get a boop.</p>

<div class="article-title">Top Congressional leaders head to White House ahead of shutdown deadline</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The top four leaders in Congress are scheduled to meet<strong> </strong>with President Trump this afternoon at the White House, just ahead of a September 30 deadline to fund the government and avoid a shutdown.</p> <p>The Oval Office meeting with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is set to occur ahead of an expected Senate vote on a short-term stopgap bill.</p> <p>House Republicans narrowly passed a continuing resolution earlier this month that would fund the government through November 21. That measure failed in the Senate because of Democratic opposition. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the chamber; they need 60 votes to pass the legislation.</p>
<p>"We are resolute in our determination to avoid a government shutdown and address the Republican healthcare crisis. Time is running out," said Jeffries and Schumer Saturday in a statement regarding the White House meeting.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A meeting redo</h3> <p>Monday's Oval Office meeting comes after President Trump abruptly canceled a planned meeting last week with the two Democratic leaders.</p> <p>"After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive," Trump posted on social media.</p> <p>Democrats are pushing to make permanent expanded tax cuts from the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year, and repeal cuts to healthcare programs that were put in place as part of the GOP's spending and tax bill bill passed earlier this summer.</p> <p>Republicans are pushing to fund the government first, and then negotiate on the subsidies.</p> <p>"[The expiry date] doesn't happen until the end of the year. We can have that conversation," said Thune Sunday on NBC's <em>Meet the Press. </em>"But before we do, release the hostage, set the American people free, keep the government open and let's have a conversation about those premium tax credits. I'm certainly open to that."</p>
<p>But top Democrats have repeatedly said a handshake agreement on a future negotiation about the subsidies isn't enough.</p> <p>"We need a serious negotiation," Schumer said in a separate appearance on Sunday's <em>Meet the Press. </em>"Now, if the president at this meeting is going to rant and just yell at Democrats and talk about all his alleged grievances and say this, that and the other thing, we won't get anything done. But my hope is it will be a serious negotiation."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Clock is ticking</h3> <p>Without Congressional action, government funding will expire at 12:01 am on<strong> </strong>Oct. 1.</p> <p>While critical services would continue, like Social Security and payments from Medicare and Medicaid, there could be delays in processing new applications for those programs.</p> <p>In a shutdown, anything deemed nonessential is put on hold, so Americans could experience delays in certain services and hundreds of thousands of federal workers will go without pay.</p> <p>In a move to seemingly raise the stakes, the White House's budget arm instructed federal agencies to prepare to lay off workers permanently, instead of the traditional temporary furlough.</p> <p>Congressional Democrats panned the memo as an intimidation tactic.</p> <p>"This is nothing less than mafia-style blackmail," Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told NPR. "Essentially, the president is threatening to fire dedicated federal employees who have nothing to do with the ongoing political and policy dispute."</p> <p>If the administration makes good on its threat, it could mean that whenever the federal government does reopen, it would have a smaller workforce.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">She felt abandoned — until a teacher's hug reminded her she wasn't alone</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p><em>This story is part of the My Unsung Hero series, from the Hidden Brain team. It features stories of people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone else.</em></p> <p>When Tanya Eby was in sixth grade, her friends made a decision that stunned and devastated her.</p> <p>"The girls that I hung out with for lunch and played with had held a meeting and told me that I was no longer cool enough to hang out with them," Eby recalled.</p> <p>"They would be ignoring me, and I was no longer part of the group."</p>
<p>Eby's world was unraveling — but the loss of her friends was only part of the story. A few days later, she broke down in tears while in class, and her teacher, Mrs. Welch, pulled her into the teachers' lounge to find out what was wrong.</p> <p>"And I told her about the girls. But then I told her the rest of the story," Eby said.</p> <p>"And the rest of the story was, a few months prior to this happening, my mom and my stepdad decided my big brother — my anchor in life — needed to go live with my dad. So, overnight they took him and they dropped him off with my dad. So I woke up one morning and my brother was gone."</p>
<p>Not long after, her stepdad left too. So, when the girls at school decided they weren't going to be friends with her anymore, it was just the latest example of the people she cared about leaving without warning.</p> <p>"It felt like everywhere I turned, people I loved disappeared," Eby said. "They stopped loving me and they didn't tell me why and I had no control over it."</p> <p>Eby cried as she told the whole story to Welch.</p> <p>"And in a moment that I'll remember forever, she just said, 'Oh, honey,'" Eby recalled. "She pulled me close to her and she hugged me. That's it. She hugged me and she let me cry. And somehow her hug centered me. It rooted me and it made me feel that I would be OK."</p>
<p>School ended and a few years later, Eby reconnected with her brother. She never saw Welch again. But Eby said that around 2002, when she began to teach writing to college students, she realized that her teacher's small act of caring had left a lasting mark.</p>
<p>"It helped me have empathy for students and understand that there were likely many things they were working through," she said.</p> <p>"And even if you don't understand the reason for their pain or maybe it seems superficial — like girls breaking up with you — there are sometimes deeper things happening that you don't understand," Eby said. "Just simply being seen, being listened to, is enough."</p> <p>Eby still returns to Welch's quiet gesture, more than 40 years after that day in sixth grade.</p> <p> "That one moment ... affected my whole life and I think it's had an effect on others' lives, too," Eby said.</p> <p>"Kindness isn't always just these big acts, but very tiny moments of connection that can change someone completely.  So my deepest thanks to Mrs. Welch."</p> <p><em>My Unsung Hero is also a podcast</em><em> — new episodes are released every Tuesday.

<div class="article-title">Neglected form of diabetes with unusual symptoms finally gets its own name</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>In the early 1950s, British physician Philip Hugh-Jones was flummoxed by 13 patients who showed up at the diabetes clinic he ran near Kingston, Jamaica.</p> <p>At the time, researchers broadly recognized two kinds of diabetes, known today as Type 1 and Type 2. Hugh-Jones himself coined those terms in a study of hundreds of patients published in 1955.</p> <p>Most of his patients fell into those two buckets, but that group of 13 people didn't fit into either category, says Michael Boyne, an endocrinologist at the University of the West Indies, where Hugh-Jones did his research.</p> <p>"They were relatively young, thin and kind of undernourished looking," says Boyne.</p>
<p>Normally, that would point to Type 1 diabetes, where individuals are unable to make their own insulin and can become underweight. </p> <p>But these 13 patients never experienced a common symptom of Type 1  — ketoacidosis. That occurs when the body runs out of insulin and starts burning fat for fuel, which can lead the blood to become dangerously acidic.</p> <p>"Even though they were thin, they never developed keto[acidosis]," says Boyne, seemingly ruling out Type 1 diabetes. But they didn't seem to be Type 2 diabetics either, who tend to be overweight.</p> <p>"So he said, 'Huh, these guys are different. They don't fit Type 1 or 2,'" says Boyne. "So he called them Type J." That's "J" for Jamaica. </p> <p>The name didn't stick. Subsequent names didn't stick either, despite cases of this unusual form of diabetes continuing to surface, especially in areas afflicted with malnutrition. Now, 70 years later, an international team of researchers is trying to formalize a new name — Type 5 diabetes.</p> <p>"The time is ripe" to recognize this disease that could impact as many as 25 million people," says Dr. Meredith Hawkins, a diabetes researcher at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.</p> <p>In April, the International Diabetes Federation adopted the new name. Now, in a perspective published in <em>The</em> <em>Lancet Global Health</em>, Hawkins and an international team of researchers are urging other entities, including the World Health Organization, to get on board too.</p>
<p>"It is important, from a scientific perspective, to give it a name," says Nihal Thomas, an endocrinologist at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, India, who is part of the effort. "And patients will benefit a lot," he said, since some are getting treatment that can be deadly.</p> <h3 class="edTag">The dangers of not having a name</h3> <p>After Hugh-Jones published his 1955 paper, researchers around the globe started noticing similar cases that didn't fit Type 1 or Type 2.</p> <p>"It had a variety of names over time, but they were all generally describing the same thing," says Boyne. "And in Southeast Asia, India and Africa, they really noticed a strong connection with malnutrition in early life."</p> <p>Hawkins herself first saw this unusual form of diabetes while working in Uganda in the early 2000s.</p> <p>"A lot of very impoverished patients that were coming in from rural areas, very thin and malnourished, very high blood sugars," she says. They'd exhibit classic symptoms of diabetes, including frequent urination, excessive thirst or hunger, and even nerve damage.</p> <p>To most clinicians, including Hawkins at the time, such patients seem like classic Type 1 cases. The standard treatment would be to send them home with a lot of insulin. But she and her colleagues soon learned that this approach could be lethal.</p> <p>"Basically, in many cases, committing them to a death sentence from low blood sugar," if they didn't have enough food to eat at home, she says. Insulin is a hormone that helps shuttle sugar from the blood into cells, where it can be used for energy. Too much insulin, coupled with too little food, can result in dangerously low blood sugar, she says.</p> <p>Seeing such cases of "young people who had died from low blood sugar because they weren't being appropriately treated really motivated our research," says Hawkins.</p> <h3 class="edTag">What makes Type 5 diabetes different</h3> <p>Since then, she and other researchers have learned that physiologically, people with Type 5 diabetes look different from those with Type 1 or 2. Those differences seem to be shaped by malnutrition.</p>
<p>"These individuals have generally had malnutrition from the time they were in utero," says Hawkins. "They're malnourished as toddlers, as children, as adolescents and as adults. These are the ones that don't catch up. They just stay very thin, and that makes them different than other forms of diabetes."</p> <p>One key difference is the pancreas, where insulin gets produced. Evidence suggests that malnutrition in early development harms the ability of the pancreas to pump out insulin.</p> <p>"Their pancreas is crap," says Boyne. "It's not as bad as Type 1, but it's really crappy."</p> <p>That leaves people with Type 5 diabetes in a weird spot. They can produce some insulin and their cells respond to it (unlike people with Type 2 diabetes, whose cells are often resistant to insulin), but they can't make quite enough to normally regulate their blood sugar.</p> <p>"We felt very strongly that if this was a separate entity, it needed separate treatment," says Hawkins. Figuring out the best treatment will take more research, she says, something she hopes the new name can galvanize.</p> <p>Not everyone in the diabetes research community is convinced that Type 5 diabetes is a distinct entity or that it deserves a new name.</p> <p>"Formal classification risks codifying what may be a spectrum of poorly characterized Type 2 diabetes rather than a discrete entity," says Anoop Misra, an endocrinologist at the Centre of Nutrition &amp; Metabolic Research in New Delhi. He says the existing data isn't enough to definitively establish a distinct form of diabetes.</p> <p>The International Diabetes Federation disagrees, though, and launched a working group aimed at developing better diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines for Type 5 diabetes. (It chose the name Type 5 as uncontested territory, since there are ongoing efforts to label other forms of diabetes as Types 3 and 4.) Advocates hope recognition by other health authorities, including the World Health Organization, could help that effort, at a time when cases are poised to rise in some parts of the globe.</p>
<p>Food crises in Gaza, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Yemen could be setting up a generation for increased risk of Type 5 diabetes, says Boyne.</p> <p>"It's really heart-rending," he says. "This is something that's preventable — it's preventable by food."</p>

<p>Puerto Rican rapper and singer Bad Bunny will headline next year's Super Bowl halftime show.</p> <p>The National Football League, Apple Music and Roc Nation made the announcement during halftime of Sunday night's game between the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys.</p>
<p>"What I'm feeling goes beyond myself," Bad Bunny said in a statement released by the NFL. "It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history.

<p>Born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, the 31-year-old superstar said in an interview earlier in September that he chose not to do any concert dates in the 50 U.S. states during his current world tour.

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Police say they are investigating the death of a stowaway found Sunday morning inside the landing gear compartment of an American Airlines flight that had recently arrived in Charlotte, N.C., from Europe.</p> <p>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police said maintenance staff discovered the body shortly after 9 a.m. Sunday while servicing the aircraft. Officers from CMPD's Airport Division pronounced the individual dead at the scene. Homicide detectives and crime scene teams responded, and the Mecklenburg County Medical Examiner's Office will conduct an autopsy.</p>
<p>In a brief statement, a spokesperson for American Airlines confirmed the discovery to NPR, adding the airline was "working with law enforcement on its investigation."</p> <p>There were no immediate details about the stowaway's identity, how they entered the plane, or from what city in Europe the flight originated.</p> <p>Cases of stowaways hiding in wheel wells are rare but not unprecedented — and survival is rarer still.</p> <p>Last week, a 13-year-old boy miraculously survived a 90-minute Kam Air flight from Kabul to Delhi, after he slipped into the plane's landing gear compartment. The boy, who was repatriated back to Afghanistan, told local authorities he had wandered into the compartment out of curiosity.</p> <p>Other incidents have ended in tragedy. In January, two bodies were found in the landing gear of a JetBlue aircraft that had landed in Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>Experts say freezing temperatures, extreme wind chill and a lack of oxygen make survival during long flights in wheel wells highly unlikely.</p> <p>The Charlotte case remains under investigation. Anyone with information is asked to call the CMPD Homicide Unit at 704-432-8477 or leave an anonymous tip through Charlotte Crime Stoppers.</p>
