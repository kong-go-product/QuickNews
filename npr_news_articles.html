                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>

<p>DNIPRO, Ukraine — Mechnikov Hospital is so old it treated wounded soldiers during the Crimean War in the 1850s.</p> <p>Yet the medical center in central Ukraine, just 60 miles from the frontline, plays a critical role in the current Russia-Ukraine war, where traumatic brain injuries are all-too-common. With a bit of help from some U.S. doctors, Ukrainian neurosurgeons are conducting state-of-the-art operations with cutting-edge equipment.</p> <p>When Ukrainian troops suffer life-threatening head injuries — and many do — this is where they want to come as fast as possible.</p> <p>"At Mechnikov Hospital, our rules say we need to start surgery in the first two hours after admission," said Dr. Andriy Sirko, the head of neurology who handles the most complex cases.</p>
<p>That's much faster than in many hospitals, especially those intended for civilians. Dr. Sirko has honed this process with some 2,000 war-related operations he's performed since Russia first attacked Ukraine in 2014. Most of those surgeries have come since Russia's full-scale invasion three-and-a-half years ago.</p> <p>The huge number of casualties, and the severity of the wounds, forced Dr. Sirko and his team to develop ways of rapidly handling brain injuries, most of them now caused by Russian drone strikes.</p> <p>"We implemented a new strategy, which we call early and comprehensive surgery," he said during an interview in his cramped office.  </p>
<p>Traditionally, a soldier with multiple brain injuries might endure several separate operations over many days. This could involve drilling a hole in the skull to relieve pressure from brain swelling, removing shattered skull fragments, and delicate repair work on damaged blood vessels. </p> <p>At Mechnikov, all this may be done in a single surgery.  </p> <p>"In one operation, we perform all stages," said Dr. Sirko. </p> <p>And to finish up, a partly missing skull can be replaced with titanium mesh and screws, he noted. </p>
<h3 class="edTag">A risky location</h3> <p>Proximity to the frontline means all this work may be done the same day a soldier or civilian is injured. But this has become more challenging.</p> <p>A decade ago, wounded troops could be flown to the hospital by helicopter. That's no longer possible because helicopters are now too vulnerable to Russian attack. The Russians also use drones to hit vehicles, which means injured soldiers sometimes have to wait until nighttime, when it's considered marginally safer to drive from the front to the hospital. </p> <p>The hospital itself is not entirely safe. A Russian missile crashed just outside the gates last October, shattering glass and shrouding the hospital, inside and out, in a cloud of dust and debris.</p> <p>Dr. Sirko's 27-year-old son, Dr. Bohdan Sirko, who's also a neurosurgeon, was operating on a wounded civilian at the time.</p> <p>"It was big bomb. There was a whistling of air. I never felt this before," said Dr. Bohdan Sirko. "When I opened my eyes, I was thinking, 'OK, maybe I'm dead.'"</p>
<p>The blast knocked down one of the nurses, but everyone survived — and he successfully completed the surgery.</p> 
<h3 class="edTag">A hospital from the Russian Empire</h3> <p>This hospital in the central city of Dnipro was established in 1798. It's now a campus with several buildings, and it proudly boasts that one of them — still in use — treated injured Russian soldiers in the Crimean War, which ended with Russia's defeat to Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire in 1856. At that time, this region was part of the Russian Empire. </p> <p>Walking the crowded halls today is to travel through a time capsule from the Soviet Union.</p> <p>The main colors are dull gray and drab brown. Chairs are scarce and worn bare. The elevator groans as it strains to reach the next floor.</p> <p>Then you peak inside an operating room.   </p>
<p>"What I was amazed by is that they had so much more capability than what we had in Iraq and Afghanistan," said Dr. Rocco Armonda, a U.S. neurosurgeon. Dr. Armonda is also a retired U.S. Army colonel who spent more than a decade serving in the Middle East and at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington.</p> <p>He operated on hundreds of U.S. troops with traumatic brain injuries, learning and pioneering new techniques over the course of those U.S. wars. </p> <p>He describes Mechnikov Hospital this way: "It's like you transported Walter Reed within an hour of the frontline. They're so close to the battlefield and doing amazing, heroic work. Just for comparison, two days in Ukraine is equivalent to the worst month that we had in Iraq."</p> <p>Dr. Armonda, who's now at Georgetown University Hospital, has traveled to Mechnikov three times in the past two years. He assists on operations and hauls basic supplies to the hospital. He's also helped it acquire multi-million-dollar equipment.</p>
<p>This includes an angiography machine, which provides ultra-high resolution views of blood vessels in the brain, as well as advanced surgical microscopes.</p> <p>He's most impressed by what Ukrainian surgeons learned long-distance from Americans, and from their own war experience at home. </p> <p>"They took it one step further. They took devices that we would use to treat a civilian aneurysm emergency, and they applied it to wartime injuries," he said. "So their devices got much better over the 20 years since we were in Iraq and Afghanistan."</p> <p>In short, he added,  "I was teaching them some things. But I think I was doing a lot more learning than teaching,"</p> 
<h3 class="edTag">Work that never ends</h3> <p>In his office, Dr. Andriy Sirko pulls out a plastic bag with shrapnel he's removed from the brains of patients. He pours the contents on his desk.</p> <p>An olive green piece of metal is the size of a credit card. The serial number on the shrapnel is clearly visible. The patient, Dr. Sirko said, survived and is doing reasonably well.</p> <p>Then he displays a tiny pellet, the size of a pea. This patient died, he explained. War is random. </p> <p>Outside his office, the hallway is now filled with patients and their family members waiting to see him. He has six more surgeries planned for the week. </p> <p>NPR's Hanna Palamarenko contributed to this story in Dnipro, Ukraine.</p>

                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>

<p>PETAH TIKVAH, Israel — It's not uncommon in Israel today for a young man in his early 20s to be spotted on the streets with an amputated leg or serious wound.</p> <p>More than 500 Israeli soldiers have survived serious injuries fighting in Gaza, according to the military.</p> <p>Many of them endured catastrophic wounds that would have killed or maimed them in Israel's past wars, Israeli combat medics and surgeons say.</p>
<p>What has saved their lives? Medical advances, like drones delivering blood units on the battlefield, and lessons surgeons have learned treating many soldiers on the operating table.</p> <p>" If it was the last war, I would have ... lived all my life with one leg and one lung," said Nevo, a 25-year-old soldier who was badly wounded in an explosion in Gaza in late 2023.</p> 
<p>Nevo is among several dozen soldiers whose limbs were saved by an Israeli civilian surgeon who has shared her medical experience in the war with top doctors at the renowned Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Nevo declined to give his last name, or be identified in photographs, in line with a new Israeli military protocol against publishing the identities of soldiers who served in Gaza to protect them from potential arrest abroad for alleged war crimes.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Drones delivering blood to the battlefield, and other advances</h3> <p>At an Israeli military base in late 2024, young soldiers presented new technology being used to treat wounded soldiers in Gaza.</p> <p>One soldier held up an Israeli-made drone, called Thor, which can drop bombs and also parachute units of blood from the sky, factoring in the wind direction, to reach wounded soldiers in Gaza.</p> <p>In past combat, Israeli combat medics treated wounded soldiers with freeze-dried plasma, but the military has now developed technology to quickly deliver whole blood, stored at the right temperature, to a severely hemorrhaging soldier in the battlefield. Whole blood, rather than freeze-dried plasma, is credited by the military with saving soldiers' lives.</p> <p>A portable device newly deployed in Gaza, developed by the Israeli military with Israeli biomedical company Inovytec, separates oxygen from the air to ventilate wounded soldiers without using pressurized oxygen cylinders that are not as safe on the battlefield.</p> <p>"There is a lot of new innovation," said Dr. Todd Rasmussen, a former U.S. Air Force surgeon and expert in military medicine, now at the Mayo Clinic. "We know that getting blood into patients who have lost blood as fast as possible is good to save life and limb. That was learned during the Second World War. But delivering that blood to medics by drones? That's very new."</p>
<p>Today, physicians treating soldiers in Israel and in Ukraine are sharing their experiences with surgeons in the U.S. Rasmussen calls it the "silver lining" of war.</p> <p>"A lot of these experiences and technologies or methodologies do get translated to the care of civilians," Rasmussen said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">How one doctor saved the limbs of 35 Israeli soldiers</h3> <p>Rasmussen's team at the Mayo Clinic has been in touch with Dr. Galit Sivak at Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Israel.</p> <p>Sivak has been sharing the method she's used during the Gaza war to save the limbs of 35 Israeli soldiers — including the 25-year-old soldier Nevo.</p> 
<p>"He was badly wounded," Sivak said from her hospital office. "He had a lung injury ... he lost his teeth. And his leg was [a] really badly mangled extremity."</p> <p>The fierce nature of ground combat in the current Gaza war meant more limb injuries among soldiers compared to Israel's last ground offensive in Gaza in 2014. One advantage wounded Israeli soldiers have benefited from is the proximity to the battlefield — evacuated from Gaza by helicopter within about an hour to the operating table of a top-notch hospital in Israel.</p> <p>Sivak said she ditched the usual medical protocol of damage control when she received soldiers like Nevo, who had both a leg and lung injury.</p> <p>"It's written in the books that, leave the leg alone, and when his lungs are better, then you can deal with the leg. But the leg is not going to wait for you," Sivak said.</p>
<p>Sivak also saved the limbs of several Palestinian suspects badly wounded in Gaza and detained by the Israeli military. But since the war began, Palestinian civilians in Gaza have not had access to Israel's advanced medical system. Israel no longer permits Palestinian civilians wounded in Gaza to be treated at Israeli civilian hospitals.</p> <p>The medical system in Gaza has been severely battered by Israeli bombardment. The United Nations says Gaza has the highest number of child amputees per capita in the world. Health officials in Gaza say more than 4,700 Palestinians have had limbs amputated in the nearly two years of war.</p> 
<h3 class="edTag">Soldiers carry scars, some invisible, for the rest of their lives</h3> <p>Nevo, the soldier whose leg was saved by Dr. Sivak, regularly hears the booms of Israeli bombardment in Gaza from his home on a kibbutz near the Gaza border. Sometimes his windows shake.</p>
<p>His leg is missing large chunks of muscle, left behind on the battlefield in Gaza from the explosion that wounded him. But thanks to his medical care, he can do his CrossFit training, he can ride a bike, and is currently traveling in Asia.</p>
<p>"He can do everything with the leg. Maybe it's ugly, but it's good," said Sivak, his surgeon.</p> <p>Still, Nevo's mind often drifts to the moment in Gaza when Palestinian militants detonated explosives in a home, wounding him and killing two close friends in his army unit. He often thinks: Could the unit have acted differently so they'd be alive today?</p> <p>"You always think about them," Nevo said. "We think about what we did wrong, what we did right ... and we learn from it. But I cannot go back."</p> <p>Like many soldiers who have served in Gaza, he now has a large tattoo on his arm with the date of his injury — another permanent reminder on his body of the moment that changed his life.</p> <p>He is one of the many young soldiers carrying scars, some invisible, for the rest of their lives.</p>

                <div class="article-title">Prone to winter depression? Starting light therapy now can help</div>
                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
                <html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">

<p>Have you noticed you're sleeping a little longer? Maybe you're experiencing a shift in appetite — craving more sweets or pasta. In autumn, our bodies sense the change in light as the dark winter months approach, which can help explain what you are feeling.</p> <p>As daylight diminishes, you may find your mood dimming, too. About 1 in 20 adults have Seasonal Affective Disorder — which is seasonal depression. And millions more experience a milder form of "winter blues."</p> <p>One way to fend it off is by using a light box, beginning in the fall.</p>
<p>"A lot of research has shown that using bright light therapy in the morning can be extremely helpful to reverse some of the symptoms of seasonal depression," says Dr. Dorothy Sit, a psychiatrist and Associate Professor at Northwestern University, who has studied bright light therapy.</p> <p>Typically, people sit in front of a light box, which emits bright light, every morning, for about 30 minutes, give or take. Sit says making it part of a morning routine is key. "If people use a light box every day they can experience an enduring effect throughout the fall and winter," she says.</p> <p>Sit points to an often-cited study that found light therapy is on par with standard anti-depression medications in relieving symptoms. Some people do both, taking medication and using a light box, and research shows the combination can be helpful. Studies point to improvements in symptoms within one week of starting light therapy.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Understanding our body clocks</h3> <p>Our bodies can be quite sensitive to changes in daylight because we rely on it to regulate our circadian rhythms and our sleep-wake patterns.</p>
<p>And because our internal body clocks don't keep a perfect 24-hour cycle, the master clock in our brains needs a daily reset. "Light through the eyes," is the cue for the reset, explains Michael Terman, a retired professor of clinical psychology and psychiatry at Columbia University.</p> <p>That's why exposure to morning light is so important. "What we are doing is resetting that drifting circadian clock to synchronize with the outdoor world," Terman explains.</p> <p>Terman is also President of the non-profit organization, Center for Environmental Therapeutics, which aims to educate healthcare professionals and the public about therapies to improve mood and health, focusing on non-medication treatments, including light boxes.</p>
<p>Terman says some models of light boxes sold online are either too small or don't emit enough bright light. His organization offers guidance on how to select a light box, and recommends purchasing models that meet the standards of devices tested in clinical trials.</p> <p><strong>A few things to keep in mind when starting use of a light box: </strong></p> <ol class="edTag rte2-style-ol"><li>Purchase a light box that emits 10,000 lux of light. (Lux is a measure of brightness.) </li><li>Larger screens are better, according to the Center for Environmental Therapeutics, because screen size influences light exposure."Smaller sizes increase the likelihood that small head movements reduce the 10,000 lux dose," the group says. </li><li>Adjust the angle of the light box. The light box should project downwards towards the eyes at an angle. This will help avoid a glare.</li><li>Start with 30 minutes in front of the light box and make adjustments based on how you feel. If you only get a little spurt of additional energy, you may want to increase to 45 minutes. Or if you feel jittery, that may be too much.  "Just as with a drug, light has to be dosed," Terman says. </li></ol>
<p>"I think bright light is still an underrecognized treatment option," says psychiatrist Dorothy Sit. And you don't need to be clinically depressed to benefit. Light therapy can be quite helpful for people who even have "milder forms," she says.</p> <p>So, If you're one of the many people who feels a dip in mood and energy beginning in fall, you may want to consider a light box, Sit says. But she also recommends that you talk to a healthcare provider about symptoms and treatment options.</p> <p>Also, keep in mind that a lack of light is not the only trigger of a low mood. If it's cold and snowy, people tend to go out less, says Dr. Jamie Zeitzer of Stanford University. "That can be depressing." He says light therapy won't help with the blues caused by social isolation, so remember to reach out to friends and stay engaged in activities that bring you into contact with others.</p>
<p>When it comes to feeling good in the coming darker months, we need light, as well as a handful  of habits that can help boost our moods, including laughter, friendship, a healthy diet, physical activity and exercise.<br/></p>

                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>

<p>For Emily Hess, it was a Phidippus regius named Gretel. Hayden Shea's first was caught by her boyfriend's dad. Sunday Costell ordered her first one off eBay.</p> <p>Those spiders were the gateway bugs into the booming community of jumping spider pet owners. And thanks to social media videos of their head-tilting, leg waggling antics, these web-slingers are in high demand.</p> <p>"I went from selling three to four a week to thousands a week," said Costell, owner of Sundays Spiders outside Portland, Ore, who now has tens of thousands of "web puppies" in her shop.</p> <p>These could-be pests have made the leap to hugely popular pets, particularly with women, sellers say, noting some women get interested as they try to overcome their fear of spiders, while others are simply enchanted by their unexpected cuteness. As a result, breeders are being flooded with requests online as videos rack up millions of views.</p> 
<p>"There's a lot of demand. I don't even post mine anymore. I just wait. I just go based on the DMs on my Instagram," said Shea, a breeder in St. Cloud, Fla.</p>
<p>There are thousands of different types of jumping spiders in the world, with 300 in the U.S. alone, according to the Bohart Museum of Entomology. They can jump up to a height of 40 times their body size, which is usually smaller than a penny.</p> <p>Phidippus regius, commonly known as the regal jumping spider, is the largest type found in North America. They live in trees, which means they usually hang out at the top of their enclosures. And if you lose one in the house, you should look up.</p> <p>The spiders come in a variety of colors, peachy oranges, inky blacks and white (which has been in high demand lately because they are rarer). And they shed their exoskeletons.</p> <p>"They could change drastically over their molts," said breeder Shea. "It's really interesting. Like I've had some that are white and they go completely dark."</p> 
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>From fear to favor</strong></h3> <p>Paradoxically, many jumping spider owners were terrified of spiders to begin with. That was the case for Hess, who has built a following of 1.6 million on TikTok showing off her brood of "spoods" (as the internet has affectionately nicknamed the spiders).</p> <p>"I live in Iowa. There's spiders everywhere. And I was afraid of them my whole life," said Hess. "And it was making things really inconvenient, because I couldn't go into a room if I knew there was a spider in there."</p>
<p>Hess, 40, started looking at spider pics to tame her fear. Then she learned that people kept them as pets.</p> <p>"I got my first jumping spider and just fell in love with her and really bonded and it just kind of changed how I felt about them in general. And it worked. I'm not afraid of spiders anymore," she said.</p> 
<p>Arizona breeder Heather Mulligan had her first jumping spiders for two weeks before she built up the courage to handle them.</p> <p>"I told my husband I was going to get a jumping spider. He said, 'You're not. You're scared of spiders!'" said Mulligan, owner of Jumping Jewels AZ in Surprise, Ariz. "I was like, 'Yeah, but these ones are so cute.' So he went out of town for work and I got two."</p> <p>Now, Mulligan has a thousand of them that she breeds for sale – from pinprick-sized babies to big mamma spiders spinning egg sacks.</p> <p>And she has a lot in common with her customers.</p> <p>"Like 95% of my customers are female and they do not have the support of their partner," she laughed.</p> <p>Hess, who posts under the handle @mini_robomuppets, owns about a dozen jumping spiders, and each has a distinct personality.</p> <p>"There are some that are super outgoing and some that are really high energy, some that are just really relaxed," she said.</p> <p>Once people overcome the fear, "they fall in love with their little personalities," said Costell, the Pacific Northwest breeder.</p> <p>And that change in perspective can lead to different attitudes toward creepy crawlies, the breeders said.</p> <p>"Time and time again I get comments on social media from people that were arachnophobes and that killed every bug that they came across," said Andrea Traid, owner of Little Spoods. "After learning about jumping spiders (even when not inclined to keeping them), it made them have a different perspective about spiders and bugs and instead of smooshing them, now they grab a cup and put them outside."</p> 
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>The amazing spider</strong></h3> <p>Jumping spiders are smarter than you think.</p>
<p>They don't build capture webs, but pounce on their prey, said the University of Cincinnati's Nathan Morehouse, whose lab studies jumping spiders. To hunt, they have to interact with their surroundings.</p> <p>"These animals are working with a brain about the size of a poppy seed. So it's tiny. And the complexity of their behavior is surprising given how small their brains are," he said.</p> <p>They can have stellar eyesight, can make plans and even have a sense of the difference between one, two and three things.</p> <p>"They really do act like little cats in a certain way as they stalk things and play with things and move around," said Morehouse.</p> 
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>But how does it work?</strong></h3> <p>They're popular, but far from a common household pet. Here are answers to some questions you might have about owning a jumping spider.</p> <p><strong>Are they hard to take care of? </strong>"They're a step up from a pet rock," said Mulligan. They require tiny enclosures – smaller than a shoe box – water and food (more on that below).</p> <p><strong>How much do they cost? </strong>A single spider can range from $30 up to around $100. There are many breeders online who can ship them. And PetSmart recently listed them for sale on its website, although the company did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p><strong>What do they eat? </strong>This could be the dealbreaker for many people. Spiders need live prey like tiny mealworms, cockroaches and fruit flies. Emphasis on the word <em>live.</em> Because of the way they consume the bugs, they can't be dried out. "They make their prey smoothie, basically, and then drink the inside. So you can't feed them anything like dried worms," said Mulligan.</p> <p><strong>Will they get lost? </strong>Breeders say they're about as likely to get lost as a hamster, maybe even less so. If you're handling them, they lay down anchor webs to your hands, so even if they leap away, they're still tethered.</p>
<p><strong>Do they bite?</strong> Yes, but not unless provoked. The spiders tend to bite people who stick their hands inside their enclosure, spooking the "spoods," according to breeders. "I've handled hundreds and hundreds of them at this point. I've never been bitten once," said Traid. And if you are bitten, it feels about the same as a bee sting.</p> <p><strong>How long do they live?</strong> About one to two years, although some breeders say they have spiders that have made it to their third birthday.</p> <p><strong>Can I pet them? </strong>Probably best not to, you might squish them. But if you're lucky, you can get a boop.</p>

<p>The top four leaders in Congress are scheduled to meet<strong> </strong>with President Trump this afternoon at the White House, just ahead of a September 30 deadline to fund the government and avoid a shutdown.</p> <p>The Oval Office meeting with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is set to occur ahead of an expected Senate vote on a short-term stopgap bill.</p> <p>House Republicans narrowly passed a continuing resolution earlier this month that would fund the government through November 21. That measure failed in the Senate because of Democratic opposition. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the chamber; they need 60 votes to pass the legislation.</p>
<p>"We are resolute in our determination to avoid a government shutdown and address the Republican healthcare crisis. Time is running out," said Jeffries and Schumer Saturday in a statement regarding the White House meeting.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A meeting redo</h3> <p>Monday's Oval Office meeting comes after President Trump abruptly canceled a planned meeting last week with the two Democratic leaders.</p> <p>"After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive," Trump posted on social media.</p> <p>Democrats are pushing to make permanent expanded tax cuts from the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year, and repeal cuts to healthcare programs that were put in place as part of the GOP's spending and tax bill bill passed earlier this summer.</p> <p>Republicans are pushing to fund the government first, and then negotiate on the subsidies.</p> <p>"[The expiry date] doesn't happen until the end of the year. We can have that conversation," said Thune Sunday on NBC's <em>Meet the Press. </em>"But before we do, release the hostage, set the American people free, keep the government open and let's have a conversation about those premium tax credits. I'm certainly open to that."</p>
<p>But top Democrats have repeatedly said a handshake agreement on a future negotiation about the subsidies isn't enough.</p> <p>"We need a serious negotiation," Schumer said in a separate appearance on Sunday's <em>Meet the Press. </em>"Now, if the president at this meeting is going to rant and just yell at Democrats and talk about all his alleged grievances and say this, that and the other thing, we won't get anything done. But my hope is it will be a serious negotiation."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Clock is ticking</h3> <p>Without Congressional action, government funding will expire at 12:01 am on<strong> </strong>Oct. 1.</p> <p>While critical services would continue, like Social Security and payments from Medicare and Medicaid, there could be delays in processing new applications for those programs.</p> <p>In a shutdown, anything deemed nonessential is put on hold, so Americans could experience delays in certain services and hundreds of thousands of federal workers will go without pay.</p> <p>In a move to seemingly raise the stakes, the White House's budget arm instructed federal agencies to prepare to lay off workers permanently, instead of the traditional temporary furlough.</p> <p>Congressional Democrats panned the memo as an intimidation tactic.</p> <p>"This is nothing less than mafia-style blackmail," Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told NPR. "Essentially, the president is threatening to fire dedicated federal employees who have nothing to do with the ongoing political and policy dispute."</p> <p>If the administration makes good on its threat, it could mean that whenever the federal government does reopen, it would have a smaller workforce.<br/></p>

<p><em>This story is part of the My Unsung Hero series, from the Hidden Brain team. It features stories of people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone else.</em></p> <p>When Tanya Eby was in sixth grade, her friends made a decision that stunned and devastated her.</p> <p>"The girls that I hung out with for lunch and played with had held a meeting and told me that I was no longer cool enough to hang out with them," Eby recalled.</p> <p>"They would be ignoring me, and I was no longer part of the group."</p>
<p>Eby's world was unraveling — but the loss of her friends was only part of the story. A few days later, she broke down in tears while in class, and her teacher, Mrs. Welch, pulled her into the teachers' lounge to find out what was wrong.</p> <p>"And I told her about the girls. But then I told her the rest of the story," Eby said.</p> <p>"And the rest of the story was, a few months prior to this happening, my mom and my stepdad decided my big brother — my anchor in life — needed to go live with my dad. So, overnight they took him and they dropped him off with my dad. So I woke up one morning and my brother was gone."</p>
<p>Not long after, her stepdad left too. So, when the girls at school decided they weren't going to be friends with her anymore, it was just the latest example of the people she cared about leaving without warning.</p> <p>"It felt like everywhere I turned, people I loved disappeared," Eby said. "They stopped loving me and they didn't tell me why and I had no control over it."</p> <p>Eby cried as she told the whole story to Welch.</p> <p>"And in a moment that I'll remember forever, she just said, 'Oh, honey,'" Eby recalled. "She pulled me close to her and she hugged me. That's it. She hugged me and she let me cry. And somehow her hug centered me. It rooted me and it made me feel that I would be OK."</p> 
<p>School ended and a few years later, Eby reconnected with her brother. She never saw Welch again. But Eby said that around 2002, when she began to teach writing to college students, she realized that her teacher's small act of caring had left a lasting mark.</p>
<p>"It helped me have empathy for students and understand that there were likely many things they were working through," she said.</p> <p>"And even if you don't understand the reason for their pain or maybe it seems superficial — like girls breaking up with you — there are sometimes deeper things happening that you don't understand," Eby said. "Just simply being seen, being listened to, is enough."</p> <p>Eby still returns to Welch's quiet gesture, more than 40 years after that day in sixth grade.</p> <p> "That one moment ... affected my whole life and I think it's had an effect on others' lives, too," Eby said.</p> <p>"Kindness isn't always just these big acts, but very tiny moments of connection that can change someone completely.  So my deepest thanks to Mrs. Welch."</p> <p><em>My Unsung Hero is also a podcast</em><em> — new episodes are released every Tuesday.

                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
                <html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">

<p>In the early 1950s, British physician Philip Hugh-Jones was flummoxed by 13 patients who showed up at the diabetes clinic he ran near Kingston, Jamaica.</p> <p>At the time, researchers broadly recognized two kinds of diabetes, known today as Type 1 and Type 2. Hugh-Jones himself coined those terms in a study of hundreds of patients published in 1955.</p> <p>Most of his patients fell into those two buckets, but that group of 13 people didn't fit into either category, says Michael Boyne, an endocrinologist at the University of the West Indies, where Hugh-Jones did his research.</p> <p>"They were relatively young, thin and kind of undernourished looking," says Boyne.</p>
<p>Normally, that would point to Type 1 diabetes, where individuals are unable to make their own insulin and can become underweight. </p> <p>But these 13 patients never experienced a common symptom of Type 1  — ketoacidosis. That occurs when the body runs out of insulin and starts burning fat for fuel, which can lead the blood to become dangerously acidic.</p> <p>"Even though they were thin, they never developed keto[acidosis]," says Boyne, seemingly ruling out Type 1 diabetes. But they didn't seem to be Type 2 diabetics either, who tend to be overweight.</p> <p>"So he said, 'Huh, these guys are different. They don't fit Type 1 or 2,'" says Boyne. "So he called them Type J." That's "J" for Jamaica. </p> <p>The name didn't stick. Subsequent names didn't stick either, despite cases of this unusual form of diabetes continuing to surface, especially in areas afflicted with malnutrition. Now, 70 years later, an international team of researchers is trying to formalize a new name — Type 5 diabetes.</p> <p>"The time is ripe" to recognize this disease that could impact as many as 25 million people," says Dr. Meredith Hawkins, a diabetes researcher at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.</p> <p>In April, the International Diabetes Federation adopted the new name. Now, in a perspective published in <em>The</em> <em>Lancet Global Health</em>, Hawkins and an international team of researchers are urging other entities, including the World Health Organization, to get on board too.</p>
<p>"It is important, from a scientific perspective, to give it a name," says Nihal Thomas, an endocrinologist at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, India, who is part of the effort. "And patients will benefit a lot," he said, since some are getting treatment that can be deadly.</p> <h3 class="edTag">The dangers of not having a name</h3> <p>After Hugh-Jones published his 1955 paper, researchers around the globe started noticing similar cases that didn't fit Type 1 or Type 2.</p> <p>"It had a variety of names over time, but they were all generally describing the same thing," says Boyne. "And in Southeast Asia, India and Africa, they really noticed a strong connection with malnutrition in early life."</p> <p>Hawkins herself first saw this unusual form of diabetes while working in Uganda in the early 2000s.</p> <p>"A lot of very impoverished patients that were coming in from rural areas, very thin and malnourished, very high blood sugars," she says. They'd exhibit classic symptoms of diabetes, including frequent urination, excessive thirst or hunger, and even nerve damage.</p> <p>To most clinicians, including Hawkins at the time, such patients seem like classic Type 1 cases. The standard treatment would be to send them home with a lot of insulin. But she and her colleagues soon learned that this approach could be lethal.</p> <p>"Basically, in many cases, committing them to a death sentence from low blood sugar," if they didn't have enough food to eat at home, she says. Insulin is a hormone that helps shuttle sugar from the blood into cells, where it can be used for energy. Too much insulin, coupled with too little food, can result in dangerously low blood sugar, she says.</p> <p>Seeing such cases of "young people who had died from low blood sugar because they weren't being appropriately treated really motivated our research," says Hawkins.</p> <h3 class="edTag">What makes Type 5 diabetes different</h3> <p>Since then, she and other researchers have learned that physiologically, people with Type 5 diabetes look different from those with Type 1 or 2. Those differences seem to be shaped by malnutrition.</p>
<p>"These individuals have generally had malnutrition from the time they were in utero," says Hawkins. "They're malnourished as toddlers, as children, as adolescents and as adults. These are the ones that don't catch up. They just stay very thin, and that makes them different than other forms of diabetes."</p> <p>One key difference is the pancreas, where insulin gets produced. Evidence suggests that malnutrition in early development harms the ability of the pancreas to pump out insulin.</p> <p>"Their pancreas is crap," says Boyne. "It's not as bad as Type 1, but it's really crappy."</p> <p>That leaves people with Type 5 diabetes in a weird spot. They can produce some insulin and their cells respond to it (unlike people with Type 2 diabetes, whose cells are often resistant to insulin), but they can't make quite enough to normally regulate their blood sugar.</p> <p>"We felt very strongly that if this was a separate entity, it needed separate treatment," says Hawkins. Figuring out the best treatment will take more research, she says, something she hopes the new name can galvanize.</p> <p>Not everyone in the diabetes research community is convinced that Type 5 diabetes is a distinct entity or that it deserves a new name.</p> <p>"Formal classification risks codifying what may be a spectrum of poorly characterized Type 2 diabetes rather than a discrete entity," says Anoop Misra, an endocrinologist at the Centre of Nutrition &amp; Metabolic Research in New Delhi. He says the existing data isn't enough to definitively establish a distinct form of diabetes.</p> <p>The International Diabetes Federation disagrees, though, and launched a working group aimed at developing better diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines for Type 5 diabetes. (It chose the name Type 5 as uncontested territory, since there are ongoing efforts to label other forms of diabetes as Types 3 and 4.) Advocates hope recognition by other health authorities, including the World Health Organization, could help that effort, at a time when cases are poised to rise in some parts of the globe.</p>
<p>Food crises in Gaza, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Yemen could be setting up a generation for increased risk of Type 5 diabetes, says Boyne.</p> <p>"It's really heart-rending," he says. "This is something that's preventable — it's preventable by food."</p>

<p>Puerto Rican rapper and singer Bad Bunny will headline next year's Super Bowl halftime show.</p> <p>The National Football League, Apple Music and Roc Nation made the announcement during halftime of Sunday night's game between the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys.</p>
<p>"What I'm feeling goes beyond myself," Bad Bunny said in a statement released by the NFL. "It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL."</p> <p>Super Bowl 60 will be played next Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, Calif.</p> <p>The Super Bowl announcement follows the three-time Grammy winner's residency in Puerto Rico attended by half a million fans and just before he's scheduled to host this upcoming weekend's season premiere of <em>Saturday Night Live</em>.</p>
<p>Born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, the 31-year-old superstar said in an interview earlier in September that he chose not to do any concert dates in the 50 U.S. states during his current world tour. He made that decision, he said, because he was afraid ICE immigration agents would show up at his concert venues.</p>

<p>Police say they are investigating the death of a stowaway found Sunday morning inside the landing gear compartment of an American Airlines flight that had recently arrived in Charlotte, N.C., from Europe.</p> <p>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police said maintenance staff discovered the body shortly after 9 a.m. Sunday while servicing the aircraft. Officers from CMPD's Airport Division pronounced the individual dead at the scene. Homicide detectives and crime scene teams responded, and the Mecklenburg County Medical Examiner's Office will conduct an autopsy.</p>
<p>In a brief statement, a spokesperson for American Airlines confirmed the discovery to NPR, adding the airline was "working with law enforcement on its investigation."</p> <p>There were no immediate details about the stowaway's identity, how they entered the plane, or from what city in Europe the flight originated.</p> <p>Cases of stowaways hiding in wheel wells are rare but not unprecedented — and survival is rarer still.</p> <p>Last week, a 13-year-old boy miraculously survived a 90-minute Kam Air flight from Kabul to Delhi, after he slipped into the plane's landing gear compartment. The boy, who was repatriated back to Afghanistan, told local authorities he had wandered into the compartment out of curiosity.</p> <p>Other incidents have ended in tragedy. In January, two bodies were found in the landing gear of a JetBlue aircraft that had landed in Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>Experts say freezing temperatures, extreme wind chill and a lack of oxygen make survival during long flights in wheel wells highly unlikely.</p> <p>The Charlotte case remains under investigation. Anyone with information is asked to call the CMPD Homicide Unit at 704-432-8477 or leave an anonymous tip through Charlotte Crime Stoppers.</p>
