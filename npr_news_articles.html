                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
                <html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">

<p>Ten years ago, professional tattoo artist Brian Finn decided to use his talents to help people — by providing free or reduced cost tattoos on his day off for people with scars caused by trauma</p> <p>"It just kind of hit me one day that I had the tools to do something to help people. So, I kind of rolled with it," Finn says.</p>
<p>NPR first spoke with Finn in 2015 when he started tattooing clients on his day off.</p> <p>After that interview, he says, the requests started pouring in. He's done thousands of tattoos for people wanting to cover up scars from domestic abuse, human trafficking, self-harm and more. Finn, who has been tattooing for more than 30 years, says tattoos carry different meanings for everyone.</p> <p>"Some people, you know, they want to cover up a scar with a tattoo so they can't see it. But there's a lot of people, too, that came in … they wanted to kind of highlight it," he says. "Everybody's different. And I think both are great ideas and just a different approach depending on what you want to do."</p> 
<p>He says after our 2015 interview, the requests were not just coming from potential customers.</p>
<p>He offers advice to tattoo artists who want to offer a similar service. And he's found a community of like minded artists. "There's people that reached out from all across the world, different tattoo shops, different tattooers saying: 'Hey, I heard that on NPR. I'm kind of following suit and I'm doing the same thing.'"</p> <p>Finn says that the work hasn't always been easy. When he first started, he wasn't anticipating the emotional toll.</p> <p>"Emotionally, it was … there was a lot of pain to hear on a daily basis," he says, recounting working with people who have experienced trauma.</p> <p>"The only thing that's really changed is that I think it's less overwhelming … hearing everybody's story all at once was more than I expected."</p>
<p>Ten years on, Finn says he plans to keep going.</p> <p>"I don't see any reason to stop," he says.</p> <p>"It's nice to help people out."</p> <p><em>To tell us your own story about how being a volunteer has shaped your life or nominate someone you think we should profile, fill out </em><em>this form</em><em>.</em></p>

                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
                <html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">

<p>There's something for everyone at a state fair — petting zoos, live music, fried foods.</p> <p>For many states in the U.S., summer to fall is the season for the annual state fair. The country's first state fair dates to the 19th century, when locals would showcase livestock, crafts and agriculture.</p> <p>State fairs of today share the same elements, but have evolved into something like pop-up theme parks. They remain a favorite American pastime, contributing $30 billion to the U.S. economy each year, said David Grindle, CEO of the International Association of Fairs &amp; Expositions.</p> <p>Here's a look at how state fairs began, and what keeps them going year after year.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">The state fair's agricultural roots remain</h3> <p>State fairs began as agricultural competitions, which the British brought with them as they colonized North America, said Nick Pirro, who the New York State Fair has deemed its unofficial resident historian. (He's officially their graphic designer and website manager.) They served as spaces where farmers could show off their livestock and inform the public, according to the UK's House of Commons.</p>
<p>Once the colonies began developing governments and counties, county fairs took off. Then those counties grew into states, and people eventually developed an appetite for something more grandiose, Pirro said.</p> <p>Thus, in 1841, the state fair was born. The first one was held in Syracuse, N.Y. There were plowing competitions and animal exhibits — not far off from what you would see at a fair today. Other areas that weren't yet states followed New York, including what is now Minnesota and Iowa, Pirro said.</p> <p>"It grew because, as you got more and more county fairs, [it's] our natural desire as humans to show off and be competitive," Grindle said.</p> <p>Now, fair contestants show off all kinds of things — flowers, outfits and cakes — in play for those coveted ribbons. But agriculture is still everywhere at fairs. It's a common thread in the food and drinks offered, the jobs supported and the crops flaunted, Pirro said.</p>
<p>"The driving force is agriculture," Pirro said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Showcasing arts and crafts</h3> <p>Crafts have an early presence at state fairs, too. But back then, displays and demonstrations were a matter of function. They were useful for determining things like the types of wool a sheep might produce, or showing off the latest manufacturing or blacksmith techniques, said Mary Savig, the curator-in-charge of the Smithsonian's Renwick Gallery, an arm of the American Art Museum in Washington, D.C. One of the gallery's current exhibits is "State Fairs: Growing American Craft."</p>
<p>Demonstrations are still present. But today, the menagerie serves many purposes — educating, entertaining, and showcasing local artists, talent and trends.</p> <p>For example, in the 19th century, Victorian hair wreaths (made from human hair) were all the rage throughout the country, said Savig. She traveled to various state fairs to curate the Renwick exhibit. She said more recently, "diamond" art has become popular, in which people make portraits, or recreate famous artworks out of crystals.</p> <p>And as a tongue-in-cheek homage to fair food, some crafters have begun constructing quilts-on-a-stick at the Minnesota State Fair, for example. They're mini quilts about the size of a sheet of printer paper that artists poke skewers through.</p> <p>"It's a pretty small project and it's very accessible to people, especially new quilters," Savig said.</p> <p>In Mississippi, the Choctaw Indian Princess is crowned each year at the Choctaw Indian Fair, in which the contestants often make their own garments with elaborate beading and embroidery work. In Minnesota, there are contests for rosemaling, a Norwegian folk art, which is characterized by intricate patterns of flowers and swirls.</p> <p>Some of these works have made their way to the nation's capital for the Renwick Gallery's exhibit, which runs through next year. The works include a cow made out of 700 pounds of butter, which will sit in a custom, 38 degrees Fahrenheit case.</p> 
<p>"On artists, [fairs] have had historically, a really important impact, just as far as validating an artist's skills, also giving them a platform to show their work and be recognized," Savig said. "I think it's encouraged a lot of artists to continue their work in various ways."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Fried foods and music stars came later</h3> <p>Food and entertainment has certainly taken off, as neither were common at early fairs. There was no electricity back then.</p> <p>"Once the fair ended for the day, it's like, 'What are these people going to do?' So they had to occupy themselves," Pirro said.</p>
<p>That usually meant going to taverns and bars, and enduring long travel days by horse and buggy. New York fairgoers eventually grew tired of this, Pirro said. So the Ka-Noo-No Karnival debuted in Syracuse in 1905 – alongside the state fair – as a way to keep people in town. It was a parade that had string lights lining the floats' path, allowing attendees to get a peek at the new wonders of electricity, Pirro said.</p>
<p>Now? "We can keep the lights on…and keep them well-fed with anything and everything that you can deep fry nowadays," he said.</p> <p>There are fried Oreos, Snickers and pickles. French fries and funnel cakes. The largest bagel Guinness World Records has on file (868 pounds) was shown at the New York State Fair in 2004. You can also get turkey legs the size of your forearm — plenty to chow down on while taking in crowd-favorites, from pigs racing, to future megastars like Taylor Swift, who first performed at the New York State Fair in 2007.</p> <p>The beauty of the state fair, Grindle says, is that no two are alike.</p> <p>"If you've been to one fair, you've been to one," Grindle said. "They are all so beautifully unique. They are so reflective of the things going on in their communities that I really encourage people to get out and explore them to see what's going on and ask questions."<br/></p>

                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>

<p>NPR asked a federal judge to block the Corporation for Public Broadcasting from awarding a $57.9 million grant to a new consortium of public media institutions to operate the satellite that connects the public radio system for the next five years.</p>
<p>NPR's submission, filed Friday afternoon, gives insight into the behind-the-scenes tensions within public media this year as Congressional Republicans successfully moved, at President Trump's insistence, to strip public broadcasting of all funding they had already approved for the next two years.</p> <p>NPR has run the satellite-based system for more than four decades. It enables hundreds of public radio stations and other outside producers to air and share programming, including many shows and stations with no affiliation with NPR itself. CPB is the Congressionally funded private corporation through which federal money is funneled to public radio and TV stations, PBS and, to a lesser extent, NPR.</p>
<p>The money at issue is not part of the money NPR receives toward its own annual operations, which has typically represented 1% to 2% of its operating budget. PBS and its member stations have, on average, received 15% of their budgets from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting; for public radio stations, that figure has been roughly 10%, though the figure has varied widely.</p> <p>That subsidy for all public media evaporates starting Wednesday with the new federal fiscal year.</p> <p>The federal funding for the public radio satellite distribution system is calculated separately from the money set aside for NPR and its member stations.</p>
<p>According to NPR's court submissions, NPR had been told by CPB in early April that it would soon receive more than $30 million to cover the next three years for running the service, plus the balance on the current year. CPB then swiftly reversed course, with an executive citing a decision at the CPB board level saying NPR could not be involved, the court filing alleges.</p> <p>Earlier Friday, CPB had announced it was giving the contract to the new consortium, called Public Media Infrastructure. Its members include New York Public Radio, PRX, the Minnesota-based American Public Media, and Station Resource Group, a consulting firm. The National Federation of Community Broadcasters, an association of smaller stations that are not part of the NPR network, is also participating.</p>
<p>"By awarding this grant to PMI, CPB is placing trust in stations to drive the future of radio content distribution, ensuring that interconnection is not only reliable but also innovative, representative and sustainable," CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison said in a statement. "This decision reflects CPB's commitment to support the entire public media system, especially rural and community stations, and to prepare the system for the future."</p> <p>NPR and three of its Colorado member stations are already suing the White House over Trump's May order banning CPB from spending any federal money on NPR, saying it is a violation of its Constitutional protections. Trump has called NPR and PBS "monsters" and accused them of bias. NPR says that demonstrates an unlawful retaliation for its exercise of free speech.</p>
<p>"We seek a clear judgment that finds the illegality and unconstitutionality of this executive order, and, in doing so, establishes definitively that public media enjoys the same protections from viewpoint discrimination as any other entity of the free press," NPR Chief Executive Katherine Maher wrote to member station officials Friday evening.</p> <p>"We enter into this motion with great reluctance," she continued. "This decision has undercut the bonds between our two organizations forged over many decades of service to the American people, and stands as a regretful coda to CPB's prior history of support for the First Amendment."</p> <p>In the motion Friday for a temporary restraining order, its executives attest to their shock at learning of the CPB's decision, saying it reflects the corporation bending to the Trump administration's will.</p> <p>"CPB is now poised to do the Order's bidding, in contravention of both the First Amendment and the express mandates of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967," states NPR's legal team, led by Miguel A. Estrada and Theodore J. Boutros, Jr.</p> <p>While CPB, NPR and PBS maintained a seemingly united front during an intensely pitched campaign to hold off the elimination of taxpayer subsidies, privately executives for CPB and PBS distanced themselves from NPR and Maher.</p>
<p>Three people with knowledge of events say CPB and PBS officials told some lawmakers they would be content if subsidies could be preserved for public media, especially the stations, even if NPR were not to receive further federal funding. They spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying they did not have authorization to speak publicly on the highly politically charged matter.</p> <p>Trump has publicly attacked NPR and PBS but it is the radio network that has drawn greater scrutiny for ideological bias, sparked in part by an accusatory essay in 2024 from a senior business editor who later left the network.</p> <p>During House hearings in late March, Republicans cast a severe light on Maher's years-old social media posts prior to her joining NPR early last year that reflected a liberal sensibility and support for Joe Biden's 2020 presidential bid.</p> <p>On April 2, according to statements from NPR executives filed along with its legal petition, a top CPB executive, Kathy Merritt, affirmed that the corporation had approved NPR's contract extension. The CPB agreed to transfer more than $35 million to fulfill the rest of the current contract and the new one, court papers say.</p>
<p>On April 14, the same day published reports reflected Trump's renewed effort to shear away all federal taxpayer subsidies for public media, CPB's Merritt "called NPR's Chief Operating Officer to inform him that CPB now wanted to provide PRSS funding to a separate entity, with the principal criterion for eligibility being that the entity lack any ties to NPR," according to the network's legal filings.</p> <p>Trump issued his formal rescission request to Congress on May 1. Shortly before the rescission vote in the summer, Trump publicly told Republicans in Congress that he would not campaign for anyone who failed to support the measure.</p> <p>Two weeks later, NPR announced a new initiative designed to provide what it called "best-in-class terrestrial distribution platform for live broadcast that is expected to transform how public radio stations receive programming across America." CPB continued to put the contract out for bidding nonetheless.</p>
<p>In the Friday court documents, NPR contends CPB's move to sever its contract to run the system "threatens NPR's contractual relationships with the Interconnected Stations and undermines the hard-earned trust that NPR has built with those stations over decades of service."</p> <p>NPR says without a restraining order, it will be unable to win back the contract in court, as CPB will be all but extinct. A skeleton crew will continue on to wind down CPB's operations.</p> <p>Through its chief spokesperson, CPB said late Friday it was "confident that our actions serve the best interests of the future of public radio."</p> <p>"We are disappointed that, at a time of tremendous challenge for all public media with substantially diminished resources, NPR is forcing CPB to expend scarce funds that would otherwise support the public media system in defending a lawsuit that has no merits and ultimately does not benefit the system," CPB stated.</p>
<p>In her note to station officials, Maher said that NPR's paramount concern involved "the integrity and stability of the public radio system." Maher said she had promised the new Public Media Infrastructure coalition that NPR would work with it to ensure that the system remained "vital and robust."</p> <p>The federal judge overseeing the case, Randolph D. Moss, has ordered a hearing on NPR's motion for Tuesday morning - the day before the federal funding of public media goes away.</p> <p><em>Disclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik.

                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
                <html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">

<p>The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the way for the Trump administration to continue to withhold over $4 billion in foreign aid already approved by Congress.</p> <p>Earlier this month, a federal judge in Washington, D.C. ordered the administration to release billions in foreign aid funds by the end of September — which the administration later appealed.</p> <p>On Friday, the justices voted 6-3 along ideological lines to allow the administration to freeze the foreign aid funds. The court's conservatives said Trump's foreign policy authority outweighed the harms claimed by the international aid groups suing and suggested that the groups may not have the standing to sue.</p>
<p>In the dissent, Justice Elena Kagan took issue with the way the ruling was reached, which was through the emergency docket.</p> <p>"We have had to consider this application on a short fuse — less than three weeks. We have done so with scant briefing, no oral argument, and no opportunity to deliberate in conference," Kagan wrote. </p> <p>Last month, President Trump informed House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., that he will not be spending $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid through a controversial and rare authority known as a pocket rescission.</p>
<p>Typically, lawmakers have 45 days to consider a request to rescind or cancel appropriated funds. But when a request comes close to the end of a budget year, the president may bypass the legislative branch. A pocket rescission has not been used since the 1970s.</p> <p>The pocket rescission includes targeting funds for development assistance grants, the United Nations, and international peacekeeping operations</p>

                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
                <html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">

<p>Assata Shakur, a Black liberation activist who was given political asylum in Cuba after her 1979 escape from a U.S. prison where she had been serving a life sentence for killing a police officer, has died, her daughter and the Cuban government said.</p>
<p>Shakur, who was born Joanne Deborah Chesimard, died Thursday in the capital city of Havana due to "health conditions and advanced age," Cuba's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. Shakur's daughter, Kakuya Shakur, confirmed her mother's death in a Facebook post.</p> <p>Officials in New Jersey, where Shakur had been arrested, convicted and imprisoned, said she was 78.</p> <p>A member of Black Panther Party and Black Liberation Army, Shakur's case had long been emblematic of the fraught relations between the U.S. and Cuba. American authorities, including President Trump during his first term, demanded her return from the communist nation for decades.</p>
<p>The FBI put Shakur on its list of " most wanted terrorists," but, in her telling — and in the minds of her supporters — she was pursued for crimes she didn't commit or that were justified.</p> <p>On May 2, 1973, Shakur and two others were pulled over by New Jersey State Police troopers because the car they were driving had a broken taillight.</p>
<p>A gunfight ensued and one of the troopers, Werner Foerster, was killed and another was wounded. One of Shakur's companions was also killed.</p> <p>The New York City native fled but was eventually apprehended. She was found guilty of murder, armed robbery and other crimes in 1977 and was sentenced to life in prison. Shakur was charged with additional bank robberies and in the nonfatal shootings of two other police officers, but most of those charges were dismissed or resulted in her acquittal.</p> <p>Shakur's prison stint was short-lived, though. In November 1979, members of the Black Liberation Army, posing as visitors, stormed the Clinton Correctional Facility for women, took two guards hostage and commandeered a prison van to break her out.</p> <p>Shakur disappeared before eventually emerging in 1984 in Cuba, where Fidel Castro granted her asylum.</p> <p>Offering Shakur safe harbor was one of the most famous examples of Cuba aligning itself with what it describes as revolutionary forces struggling against the oppressive capitalist empire to the north.</p>
<p>Much like Cuba supported anti-colonial and left-wing forces in Africa, Central and South America, the Cuban government saw the armed Black liberation movement in the U.S. as part of a global revolutionary struggle.</p> <p>New Jersey State Assemblyman Michael Inganamort, who sponsored a resolution last year calling on Cuba to extradite Shakur, lamented Friday that "justice was never served" in Foerster's death, while the labor union representing New Jersey officers dismissed Shakur "for her crime and cowardice."</p> <p>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and State Police Superintendent Patrick Callahan said they would "vigorously oppose" any attempt to repatriate Shakur's remains to the U.S.</p> <p>"Sadly, it appears she has passed without being held fully accountable for her heinous crimes," they said in a joint statement. "Unlike his killer, Trooper Foerster never had a chance to live out his days in peace."</p> <p>Sundiata Acoli, who was also convicted in Foerster's killing, was granted parole in 2022 after being imprisoned for nearly three decades.</p> <p>In her writings over the years, Shakur has maintained she didn't shoot anyone and had her hands in the air when she was wounded during the gunfire.</p> <p>More recently, her writings became a rallying cry during the Black Lives Matter movement, though opponents criticized her words as being influenced by Marxist and communist ideology.</p> <p>"It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win," Shakur wrote in <em>Assata: An Autobiography,</em> originally published in 1988. "We must love each other and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains."</p> <p>Black Lives Matter Grassroots Inc., a collective of racial justice activists from around the U.S., vowed to "fight in her honor and memory."</p>
<p>Malkia Amala Cyril, an early organizer of the BLM movement, expressed sorrow because Shakur died during a time of rising authoritarianism.</p> <p>"The world in this era needs the kind of courage and radical love she practiced if we are going to survive it," said Cyril, whose late mother had been part of the Black Panthers in New York alongside Shakur.</p> <p>Shakur's influence extended into the music world. She was famously close to the family of late rapper Tupac Shakur, who had considered her a godmother.</p>
<p>Public Enemy, the political hip-hop group and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees, are thought to be the first major artists to reference Shakur. The 1988 song <em>Rebel Without a Pause,</em> from the album <em>It Takes A Nation,</em> includes the lyrics "supporter of Chesimard," referring to her legal name.</p> <p>Rapper Common told Shakur's story in his 2000 song <em>A Song for Assata.</em> The Grammy award-winner's invitation to a White House poetry event in 2011, during the Obama administration, drew outrage from conservatives and law enforcement groups who felt it was disrespectful to Foerster's family and police officers broadly.</p>

<p>Starting Monday, an influx of federal agents will be deployed across Memphis as part of a broader push in what President Trump has described as a crackdown on crime.</p> <p>At a news conference on Friday, Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said personnel from 13 U.S. agencies will arrive in the city next week. That will include agents from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The operation will also include 300 troopers from the Tennessee Highway Patrol.</p>
<p>It remains unclear exactly how many members of the National Guard will be deployed, but the governor said troops will be in support roles and not tasked with making arrests. He added that the Guard will not be armed unless it is requested by local law enforcement.</p> <p>Lee said the operation is set to occur in phases over the "next weeks and months." The governor said "planning has been underway for months" about bringing in federal resources to curb crime, calling it a "generational opportunity."</p> <p>" The story of crime in Memphis is about to be a story of the past," he added.</p> <p>Memphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, said Friday that he recognizes that community members have many questions and strong feelings — both for and against — the upcoming federal partnership.</p> <p>"As the leader of our city, my goal is to make sure that as resources come into our community we find ways to use them effectively and for the benefit of the residents of our great city," he said.</p> <p>Young noted that Memphis has made progress in reducing crime, and specifically violent crime, after a spike in 2023. The city is already participating in several joint state and federal task forces, including with the FBI, U.S. Marshals and ICE.</p>
<p>The city government launched a website to provide updates and information on the federal resources that will be coming in.</p>
<p>Trump has previously described Memphis as "suffering from tremendous levels of violent crime that have overwhelmed its local government's ability to respond effectively." Earlier this month, he signed a presidential memorandum to establish a federal task force to combat crime in the city, characterizing it as a "replica" of what he has done in Washington, D.C.</p> <p>The Trump administration has been accused of unfairly targeting Democratic-led cities. Federal troops were previously sent to Los Angeles and D.C., both of which are run by Democratic mayors, similar to Memphis. Trump has also voiced interest in sending troops to Chicago, New Orleans and St. Louis.</p>

                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>

<p>NEW YORK — It's the first United Nations General Assembly since President Donald Trump shook up the foreign aid landscape by cutting billions of dollars in assistance.</p> <p>"There's a lot of anxiety, apprehension. It's almost like everybody's waiting for the other shoe to drop," says Solomon Zewdu, the CEO of The END Fund, a group that focuses on eliminating neglected tropical diseases.</p> <p>He's one of thousands of people from all over the world who descended on Manhattan for a week of high-level meetings at the 80th session of the U.N. General Assembly.</p> <p>NPR reporters were on the ground in New York and spoke with global health leaders about their impressions of the week. Here's what they told us – edited for length and clarity.</p> 
<p><strong>Solomon Zewdu, the CEO of The END Fund</strong></p> <p>Dr. Solomon Zewdu is based in South Africa and he says the thing that struck him most this General Assembly is that global health leaders are "talking in silos."</p>
<p>"We're not hearing each other," he says. Some are having conversations about how dependent countries are on aid, while others are lamenting the cuts.</p> <p>"But now, what's the next step? Let's move on. There's urgency. Time kills people," he says.</p> <p>He's afraid "everybody's going to scatter, and then we might wait for the next summit to happen — and, in between, people dying, people's health is being compromised."</p> 
<p><strong>Varnee Murugan</strong><strong>, senior director of the Global Initiative on Health and the Economy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce</strong></p> <p>Murugan left the General Assembly enthused by the new U.S. global health strategy and its emphasis on bringing private-sector companies back into the global health arena.</p> <p>"In the past, the private sector has been seen as, in some cases, tangential, in other cases, as an opponent," she says.</p> <p>She argues for-profit businesses have a lot to offer. "There is the bottom line — and that's always going to exist — but there are also broader objectives."</p> <p>She says they have a lot of knowledge to contribute as well as the ability to "really help local economies grow and prosper and then transition away from aid and more towards sustainable trade."</p> 
<p><strong>Atul Satija, CEO of the </strong><strong>Nudge Institute</strong><strong> </strong></p> <p>Atul Satija lives in India, where he leads a non-profit organization that addresses poverty in his country. He says he senses a difference in the U.N. event this year.</p>
<p>"The quality of conversations is slightly deeper," says Satija. "It is a lot about the problems that we are facing globally, and how we can collectively solve them. So I am enjoying it because it's a lot more real."</p> <p>With people around the world losing health care and education opportunities because of the U.S. cuts, Staija says that "people are figuring out new ways to design solutions so that communities are not affected as much."</p> <p>But he is also troubled by what the future might hold: "What keeps me up at night is: Do we have the space and the quiet to do the work we want to do?"</p> <p><strong>Peter Sands, CEO of the Global Fund</strong></p> <p>Peter Sands says this year's General Assembly feels a bit like being on a "high wire."</p> <p>"This is, kinda, of moment of reckoning. On the negative side: There have been cuts in funding, disruptions to services. But on the positive side: We've got some extraordinarily exciting scientific innovations," he says. "There's a lot to lose, but there's also a lot to achieve."</p> <p>His mind is focused on the money bit of the equation. The Global Fund is busy trying to raise money for its next three year cycle. And, afterall, Sands is a former banker — he was the CEO of Standard Chartered PLC, one of the world's major international banks.</p> <p>"As somebody who spent a lot of my life doing return on investment, investing in global health is one of the highest return on investment things you can do," he says, pointing to the economic growth and health gains that come from fighting diseases.</p> <p><strong>Jackie Aldrette, executive director of </strong><strong>AVSI-USA</strong></p> <p>Jackie Aldrette hasn't been to a U.N. General Assembly in years. But this time, she felt it was important to attend.</p> <p>Her U.S.-based organization, which supports marginalized communities around the world, is one of many aid groups that lost funding because of the U.S. cuts.</p>
<p>"I came wanting to kind of gain more clarity about what we should focus on," says Aldrette.</p> <p>"I definitely felt a kind of this new energy," she says. "Like a fire underneath in terms of finding ways of working for the causes we care about, and the realization that it's better to do that together."</p> <p>Her favorite moment of the week? "I found myself in conversation with someone from a very well-established organization, with whom I was able to just share a kind of dream I've been cooking up and she got excited and shared with me her dream," she says. "And so, we were kind of dreaming together."</p> <p>She also had an epiphany about the U.S. aid cuts: "It feels like the U.S. doesn't have a seat at the table anymore," Aldrette says. "But there was also hope because it wasn't like the lack of U.S. presence meant the table collapsed. No, we were still at that table, so we can go on."<br/></p>

<p>President Trump campaigned on a promise to use the justice system to seek retribution against his perceived political enemies. Yesterday, the Justice Department indicted former FBI director James Comey on two criminal counts.</p> <p>The decision to bring a case against Comey is a turning point for the Department of Justice.</p> <p>NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson and Justice correspondent Carrie Johnson explain how Trump is following through on his campaign promise to punish his enemies. The rapid remaking of the justice system under his guidance is also feeding Trump's efforts to consolidate more power into the executive branch.</p>

<p>Every October, the U.S. observes LGBTQ+ History Month, which includes National Coming Out Day on Oct. 11. The day, celebrated since 1988, honors the significance of coming out or inviting others in and raises awareness about LGBTQ+ rights. Coming out is a personal choice and often an important part of reclaiming the right to live authentically in one's identity publicly. The Human Rights Campaign says "coming out" is a common term for acknowledging being LGBTQ+, but it is not about seeking permission to be who you are. To embrace and celebrate the courage of people who have come out, NPR is inviting you to share how you invited people into this part of your life.</p>
<p>Your story could be featured in the <em>Up First</em> newsletter on Oct. 12. Use the form below and tell us about your coming out story. You can also upload a photo or send a voice memo. Photos should be taken by you and unedited.</p> <p><strong>Please submit responses by Oct. 1.</strong></p>

                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>

<p>An Immigration and Customs officer working at the New York immigration courts has been placed on administrative leave after video circulated online showed him pushing a woman toward a wall and to the ground, according to the Department of Homeland Security. </p> <p>The man appears to be the same officer involved in an arrest of a court observer last month, which was witnessed by NPR and caught on audio.</p>
<p>"The officer's conduct in this video is unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE," said DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. "Our ICE law enforcement are held to the highest professional standards and this officer is being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation."</p> <p><em>Video: Watch a federal agent pushing the wife of a detained man to the ground at the Jacob K. Javits building at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City:</em></p> <p>There have been growing tensions between federal law enforcement and the public in immigration courts as federal agents are tasked with making more arrests. Over the last five months, ICE has increased its footprint inside immigration courthouses, which are operated by the Justice Department. The agents' presence and arrests in courthouses, particularly in New York, have resulted in conflicting mandates and instances of explosive anger, as NPR previously reported.</p>
<p>In August, as NPR and a court observer — an immigrant advocate — entered the hall, federal enforcement brushed past. The agent, who was unmasked and had been sitting in the waiting area earlier, yelled at NPR: "stop f****** following me! Why are you f****** following me?" before turning and yelling the same thing at the court observer.</p> <p>"It's not f****** about you!" she retorted.</p> <p>As they turned the corner, more shouting could be heard.</p> <p>"Don't f****** touch me," the court observer yelled. "Why are you pushing me? Why are you shoving me? I am not following you!"</p>  <p>She was then taken into an enclosed elevator bay.</p> <p>At the time, DHS told NPR that the court observer had interrupted the agents. She was transferred to Federal Protective Service custody and issued two citations: trespassing in a secure area and failing to follow lawful commands from an officer.</p> <p>The latest incident, caught on several cell phones and cameras, shows a woman crying apparently after the arrest of her husband.</p> <p>The agent was captured yelling "adios" (or goodbye) several times before shoving the woman toward the wall and onto the floor before the crowd.</p>
