                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
                <html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The battle over next year's federal education budget has begun.</p> <p>Congress and the White House have released not one, not two, but <em>three</em> competing funding visions for the nation's K-12 schools in fiscal year 2026. And education researchers warn that two of those three proposals — from the White House and House Republicans — would impose steep cuts on some of the United States' most vulnerable students and disadvantaged school communities.</p> <h3 class="edTag">The three proposals on the table</h3> <p>First up, President Trump's proposed budget would cut U.S. Department of Education funding by 15%. It would eliminate all funding ($1.3 billion) for English language learners and migrant students. It would also combine 18 funding streams — including help for rural schools, civics education, at-risk youth and students experiencing homelessness — and cut them from roughly $6.5 billion down to $2 billion.</p>
<p>The White House has defended this consolidation, saying it "requires fewer Federal staff and empowers States and districts to make spending decisions based on their needs."</p> <p>The second proposal, from House Republicans, would push for even deeper K-12 cuts, notably a $4.7 billion reduction in funding that supports schools in low-income communities. This funding stream, known as Title I, has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades and currently sends roughly $18 billion to schools in disadvantaged communities all over the United States.</p> <p>In a news release heralding the legislation, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Republican Tom Cole of Oklahoma, said, "Change doesn't come from keeping the status quo—it comes from making bold, disciplined choices."</p> <p>And the<strong> </strong>third proposal, from the Senate, would make minor cuts but largely maintain funding.</p> <p>A quick reminder: Federal funding makes up a relatively small share of school budgets, roughly 11%, though cuts in low-income districts can still be painful and disruptive.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Schools in blue congressional districts could lose more money</h3> <p>Researchers at the liberal-leaning think tank New America wanted to know how the impact of these proposals might vary depending on the politics of the congressional district receiving the money. They found that the Trump budget would subtract an average of about $35 million from each district's K-12 schools, with those led by Democrats losing slightly more than those led by Republicans.</p>
<p>The House proposal would make deeper, more partisan cuts, with districts represented by Democrats losing an average of about $46 million and Republican-led districts losing about $36 million.</p> <p>Republican leadership of the House Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for this budget proposal, did not respond to an NPR request for comment on this partisan divide.</p> <p>"In several cases, we've had to make some very hard choices," Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., a top Republican on the appropriations committee, said during the full-committee markup of the bill. "Americans must make priorities as they sit around their kitchen tables about the resources they have within their family. And we should be doing the same thing."</p>
<p>The Senate proposal is more moderate and would leave the status quo largely intact.</p> <p>In addition to the work of New America, the liberal-leaning Learning Policy Institute created this tool to compare the potential impact of the Senate bill with the president's proposal.</p> <h3 class="edTag">High-poverty schools could lose more than low-poverty schools</h3> <p>The Trump and House proposals would disproportionately hurt high-poverty school districts, according to an analysis by the liberal-leaning EdTrust.</p>
<p>In Kentucky, for example, EdTrust estimates that the president's budget could cost the state's highest-poverty school districts $359 per student, nearly three times what it would cost its wealthiest districts.</p> <p>The cuts are even steeper in<strong> </strong>the House proposal: Kentucky's highest-poverty schools could lose $372 per student, while its lowest-poverty schools could lose $143 per child.</p> <p>The Senate bill would cut far less: $37 per child in the state's highest-poverty school districts versus $12 per student in its lowest-poverty districts.</p> <p>New America researchers arrived at similar conclusions when studying congressional districts.</p> <p>"The lowest-income congressional districts would lose one and a half times as much funding as the richest congressional districts under the Trump budget," says New America's Zahava Stadler.</p> <p>The House proposal, Stadler says, would go further, imposing a cut the Trump budget does not on Title I.</p> <p>"The House budget does something new and scary," Stadler says, "which is it openly targets funding for students in poverty. This is not something that we see <em>ever</em>."</p> <p>Republican leaders of the House Appropriations Committee did not respond to NPR requests for comment on their proposal's outsize impact on low-income communities.</p> <p>The Senate has proposed a modest increase to Title I for next year.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Majority-minority schools could lose more than mostly white schools</h3> <p>Just as the president's budget would hit high-poverty schools hard, New America found that it would also have an outsize impact on congressional districts where schools serve predominantly children of color. These districts would lose nearly twice as much funding as predominantly white districts, in what Stadler calls "a huge, huge disparity<em>."</em></p>
<p>One of several drivers of that disparity is the White House's decision to end all funding for English language learners and migrant students. In one budget document, the White House justified cutting the former by arguing the program "deemphasizes English primacy. ... The historically low reading scores for all students mean States and communities need to unite—not divide—classrooms."</p> <p>Under the House proposal, according to New America, congressional districts that serve predominantly white students would lose roughly $27 million on average, while districts with schools that serve mostly children of color would lose more than twice as much: nearly $58 million.</p>
<p>EdTrust's data tool tells a similar story, state by state. For example, under the president's budget, Pennsylvania school districts that serve the most students of color would lose $413 per student. Districts that serve the fewest students of color would lose just $101 per child.</p> <p>The findings were similar for the House proposal: a $499-per-student cut in Pennsylvania districts that serve the most students of color versus a $128 cut per child in predominantly white districts.</p> <p>"That was most surprising to me," says EdTrust's Ivy Morgan. "Overall, the House proposal really is worse [than the Trump budget] for high-poverty districts, districts with high percentages of students of color, city and rural districts. And we were not expecting to see that."</p> <p>The Trump and House proposals do share one common denominator: the belief that the federal government should be spending less on the nation's schools.</p> <p>When Trump pledged, "We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs," that apparently included scaling back some of the federal role in funding schools, too.</p> <p>The challenge for states, communities and families, if one of these budgets becomes a reality, will be filling that funding void, especially since the federal government has always focused its dollars on helping students and schools that need it the most.</p>

                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
                <html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">

<p>The Trump administration recently approached a coalition of U.S. investors set to take over TikTok's U.S. operations with an ask: Will the group make a payment to the federal government "in the low billions," according to a person with direct knowledge of the talks.</p>
<p>The response from the investors, which includes tech mogul Larry Ellison, the Murdochs and venture capital heavyweight Andreessen Horowitz, was an unequivocal yes.</p> <p>"Not a single member balked," said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly. "They see it as something of a finders' fee."</p> <p>Welcome to President Trump's new business agenda: Extracting payments as if the federal government is brokering deals like a white-shoe consulting firm fueled by lucrative "fees for service."</p>
<p>Whether it's the U.S. taking 15% of Nvidia and AMD's chip sales to China, the federal government securing a "golden share" in U.S. Steel or the Trump administration reportedly seeking an equity stake in Lithium Americas as part of a government loan negotiation, the White House is on a campaign of squeezing businesses with few parallels in modern history.</p> <p>"At a minimum, this now means there is a tax imposed on every major business transaction," said Luigi Zingales, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago. "But even worse, businesses will no longer be focused on innovating and creating value and instead the whole game now is rent-seeking. It's all about ingratiating yourself with Trump."</p> <p>The White House did not return a request for comment.</p> <p>Asked on Thursday about the multibillion-dollar fee expected to be tacked onto the TikTok deal, which was earlier reported by <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> Trump was evasive.</p> <p>"We're going to be announcing different things, but the U.S. comes out great," Trump said from the Oval Office.</p> 
<p>Trump has been more direct about defending his administration's private business interventions, including after Intel agreed to sell a 10% stake of the company to the U.S. government following Trump's calls for its chief executive to resign.</p>
<p>"The United States paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars. This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL," Trump posted last month.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Many media companies capitulate to Trump pressure</h3> <p>This pattern has played out across media, where Trump's longtime war against news organizations has escalated into marshaling the might of the federal government to force concessions.</p>
<p>The parent companies for ABC and CBS both settled lawsuits for $16 million following Trump lawsuits alleging mistreatment by the networks. The payments went to Trump's presidential library foundation and Trump's legal fees. Shortly after CBS's payment, federal regulators approved the sale of its parent company, Paramount, to Skydance Media, which is controlled by the Ellison family.</p>
<p>Media companies were already signaling their acquiescence to Trump before he won a second term.</p> <p>Ahead of the election, the billionaire owners of <em>The Washington Post</em> and <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> killed parallel editorial endorsements of Kamala Harris. They soon rewired their editorial pages to be less critical of Trump. Both owners — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for the <em>Post </em>and medical innovator Dr.<em> </em>Patrick Soon-Shiong for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> —have major business interests that hinge on decisions by federal officials.</p>
<p>Then there is Jimmy Kimmel. Last week, Disney — which owns ABC — suspended the late-night host after Federal Communications Chairman Brendan Carr threatened action over Kimmel's remarks about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. After a public outcry, including from First Amendment scholars, Kimmel returned, on Tuesday, with the blessing of ABC and Disney.</p> 
<p>Trump lashed out at the network's reversal.</p> <p>"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back," Trump wrote on Truth Social, writing in the same post: "I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Trump allies landing deals sparks criticism of "crony capitalism"</h3> <p>Among those the Trump White House has lined up to take the reins of TikTok's U.S. operation are Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, the controlling owners of Fox News, <em>The New York Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.</p> <p>From one view, it can be seen as recognition of the friendly coverage the president often receives from Fox and <em>The Post</em>.</p>
<p>But Trump and Murdoch have also been at odds. That strife was highlighted in July when Trump sued <em>The Journal </em>and Murdoch over the paper's reporting on the disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein.</p> <p>The Murdochs' role in the take-over of America's most popular video app is a remarkable victory for the family and follows a relationship that has at times been combative.</p> 
<p>"If you look at Fox News on the one hand and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> editorial page on the other, I think it's very clear that Rupert Murdoch wants to have bets on every square on the roulette table," says Richard Tofel, who was the former assistant publisher of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> prior to Murdoch's 2007 acquisition of the paper.</p> <p>But most of the stakeholders in the TikTok investment group are business leaders who have shown sustained loyalty to the president, which makes the deal look like a reward for fealty, Tofel says.</p> <p>"There is a growing set of examples of crony capitalism that the Trump administration is putting into place across this country," says Tofel, a lawyer who later went on to become president of the non-profit investigative news site ProPublica. "American industry — which would have regarded this behavior from a Democrat as anathema and inconsistent with the tenets of unfettered capitalism — is rolling over for it time after time."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Experts say U.S. economy being undermined by 'shake-down schemes'</h3> <p>The exact template has varied. In the case of TikTok, the administration is seeking a fee for service. With Intel, the federal government is acquiring an equity stake. For chip-makers Nvidia and AMD, meanwhile, the demand was for a slice of future profits. And with the network television settlements, the payouts arose after personal legal disputes.</p>
<p>"There is no consistent principle at play, just the exercise of Trump's personal power over other people's money," said Dael Norwood, associate professor of history at the University of Delaware, who notes that the winners and losers are clear.</p> <p>"All Americans – taxpayers, investors, customers, and workers – lose with crony capitalism," he said. "It increases everyone's costs, makes everyone more vulnerable to extortion (or worse), and profoundly degrades our expectations for honesty and fair dealing, society-wide."</p> <p>In public, corporate executives show support to the president and appear to back such deals, but behind closed doors, some business leaders are expressing deep concern.</p>
<p>Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld recently helped organize a gathering of more than 100 top CEOs, and he said there was near-unanimous consensus in surveys conducted at the event that Trump's interventions in private business are undermining America's free market principles.</p> <p>"These are shake-down schemes. It's a gross violation of what capitalism is supposed to stand for. I'd even call it extortion," Sonnenfeld said. "Privately, CEOs are horrified."</p> <p>But Sonnenfeld said executives are not banding together to push back on Trump, as top business leaders did following Trump's election denialism in November 2020.</p> <p>"CEOs need to speak up, like they did then, but they aren't doing it publicly," Sonnenfeld said. "Fear of retaliation is motivating the silence, but there has got to be a trigger line to stop this,"We just don't know what that is yet."</p> <p>Talks with American investors for a potential acquisition of TikTok's U.S. enterprise have been moving in fits and starts for the past five years, starting back when the Trump administration declared the Chinese-owned hit video app to be a national security threat and sought to have it banned.</p> <p>Since Trump's about-face and embrace of TikTok, it has been clear that software and cloud-computing company Oracle would be a major player in the bid to take over the app's American presence.</p>
<p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is a close confidante of Trump and the president has said both publicly and in private that he'd like to see TikTok controlled by Oracle.</p> <p>According to the source with direct knowledge of the talks, many of the deal's provisions have been under discussion for months, including that Oracle will host and oversee all of Americans' TikTok data. Beijing-based ByteDance will license its algorithm to the U.S. entity to be re-trained based only on the 170 million U.S. users of the app and ByteDance will keep a minority stake in the company.</p> <p>The one part of the agreement that caught investors by surprise? The multibillion-dollar fee request.</p> <p>"They were taken aback when they were told they'd have to kick in," the source said. "But I think they see it as just the price of doing business right now."</p>

                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
                <html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">

<p>PROVO, Utah — On a sunny Monday morning, dozens of people trickled into the Utah Valley Convention Center in this town enveloped by mountains south of Salt Lake City. Some wore suits, others high heels, and nearly all carried small binders with resumes, certificates and diplomas.</p> <p>They were veterans, current law enforcement officials, college graduates and fired federal workers.</p> <p>They came from California, Texas, Georgia, Arkansas and Utah.</p> <p>And they want to be deportation officers, or work for other parts of the Department of Homeland Security, the agency leading President Trump's mass deportation policy.</p> <p>The Trump administration wants to recruit 10,000 people for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a branch of DHS, using congressional funds approved earlier this summer. The administration's goal is to deport one million people a year. But that target is unlikely to be easy to hit: The lack of personnel to conduct arrests, investigate and litigate cases has been among the biggest challenges to increasing the pace of arrests, detentions and deportations.</p>
<p>NPR spoke with more than 30 people at the DHS career expo held in Provo last week. This was the first agency-wide career fair after Congress approved funds to recruit candidates for positions beyond immigration enforcement, including for the Secret Service, Federal Protective Police and the Transportation Security Administration, which like ICE are all part of DHS. Interviews conducted by NPR suggest many of the people who had traveled across state lines to Utah wanted to work in immigration enforcement.</p> <p>More than 1,500 people registered for the event, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in a statement. DHS extended 500 tentative job offers, with 370 for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.</p> <p>"Many of the candidates who attended the expo had started the application process before attending and were completing things on their to-do list, such as drug tests, finger printing, and more," McLaughlin said. "Attending the in-person career expo helped candidates expedite their hiring process with a one-stop shop to complete their applications."</p> <p>ICE had about 20,000 people at the start of the year, 6,000 of them in roles directly conducting deportations. Last week ICE boasted receiving more than 150,000 applications nationwide and extending 18,000 tentative job offers — though it is unclear how many will ultimately see a first day on the job.</p>
<p>DHS officials have raised concerns over what they said is a 1,000% increase in threats to their officers. Officials reiterated that statistic after a fatal shooting at the Dallas ICE field office this week killed one person and injured two others — all immigrants detained there — and bullets were found with the words "ANTI-ICE."</p> <p>Acting Director Todd Lyons told CNN after the shooting that the threats have not negatively affected recruitment efforts.</p> <p>"There's really excitement for people that want to serve, not just necessarily ICE but want to serve in a federal law enforcement capacity, especially at a time when assaults and attacks on law enforcement are increasing," Lyons said. "We are seeing a great uptick in our recruitment, so people definitely want to do the job."</p> <h3 class="edTag">The recruits</h3> <p>As part of its recruitment campaign, DHS offered signing bonuses, lifted age restrictions and roped in celebrities like actor Dean Cain, who played Clark Kent/Superman in <em>Lois and Clark</em>, to encourage more people to apply.</p> <p>Ana Maria Vargas, 52, a correctional officer in Arizona, applied to be a deportation officer.</p>
<p>"I saw … the guy that played Superman on the TV series so many years ago," Vargas said. "A lot of us still have the desire and want to serve our country, yet we don't know how to get into it because of the age restrictions."</p> <p>Vargas said she wants to "take out the bad guys," though she acknowledged "there are a lot of good people that are here. However, they are here illegally."</p> <p>Andrea Alexander, an attorney living in Utah, came to apply for the Office of the Principal Legal Advisor, the branch of ICE that argues immigration cases in immigration court. She learned of ICE's recruitment efforts from White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller's social media.</p> <p>"I love Trump. I love his administration. I think he's going to save our country," Alexander said, adding that those applying to be deportation officers should likely believe in the mission as well. "They probably have to be true believers for the front line because they have to be ready to catch a lot of flak right now."</p>
<p>Still, Alexander said she wanted to see efforts to increase legal migration and visa reform.</p> <p>"We've made it almost impossible for people to immigrate legally. It's very difficult and they should be able to come over," she added.</p> <p>Another applicant, Peter, who did not want to disclose his last name since he is applying to be a deportation officer, flew to Utah from Arkansas.</p> <p>He said he was on the right of the political spectrum and that the hiring bonuses and increased media attention on the agency drew his attention.</p> <p>"I think there's way too many illegal immigrants here," he said, noting that if he gets the job, he hopes he gets to deport people. </p> <h3 class="edTag">Former federal employees seek a second chance</h3><h3 class="edTag"></h3> <p>Sherrell Pyatt was one of several DHS employees laid off as part of a broader effort to reduce the size of the federal government. NPR reported her story in April. But months later, she flew from Georgia to Utah with the hopes of being rehired at the agency that let her go.</p> <p><strong>"</strong>I want to be judged on my qualifications, my credentials, and I don't feel like I've been given that opportunity," Pyatt said, noting that her severance had ended in August.</p> <p>She wanted to apply for a role with the fraud investigations unit of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. After working in the federal government for 10 years, Pyatt, who worked in the federal government for a decade, said that she wants to continue her service and believes she should have priority to be rehired since she was a part of a reduction in force, but is competing with external candidates.</p> 
<p>"If there is an opportunity where I could plug into something that would work for me and my skill set, I would, of course, apply," she said.</p>
<p>Other laid-off federal workers, including from other agencies, as well as contractors, came to the expo to look for opportunities.</p> <p>Eddie — who did not provide a last name since he is applying for a role with Homeland Security Investigations, which is a part of ICE, and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services — previously worked as a federal contractor to vet the sponsors of unaccompanied migrant children.</p> <p>"My dad's been with law enforcement at Homeland Security now for 17 years and he does pretty well. So I firsthand see the benefits of it," he said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Concerns over DHS's widespread recruitment comes from all sides</h3> <p>The numbers at the recruitment events notwithstanding, ICE's recruitment strategies have not all been well received.</p> <p>Utah County Sheriff Mike Smith, who has an agreement to assist ICE in the Provo area, called an initial call to recruit local law enforcement "unprofessional" in an interview with NPR. The recruitment fair in Provo, as well as an ICE-specific fair in Texas, were met with scattered protests.</p> <p>RJ Hauman, a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he supports the administration's immigration enforcement goals, but said he is skeptical about the recruitment campaign.</p>
<p>"When you're recruiting large numbers of qualified candidates, you got to consider how you get them to the finish line," Hauman said. "Rather than doing ads that ICE is hiring, all these onsite job fairs, let's start hammering out more facilities to train these potential agents and streamline the vetting, the background check, make sure you get the right people and you don't make a mistake."</p> <p>Critics say the modification of requirements, including a reduced training period, could result in hiring candidates with less experience. The agency insists standards aren't being lowered: ICE law enforcement recruits will still be required to go through medical screening, drug screening and a physical fitness test. </p>
<h3 class="edTag">Just another job</h3> <p>ICE's enforcement efforts have made the agency the focus of negative attention, protests and lawsuits. But like for many who work in the federal government, the politics of the moments are irrelevant.</p> <p>John Heubert, who expects to retire from the Army next summer, came from Georgia to apply to be a deportation officer.</p> <p>"I feel like I could do good in that realm. I've been military for 23 years. I've worked in detainee operations for a long time," Heubert said. "So I feel like leveraging my skills, and deployments, and everything would help kind of transition me easier into the civilian life, doing kind of the same thing I've been doing."</p> <p>He said everything has been politicized, so the controversy surrounding the agency did not deter him.</p> <p>"I'm the guy that just executes at this point. So whatever they want, they tell me to do it, I go do," Heubert said.</p> <p>Alan Richardson, who came to the expo from Utah, is another veteran. He learned of the expo from a friend's post on LinkedIn.</p> <p>"I want to go back into federal service … and retire earlier than have to start a whole another career with a state or county agency," he said, noting he is interested in border patrol, Secret Service and ICE.</p> <p>"As a law enforcement officer, you don't get to pick and choose which laws to enforce. You enforce them as they are on the books," Heubert said. "There is no politics behind it. If you want to change laws, you have to go to Congress. That's simply all it is."</p> <p>Richardson said that he supports the effort to arrest and deport criminals.</p> <p>"If your employer says you have to do something, you've got to go do it. That's any business in the country. Everyone can have an opinion," Richardson said. "But I think going after the criminals is the goal here. There's no way you're going to deport how many millions of people that are here illegally."</p>
<p>Eric Garibay, an immigration detention officer, said he drove over 12 hours from El Paso, Texas, to attend the fair. Speaking to NPR in Spanish, he said it has always been his goal to be a border patrol agent.</p> <p>"It's a job and a career that I chose, so you have to move forward," he said.</p> <p>As for the people he'd be detaining, he said: "It hurts to see. They're human, but a job is a job."</p>

                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
                <html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">

<p>This week, President Trump urged pregnant women to "tough it out" and take Tylenol sparingly on the basis that there's a link between the active ingredient in the pain killer, acetaminophen, and autism.</p> <p>Medical experts have strongly pushed back on the guidance, arguing that such claims are misleading and research shows there's no causal link between acetaminophen and autism. The Food and Drug Administration also later clarified that "while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature."</p>
<p>Still, the remarks on Monday sparked confusion, worry and guilt among pregnant women and families with children who have autism. Medical scholars say it's part of a pattern in the history of medicine and autism research.</p> <p>" We really have a long history of blaming mothers in this country, and we're seeing that reinforced through the narratives around autism's causes right now," said Martine Lappé, a sociology professor at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, who has studied how autism science and advocacy have affected families.</p> <p>Autism spectrum disorder, as it is officially called, is a complex neurodevelopmental condition, with a wide range of characteristics and support levels. There are more than 100 genes associated with it. Historically, efforts to find a singular cause for autism has led to scrutinizing parents and fueling stigma about autism, Lappé added.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>In the mid-20th century, working moms were wrongly associated with autism </strong></h3> <p>In the 1940s, not long after autism was recognized as a distinct condition, blame quickly fell on mothers — specifically those with careers or college degrees.</p> <p>The leading child psychiatrist at the time, Leo Kanner, observed that many of his young patients with autism had mothers who were highly educated or working professionals, and also seemed emotionally cold. Kanner concluded that a lack of parental warmth drove children to retreat into behaviors associated with autism, in what later became known as the "refrigerator mom" theory.</p>
<p>" A cold mother, at the time, pretty much meant an intellectual mother, a mother who had other interests besides raising her children," said Marga Vicedo, a historian of science at the University of Toronto, Canada, who has published a book on the history of the "refrigerator mom" theory.</p> <p>According to Vicedo, the number of educated mothers in Kanner's studies could have been explained by other factors, like the fact that many of them came from middle-to-upper class backgrounds, where higher education was more common.</p>
<p>Still, the concept grew in popularity — in part because it emerged amid growing tensions between women entering the workforce and societal pressure for women to return to traditional roles at home in the post-World War II era.</p> <p>"At the end of day, saying it's a mother's fault is a very strong and powerful way of keeping mothers as the main caretakers," she said.</p> <p>The "refrigerator mom" theory had devastating impacts on mothers — fueling shame, guilt and even harmful practices. In the 1960s, child psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim advocated for separating autistic children from their mothers, according to Vicedo.</p> <p>Over time, as research increasingly pointed to genetics as a major factor in autism, the theory was discredited. Parents and specifically mothers also became more vocal in challenging claims that they were to blame.</p> <p>Today, Vicedo said she sees parallels between the rhetoric around "refrigerator moms" and "Tylenol" — mainly in the tendency to pin autism on a singular cause, despite its complexity.</p> <p>"The continued focus on what mothers do places a tremendous burden and a lot of stress on them," she said.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Vaccine skepticism and the tendency to oversimplify autism </strong></h3> <p>A few decades after the "refrigerator mom" theory was debunked, a new culprit was front and center: vaccines.</p> <p>In 1998, researcher Andrew Wakefield claimed there was a link between autism and the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, also known as the MMR vaccine.</p>
<p>Wakefield's study has since been retracted, his claim has been repeatedly disproven and he lost his medical license in the U.K. But that process took time and resources which could have gone toward other autism research, according to Lappé from Cal Poly.</p> <p>Similar to the "refrigerator mom" theory, Lappé said the vaccine autism myth placed too much focus on parents' choices for a condition that's largely genetic and multi-faceted.</p> <p>"Mothers, I think, felt a lot of individual blame and responsibility if their children did have autism," she said.</p> <p>According to Lappé, these misleading narratives on causation also take attention away from more meaningful and productive conversations, like access to healthcare, childcare and research that promotes neurodiversity.</p> <p>" If the goal is truly to promote health and wellness, then we need policies that support what we know mothers and caregivers need," she said.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Tylenol and the pressure to 'tough it out'</strong></h3> <p>Medical experts and scholars worry that the recent claims about Tylenol put pregnant women and families in a difficult bind.</p> <p>" It really puts women and mothers and medical providers in this really challenging situation because women are now being told differing stories from different individuals," said Dr. Rachel Follmer, a developmental and behavioral pediatrician at Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, who sees patients with autism.</p> <p>Follmer is also worried that pregnant women might avoid treating pain altogether to steer clear of Tylenol, which is the most commonly recommended pain reliever during pregnancy. Ignoring fevers or pain can also pose serious health risks, Follmer added.</p>
<p>According to the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, an "untreated fever, particularly in the first trimester, increases the risk of miscarriage, birth defects, and premature birth."</p> <p>Sarah Richardson, a professor of the history of science, as well as studies of women, gender and sexuality at Harvard University, said the remarks about Tylenol also put women in a position to be scrutinized, like whether they are doing enough or sacrificing enough for their children.</p> <p>" We live in an era of intensive pressure around parenting and expectations that one will do whatever possible to optimize outcome," she said. "And there's very little tolerance for the idea that there are many things not under our control."<br/></p>

                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
                <html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">

<p>LOS ANGELES — A lack of resources and outdated policies for sending emergency alerts led to delayed evacuation warnings as flames began consuming neighborhoods during deadly Los Angeles-area wildfires in January, according to an outside review.</p>
<p>The Independent After-Action Report produced by the consulting firm McChrystal Group was commissioned by Los Angeles County supervisors just weeks after the Eaton and Palisades fires killed more than 30 people and destroyed thousands of homes in and around Pacific Palisades and Altadena.</p> <p>The report released Thursday says a series of weaknesses, including "outdated policies, inconsistent practices and communications vulnerabilities," hampered the county's response.</p> <p>Interviews with survivors and an Associated Press analysis of available data found evacuation orders for some neighborhoods of Altadena where the Eaton Fire swept through came long after houses burned down. AP reporting also showed similar delays for the Palisades Fire, though the Los Angeles Police Department initially handled evacuation management. The report sheds more light on flaws in the county alert system.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>Staffing shortages</strong></h3> <p>The report cites critical staffing shortages including a high number of sheriff's deputy vacancies and an under-resourced Office of Emergency Management. In addition, first responders and incident commanders were unable to consistently share information due to unreliable cellular connectivity, inconsistent field reporting methods, and the use of various unconnected communication platforms.</p>
<p>"While frontline responders acted decisively and, in many cases, heroically, in the face of extraordinary conditions, the events underscored the need for clearer policies, stronger training, integrated tools, and improved public communication," the report says.</p> <p>It is not intended to investigate or assess blame, county officials said in a news release.</p> <p>"This isn't about pointing fingers. It's about learning lessons, improving safety, and restoring public trust," said Supervisor Kathryn Barger, whose district includes Altadena.</p> <p>The Office of Emergency Management began putting together its staffing plan for predicted heavy winds Jan. 3, four days before the Palisades and Eaton fires ignited. But an experienced staffer had been sent out of town for a training event. That meant several less-knowledgeable staffers were in key positions, according to the report.</p>
<p>They were also working with some new emergency notification software provided by an existing vendor: The county signed the expanded contract with emergency alert company Genasys in November, just before the holidays. Only four staff members were trained on Genasys when the fires hit, according to the report.</p> 
<p>The review also found that the process to communicate an evacuation decision to the public was slow, convoluted and involved multiple leadership roles across county-level departments.</p> <p>In the case of the Palisades Fire, the Los Angeles County Fire Department and Sheriff's Department identified areas that required evacuation. </p>
<p>They then communicated those areas to a member of the County's Office of Emergency Management at the Incident Command center. This person then made a phone call or sent a text message to another OEM staffer located in the Emergency Operations Center, who then updated the system put in place by the third-party vendor and triggered an alert to the public.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Alerting the public</strong></h3> <p>During the January inferno, according to the report, this process took between 20 and 30 minutes. That's an improvement over the old system that took between 30 and 60 minutes for the public to receive notice of an evacuation, the report said.</p> <p>Still, many of the county's methods to alert the public require opting in.</p>
<p>Some of the evacuation alerts required residents to click a separate link to get complete information, hindering messaging. The communication system used for alerts did not provide complete information about the fire's progression. Power outages and cell tower issues further hindered evacuation notices and the fire was moving too fast to keep up, the report found.</p> <p>Before the fire, the county sent out a handful of warnings about the incoming Santa Ana wind event and amplified National Weather Service messaging on social media and in news releases, but there was no official, stand-alone preparedness messaging provided by the county.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Challenges during evacuations</strong></h3> <p>Some sheriff's department vehicles were aiding with evacuations in the Palisades area when the Eaton Fire broke out across the county. Those units headed to help evacuate residents in Altadena, along with responders from other agencies including search and rescue teams and staff from a downtown LA jail.</p> <p>Still, a shortage of vehicles hindered the sheriff's department response across neighborhoods where the Eaton Fire was burning.</p>
<p>"Vulnerable populations, especially older residents who were not monitoring alerts due to a digital divide and possible mobility challenges, faced increased risks of delayed evacuation," the authors wrote.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>What went right</strong></h3> <p>The authors praised the heroism of first responders including sheriff's deputies and county firefighters who evacuated senior care facilities, led public transit bus drivers through impacted neighborhoods and rescued people from burning homes.</p> 
<p>"This heroic response was driven by urgency and their commitment to save lives, but it also added additional complexity to their responsibilities as they worked to maintain broader operational oversight in the field," the authors wrote.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to review the 133-page report when it meets next Tuesday.</p> <p>The causes of the two fires are still under investigation.</p>
<p>After-action reports and investigations revealed issues with alert systems in other California blazes: in the 2017 Tubbs Fire, which killed 22 people in Santa Rosa; the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed 85 people in Paradise; the Woolsley fire, which started the same day and killed three in Malibu; as well as in Colorado's 2021 Marshall Fire, which destroyed more than 1,000 homes outside Denver; and in Hawaii's 2023 Lahaina Fire, which decimated that historic town and killed 102.  </p>

<p>WENATCHEE, Wash. — Forensic tests confirmed that human remains found on a remote mountain in Washington state this month were those of Travis Decker, a former soldier wanted for killing his three young daughters last spring, officials confirmed Thursday.</p>
<p>His remains were discovered on a steep, remote, wooded slope part way up Grindstone Mountain in central Washington, less than a mile (1.6 km) from the campsite where the bodies of 9-year-old Paityn Decker, 8-year-old Evelyn Decker and 5-year-old Olivia Decker were found on June 2, the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said.</p> <p>Law enforcement teams had been searching more than three months for Decker, 32, before the sheriff's office announced last week it had located human remains believed to be his. Sheriff Mike Morrison said Thursday that DNA tests on clothing found at the scene as well as from the remains matched Decker.</p>
<p>The sheriff said investigators wanted to honor the girls' memory by solving the case, and he apologized to their mother, Whitney Decker, that it took so long.</p> <p>"I hope you can rest easier at night knowing that Travis is accounted for," Morrison said.</p> <p>Decker had been with his daughters on a scheduled visit but failed bring them back to his former wife, who a year ago said that his mental health issues had worsened and that he had become increasingly unstable.</p> 
<p>He was often living out of his truck, she said in a petition seeking to restrict him from having overnight visits with them.</p> <p>A deputy found Decker's truck as well as the girls' bodies three days after Decker failed to return them to their mother's house. Autopsies found the girls had been suffocated.</p> <p>Decker was an infantryman in the Army from March 2013 to July 2021 and deployed to Afghanistan for four months in 2014. He had training in navigation, survival and other skills, authorities said, and once spent more than two months living in the backwoods off the grid.</p> <p>More than 100 officials with an array of state and federal agencies searched hundreds of square miles, much of it mountainous and remote, by land, water and air during the on and off search. The U.S. Marshals Service offered a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his capture.</p>
<p>At one point early in the search, authorities thought they spotted Decker near a remote alpine lake after receiving a tip from hikers.</p> <p>Officials say the coroner's office continues to work on determining the cause and time of his death.</p>

                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
                <html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">

<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will put import taxes of 100% on pharmaceutical drugs, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30% on upholstered furniture and 25% on heavy trucks starting on Oct. 1.</p> <p>The posts on his social media site showed that Trump's devotion to tariffs did not end with the trade frameworks and import taxes that were launched in August, a reflection of the president's confidence that taxes will help to reduce the government's budget deficit while increasing domestic manufacturing.</p> <p>While Trump did not provide a legal justification for the tariffs, he appeared to stretch the bounds of his role as commander-in-chief by stating on Truth Social that the taxes on imported kitchen cabinets and sofas were needed "for National Security and other reasons."</p>
<p>Under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the administration launched a Section 232 investigation in April about the impacts on national security from pharmaceutical drug and truck imports. The Commerce Department launched a 232 investigation into timber and lumber in March, though it's unclear whether the furniture tariffs stem from that.</p>
<p>The tariffs are another dose of uncertainty for the U.S. economy with a solid stock market but a weakening outlook for jobs and elevated inflation. These new taxes on imports could pass through to consumers in the form of higher prices and dampen hiring, a process that economic data suggests is already underway.</p> <p>"We have begun to see goods prices showing through into higher inflation," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned in a recent news conference, adding that higher costs for goods account for "most" or potentially "all" of the increase in inflation levels this year.</p> <p>The president has pressured Powell to resign, arguing that the Fed should cut its benchmark interest rates more aggressively because inflation is no longer a concern. Fed officials have stayed cautious on rate cuts because of the uncertainty created by tariffs.</p> <p>Trump said on Truth Social that the pharmaceutical tariffs would not apply to companies that are building manufacturing plants in the United States, which he defined as either "breaking ground" or being "under construction." It was unclear how the tariffs would apply to companies that already have factories in the U.S.</p>
<p>In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shock waves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.</p> <p>The pharmaceutical drug announcement was shocking as Trump has previously suggested that tariffs would be phased in over time so that companies had time to build factories and relocate production. On CNBC in August, Trump said he would start by charging a "small tariff" on pharmaceuticals and raise the rate over a year or more to 150% and even 250%.</p> <p>According to the White House, the threat of tariffs earlier this year contributed to many major pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, Roche, Bristol Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly, among others, to announce investments in U.S. production.</p> <p>Pascal Chan, vice president for strategic policy and supply chains at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, warned that the tariffs could harm Americans' health with "immediate price hikes, strained insurance systems, hospital shortages, and the real risk of patients rationing or foregoing essential medicines."</p> <p>The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates. The National Association of Realtors on Thursday said there were signs of price pressures easing as sales listings increased 11.7% in August from a year ago, but the median price for an existing home was $422,600.</p> <p>Trump said that foreign-made heavy trucks and parts are hurting domestic producers that need to be defended.</p> <p>"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions," Trump posted.</p> <p>Trump has long maintained that tariffs are the key to forcing companies to invest more in domestic factories. He has dismissed fears that importers would simply pass along much of the cost of the taxes to consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices.</p>
<p>His broader country-by-country tariffs relied on declaring an economic emergency based on a 1977 law, a drastic tax hike that two federal courts said exceeded Trump's authority as president. The Supreme Court is set to hear the case in November.</p> <p>The president continues to claim that inflation is no longer a challenge for the U.S. economy, despite evidence to the contrary. The consumer price index has increased 2.9% over the past 12 months, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.</p> <p>Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.</p> <p>"There's no inflation," Trump told reporters Thursday. "We're having unbelievable success."</p> <p>Still, Trump also acknowledged that his tariffs against China had hurt American farmers, who lost out on sales of soybeans. The president separately promised on Thursday to divert tariff revenues to the farmers hurt by the conflict, just as he did during his first term in 2018 and 2019 when his tariffs led to retaliation against the agricultural sector.</p>

                <div class="article-source">NPR News</div>

<p>The Justice Department has leveled charges against former FBI Director James Comey, after President Trump demanded prosecutors speed up their pace in an investigation targeting one of his most prominent critics.</p> <p>Comey faces one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice in connection with his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee nearly five years ago. The move comes days after the top federal prosecutor in Northern Virginia cast doubt on the evidence, only to be forced out by the president and replaced with one of Trump's former defense attorneys.</p>
<p>"No one is above the law.," Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X. "Today's indictment reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people."</p> <p>Trump has long railed against Comey, blaming the former FBI leader for the appointment of a special prosecutor who probed contacts between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign through most of the president's first term in office. </p>
<p>The charges against Comey mark the latest escalation in a years-long war of words between Trump and Comey, who famously likened the president to a mob boss.</p> <p>This year the Secret Service interrogated the former FBI director after he posted a photo of seashells in the shape of the numbers "86 47." Comey later removed the post, saying he thought it was a restaurant-themed joke about removing Trump, the 47<sup>th</sup> president. But Trump's son and cabinet members interpreted the message as an assassination threat. "Eighty-six" is a slang term that means "get rid of," and Trump is the 47th (and 45th) president of the United States. </p> <p>Comey once served as second in command at the Justice Department, under President George W. Bush. But he started his career as a federal prosecutor, working to some acclaim in the same office in Virginia that later moved to seek his indictment.</p>
<p>DOJ fired his daughter, Maurene Comey, from a prominent job as an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan earlier this year, only hours after she said she had been asked to lead an important public corruption case. </p> <p>This month, Maurene Comey sued current Justice Department leaders, arguing she was fired without cause and in violation of the Constitution and federal statutes. Her lawsuit said she thought she was dismissed because of "her father's protected speech, or because of her perceived political affiliation and beliefs, or both."</p>

                <html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">

<p>Hollywood is divided over the war in Gaza and is expressing it through dueling open letters.</p> <p>More than 5,000 actors and filmmakers, including Pedro Pascal, Javier Bardem and Selena Gomez, signed an open letter on Sept. 9 pledging to boycott Israeli film groups.</p> <p>Now, more than 1,200 other Hollywood figures, among them Liev Schreiber, Mayim Bialik and Sharon Osbourne, have signed a similar letter <em>rejecting</em> the boycott.</p>
<p>"We cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda," states the letter, which was published on Thursday by the entertainment industry nonprofits Creative Community For Peace and The Brigade.</p> <p>Condemning the first open letter as "a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art," the signers ask the entertainment industry to "reject this discriminatory and antisemitic boycott call that only adds another roadblock on the path to peace." </p>
<p>The letter goes on to say that the pledge "erases dissenting Israeli voices, legitimizes falsehoods, and shields Hamas from blame."</p> <p>Addressing the signers of the boycott pledge, the letter urges, "If you want peace, "call for the immediate release of the remaining hostages" and "stand against Hamas."</p> <p>People who signed the original letter pledged to avoid screening films or working with Israeli film institutions that they allege are "implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people." It was published in five languages by Filmmakers for Palestine – which describes itself as "a call by and for filmmakers and cinema workers to stand for an end to genocide, and for a free Palestine." Israel strongly denies allegations that it is committing genocide in Gaza.</p> <p>In addition to Pascal, Bardem and Gomez, the original letter was signed by Emma Stone, Gael Garcia Bernal, Alyssa Milano, Olivia Colman, Brian Cox and Ilana Glazer, among many others. Filmmakers included Ava DuVernay, Adam McKay and Yorgos Lanthimos.</p> <p>In a statement to NPR, Filmmakers for Palestine dismissed the letter from Creative Community for Peace as "nothing more than thinly veiled anti-Palestinian racism."</p>
<p>The new letter has fewer A-list talent among its signatories. But it includes such behind-the-scenes heavyweights as former Paramount Global chair Shari Redstone, Mattel chairman and CEO Ynon Kreiz, <em>Will &amp; Grace</em> creator David Kohan, and Fernando Szew, CEO of FOX Entertainment Global.</p> <p>The letter follows a response to the boycott by Paramount Studios, the only major studio to speak out on the call for a boycott. "Silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace," a statement issued on behalf of Paramount chief communications officer Melissa Zukerman on Sept. 12 reads. "The global entertainment industry should be encouraging artists to tell their stories and share their ideas with audiences throughout the world. We need more engagement and communication — not less."<br/></p>
