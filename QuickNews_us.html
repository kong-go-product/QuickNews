<div class="article-title">WWE World Heavyweight Championship vacated due to Seth Rollins injury, title match set between top stars</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The World Heavyweight Championship was vacated on Monday after WWE Raw general manager Adam Pearce announced that Seth Rollins suffered an injury in Australia.</p><p>Rollins came out on top in a champion vs. champion matchup for the Crown Jewel Championship against Cody Rhodes at the Crown Jewel premium live event. On the "Monday Night Raw" after the event, Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed levied an attack on Rollins.</p><p>Paul Heyman suggested Rollins was dealing with a shoulder injury. Rollins’ timetable for his return was unclear, but multiple reports indicated that he could be back by the time WrestleMania 42 season rolls around next year. He was not on "Monday Night Raw" to give up the title. Breakker handed in the strap for him.</p><p>Pearce announced that a battle royal would take place later in the night. Pearce said Vision members Breakker and Reed would not be allowed to compete in the match. The winner would face CM Punk for the vacated championship at Saturday Night’s Main Event on Nov. 1. Punk won a triple-threat match over LA Knight and Jey Uso to earn a title shot last week.</p><p>Uso and Knight were among those in the battle royal and they fought to the bitter end.</p><p>As Knight was tangled up with Uso near the announcer-side ropes, Jey’s brother Jimmy came over to keep him in the match. Later, Jimmy Uso was tangled up with Knight and where Jimmy came over to help out his brother, Jey saw an opportunity.</p><p>Jey Uso eliminated his brother and Knight and then avoided getting eliminated himself by Dominik Mysterio. He shut the door on Mysterio’s hopes for a title shot and picked up the win, much to the chagrin of his twin brother.</p><p>It will be Punk and Uso squaring off for the vacated championship, but questions loom over the relationship of the Usos and whether The Vision will be lurking in the competitors’ rearview mirrors in the days to come before Saturday Night’s Main Event.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Lions put NFL on notice with statement win over Bucs</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Detroit Lions made a huge statement on Monday night with a 24-9 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p><p>The Lions hoped to avoid dropping their third game of the season as they welcomed the Buccaneers into Ford Field. Baker Mayfield was earning talk about being a candidate for the MVP, but also had to deal with injuries to two of his weapons in Mike Evans and Emeka Egbuka.</p><p>Detroit opened the game with a touchdown pass from Jared Goff to Amon-Ra St. Brown. Running back Jahmyr Gibbs followed up in the second quarter when he burst through a giant hole made by his offensive line and scored a 78-yard touchdown.</p><p>Goff was 20-of-29 for 241 yards, a touchdown pass and an interception. Gibbs ran for 136 yards and two touchdowns. He also had three catches for 82 yards.</p><p>Lions defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard was able to get his defense poised and ready to bother Mayfield and the Buccaneers all night long.</p><p>The defense was able to get to Mayfield four times in the game and force two turnovers.</p><p>The last time the Lions allowed fewer than 10 points was against the Minnesota Vikings in the final week of the 2024 regular season.</p><p>Evans and Egbuka came into the game banged up. Evans ended up leaving the game after he suffered a concussion and a shoulder injury. Egbuka was targeted several times but was unable to do enough to give Mayfield a lifeline during the game.</p><p>Bucs coach Todd Bowles said Evans suffered a broken clavicle and will likely miss most of the season.</p><p>Mayfield was 28-of-50 for 228 yards and a touchdown pass to Tez Johnson, who had four catches for 58 yards. Cade Otton led Buccaneers receivers with seven catches for 65 yards.</p><p>Detroit moved to 5-2 with the win and asserted itself as one of the top teams in the NFC. Despite losses to the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs, the Lions showed no signs of taking their feet off the gas pedal.</p><p> Tampa Bay fell to 5-2 and could really use a bye week to get healthy. The Buccaneers will get their wish in two weeks. Next week, they’ll hit the road to take on the New Orleans Saints.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Sarah Ferguson allegedly visited Jeffrey Epstein with royal daughters after prison release: report</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson allegedly brought her daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, to visit Jeffrey Epstein after he was released from jail in 2009, according to a report, citing leaked emails.</p><p>According to emails seen by the Mail on Sunday, Epstein messaged his lawyer, Paul Tweed, in April 2011 claiming Ferguson "was the first" to celebrate his release from jail with her "two daughters in tow."</p><p>In the summer of 2009, Epstein was released from a Florida jail after being sentenced to 18 months, following convictions for soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution. </p><p>A source told People that Eugenie and Beatrice never met Epstein. Another source told The Telegraph that neither Ferguson nor her daughters remember visiting Epstein after his release from jail.</p><p>The alleged email exchange came a month after Ferguson did an interview with the London Evening Standard in March 2011, issuing a "heartfelt apology" for accepting money from Epstein and claimed she wanted "nothing ever to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again."</p><p>The Mail on Sunday reported that Epstein emailed his lawyer, stating Ferguson "should affirmatively state that she was misquoted."</p><p>"[Sarah] took apartments in New York. She was the first to celebrate my release with her two daughters in tow. She visited me with [a] policeman sitting at my front desk. She has asked for help with her charities," Epstein reportedly wrote at the time.</p><p>Ferguson has admitted to accepting money from Epstein in the past, but the Mail on Sunday's new reporting suggests that Ferguson had asked Epstein for more.</p><p>"Is there any chance I could borrow 50 or 100,000 US dollars to help get through the small bills that are pushing me over? Had to ask," Ferguson allegedly asked Epstein via email, according to the Mail on Sunday.</p><p>The outlet reported that at the time of the request, Epstein was under house arrest following his release from jail and his bank accounts were being monitored. He reportedly did not complete the request and wrote Ferguson back: "You need to address these issues. You are great."</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Ferguson, Beatrice and Eugenie's representatives for comment.</p><p>Last month, leaked emails circulated of Ferguson calling Epstein a "supreme friend," which prompted multiple charities to drop her as a patron. </p><p>"Following the information shared this weekend on the Duchess of York's correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein, Julia's House has taken the decision that it would be inappropriate for her to continue as a patron of the charity," a spokesperson for Julia's House, a children's hospice organization, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "We have advised the Duchess of York of this decision and thank her for her past support."</p><p>According to the Associated Press, Ferguson has also been dropped by the Teenage Cancer Trust and Natasha Allergy Research Foundation. The Prevent Breast Cancer also announced they had dropped the duchess as patron.</p><p>The British Heart Foundation also dropped the duchess as the charity's ambassador, according to the BBC. The Children's Literacy Charity cut ties with Ferguson as well, the outlet reported. </p><p>In the alleged email, Ferguson referred to the disgraced sex offender as a "steadfast, generous and supreme friend."</p><p>"I know you feel hellaciously let down by me from what you were either told or read and I must humbly apologise to you and your heart for that," Ferguson allegedly wrote. </p><p>"I was advised, in no uncertain terms, to have nothing to do with you and to not speak or email you and if I did I would cause more problems to you, [Prince Andrew] and myself," she continued. "I was instructed to act with the utmost speed if I would have any chance of holding on to my career as a children’s book author and a children’s philanthropist."</p><p>In a statement to The Guardian, a representative for Ferguson said she stood by her public condemnation of Epstein. </p><p>"Like many people, she was taken in by [Epstein’s] lies. As soon as she was aware of the extent of the allegations against him, she not only cut off contact but condemned him publicly, to the extent that he then threatened to sue her for defamation for associating him with pedophilia," the statement read. "She does not resile from anything she said then. This email was sent in the context of advice the duchess was given to try to assuage Epstein and his threats."</p><p>On Oct. 17, Andrew released a statement shortly after excerpts were published from an upcoming posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who has alleged she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein and had sex with Andrew when she was 17.</p><p>"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family," a statement released by the royal, and obtained by Fox News Digital, read. "I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life."</p><p>"With His Majesty’s agreement, we feel I must now go a step further," the statement continued. "I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me."</p><p>Queen Elizabeth gave Andrew the title Duke of York when he married Ferguson in 1986. Ferguson became the Duchess of York even after their divorce in 1996. People reported that Ferguson has been going by her legal name for years now and will continue to do so now that Andrew's title has been stripped. The outlet reported that their daughters, Princess Beatrice and Prince Eugenie's titles, will remain intact.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A rising star in the Texas healthcare industry, recently honored on a national "40 Under 40" list, has been arrested with her husband after they left their six-month-old baby on a Florida beach, officials said.</p><p>According to the Walton County Sheriff’s Office, deputies were called to Miramar Beach around noon Oct. 10, after beachgoers found a baby alone beneath a tent near 4000 Sandestin Boulevard. </p><p>Witnesses told officers the baby had been alone for nearly an hour while the parents walked down the shoreline with their three other kids. Other beachgoers contacted local police.</p><p>According to a release shared on the Walton County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page, when deputies arrived, South Walton Fire District personnel assessed the baby and found she was not in distress. </p><p>Shortly afterward, Sara Sommers Wilks, 37, and Brian Wilks, 40, of Houston, Texas returned to the scene. </p><p>The couple reportedly admitted to placing their child under the tent for a nap before leaving. The Facebook press release said they claimed they had lost track of time.</p><p>Security footage reviewed by investigators also confirmed the pair had been gone for nearly an hour and had left their cell phones behind with the baby.</p><p>Both were arrested and charged with child neglect without great bodily harm, a third-degree felony under Florida law. </p><p>They were booked into the Walton County Jail and released the following day on a $1,000 bond each.</p><p>The Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) took custody of the couple’s four children until relatives from Texas could arrive to collect them. </p><p>Sommers Wilks serves as the Regional President for Southeast Texas at US Heart and Vascular, a healthcare group that supports cardiovascular practices in Texas, Alabama, and Arizona. </p><p>Earlier this year, she was featured in Cardiovascular Business magazine’s "Forty Under 40" list, which recognized her as an innovative and influential leader in cardiology administration.</p><p>In their Facebook statement, the Walton County Sheriff’s Office reiterated its commitment to child safety and expressed gratitude to those who intervened on the beach.</p><p>"We’re thankful for the quick-thinking beachgoer who raised the alarm and for those who stepped in to care for the child with the same kindness and concern they would show their own," said Sheriff Michael Adkinson in the post.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Walton County Sheriff's Office for further comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">John Stamos blames Lori Loughlin's 'narcissist' husband for her involvement in college admissions scandal</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>John Stamos defended his "Full House" co-star Lori Loughlin for putting up "with a lot over the years" during her relationship with estranged husband Mossimo Giannulli.</p><p>Loughlin and Giannulli are "living apart" now after 27 years of marriage, representatives confirmed to Fox News Digital. "There are no legal proceedings underway."</p><p>During Monday's episode of the "Good Guys" podcast, Stamos claimed it was the fashion designer who was responsible for getting Loughlin caught up in the 2019 college admissions scandal. </p><p>Their separation came five years after the couple were entangled in the Operation Varsity Blues scandal, pleading guilty to wire and mail fraud related to paying hundreds of thousands in bribes to get their daughters into the University of Southern California.</p><p>"40 years I’ve known her," Stamos said. "You can see through people after a few years. This woman’s a saint. I’m just heartbroken for her right now."</p><p>Stamos "really tried to be there" for his former co-star during the scandal, and claimed that Giannulli was "a terrible narcissist."</p><p>"I’m not going to debate whether she had much to do with it or not. I know she didn’t," he said before claiming Giannulli "dragged her through that."</p><p>"She’s not a liar. She’s a saint," Stamos said before remembering he called to check on Loughlin when the scandal news broke. She allegedly told him that "Mossimo handles all that stuff."</p><p>Loughlin served nearly three months in prison and Giannulli served five months behind bars. They were released in December 2020 and April 2021. </p><p>"She goes to f--ing prison for this a--hole for three months, right? And he goes for whatever," Stamos said. "And in typical Lori fashion, I said, ‘How was it?’ She goes, ‘You know, I met a lot of nice ladies in there. We have a book club.'"</p><p>He continued, "She didn’t deserve to be dragged through that … I know for a fact it was all him."</p><p>Stamos admitted that Loughlin was "just devastated" to split up with her husband of 27 years. </p><p>"For a girl who, you know, has lived her life really well, [is] a good person, a good mother, a good wife," he said. "I know all this for a fact. To be thrown into, now, this separation and exploding, blowing up her family this way. And I just hate to see her go through this."</p><p>When asked about cheating allegations, Stamos was "taking a fifth," but noted, "Whatever he did to her, it busted her up to the core."</p><p>Loughlin recently made light of the scandal when she played a version of herself in an episode of "Curb Your Enthusiasm." In the episode, main character Larry David helps the actress get into a country club when she’s bogged down with her legal drama. </p><p>Her character also has a fake handicapped license plate and cheats at golf. </p><p>In an interview with First for Women last year, Loughlin talked about perseverance. </p><p>"Every day, we’re met with different obstacles. But, for me, it’s like that song says, ‘I get knocked down, but I get up again,’" she said. "Nobody said life was going to be a breeze; we all make mistakes, but the important thing is to persevere."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre sparred with The Bulwark’s Tim Miller over former President Joe Biden’s interactions with the press on Monday.</p><p>Jean-Pierre appeared on "The Bulwark" podcast to promote her new memoir "Independent," which focuses on her time in the Biden administration. During the podcast, Miller criticized Biden as a poor communicator and asked her whether she ever spoke to him about his age.</p><p>Jean-Pierre said she never spoke to Biden about his age but argued that Biden communicated his ideas well "whether it broke through or not."</p><p>"He talked way less to the press than Donald Trump does," Miller pushed back. "Way less. And he wasn't out there at all. He wasn't good off the cuff. He wasn't doing press conferences. Let's just be real. Like, he didn't do events."</p><p>"But Tim, that's not true," Jean-Pierre interrupted. "Tim, you're conflating all of it. That's what you're… no, you're… first you're telling me he didn't talk well about it. Then you're telling me he didn't talk at all."</p><p>"He didn't do either. He didn't talk very often, and when he did, it wasn't very good. He sounded very old and feeble," Miller argued.</p><p>Jean-Pierre claimed that Miller wasn’t "paying attention" and insisted that Biden frequently spoke to the public.</p><p>"The president spoke to the American people a couple times a week. He traveled and did domestic travel and talked directly to the American people. We are talking about a time politically that is incredibly partisan. It is hard to break through any messaging, and it was an incumbency as well," Jean-Pierre said.</p><p>Earlier that day, Jean-Pierre defended Biden’s mental acuity on "CBS Mornings," despite several behind-the-scenes reports about the former president’s decline in health while in office.</p><p>"I saw someone who was always engaged. I saw someone who understood policy, pushed us on the policy, and also understood history," Jean-Pierre said.</p><p>As press secretary, Jean-Pierre repeatedly defended Biden’s mental health, even after his disastrous June 2024 presidential debate.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>After seven months away from the Philadelphia Eagles, Brandon Graham has the itch to play again. </p><p>Graham, who spent all 15 years of his NFL career with the Eagles, is tacking another one on as he is finalizing a deal to rejoin his old squad, according to multiple reports. The Eagles are expected to make the move official on Wednesday. </p><p>Graham, a two-time Super Bowl champion in Philadelphia, was the longest-tenured player in Eagles history when he retired following the team’s Super Bowl LIX win over the Kansas City Chiefs. </p><p>But, with the Eagles facing some depth issues on their defensive line, especially with Za’Darius Smith surprisingly announcing his own retirement midway through the year, Philadelphia is calling on an old friend to help them out. </p><p>The Eagles have just 11 sacks through seven games, which is toward the bottom of the league. Graham totaled 76.5 sacks over his career and 487 combined tackles through 206 regular-season games. He tallied 126 tackles for loss and 153 quarterback hits over his record-setting game total. </p><p>Graham not only brings the experience, but also the natural leadership experience to a franchise where he is adored. </p><p>While Smith is retired, the Eagles have seen Nolan Smith placed on the injured reserve, while Jalen Carter missed a good amount of time due to injury. Azeez Ojulari is also dealing with a knee injury. </p><p>Graham said that he would answer some questions on his "Brandon Graham Unlocked" podcast, which one would believe includes the thinking behind his decision to return. </p><p>While it was a Super Bowl-winning final season for Graham at the time, he tore his triceps which rendered him unable to play until the Super Bowl. He had 20 tackles and 3.5 sacks through 11 regular-season games before his injury last season. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Singer Kenny Loggins denounces Trump's 'No Kings' post using his iconic 'Top Gun' song</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Singer Kenny Loggins demanded that his song be removed from a meme President Donald Trump posted on Saturday.</p><p>In a statement shared with Variety on Monday, the musician slammed Trump for using his "Danger Zone" track in an A.I.-generated post in which Trump dumped fecal matter on "No Kings" protesters from an F-18 fighter jet. </p><p>"This is an unauthorized use of my performance of ‘Danger Zone.’ Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately," Loggins said.</p><p>Trump’s meme served as a response to the "No Kings" demonstrations that occurred in multiple U.S. cities on Saturday, protesting the Trump administration’s agenda — including its federal crackdown on immigration and crime in U.S. cities.</p><p>In the A.I. video, a crown-wearing Trump flew an F-18 over "No Kings" demonstrators and dumped fecal matter onto them from the plane. In one shot from the clip, a protester — believed to be young progressive activist Harry Sisson — bore the full brunt of Trump’s payload.</p><p>Loggins’ song made famous by the movie, "Top Gun," played throughout the clip. The artist lamented that his song had become part of what he described as a divisive post.</p><p>"I can’t imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us. Too many people are trying to tear us apart, and we need to find new ways to come together," he said. "We’re all Americans, and we’re all patriotic. There is no ‘us and them’ — that’s not who we are, nor is it what we should be. It’s all of us. We’re in this together, and it is my hope that we can embrace music as a way of celebrating and uniting each and every one of us."</p><p>Sisson also commented on Trump’s meme, posting on X on Sunday: "Can a reporter please ask Trump why he posted an AI video of himself dropping poop on me from a fighter jet? That would be great, thanks."</p><p>Vice President JD Vance replied to the left-wing influencer, stating, "I’ll ask him for you Harry."</p><p>The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Keith Urban appeared to have Nicole Kidman on his mind months before their separation.</p><p>Urban, 57, returned to television screens Sunday for the premiere of "The Road," a reality television show that follows a dozen up-and-coming musicians competing for a chance to open for the musician as he tours the country.</p><p>During the series premiere, Urban performed "Straight Line" from his latest album, "High." The song kicks off Urban's 12th studio album – which was released in September 2024 – and reflects on the desire to break free from a "soul-sucking routine," he explained on Instagram last year.</p><p>"I chose it first for a lot of reasons, but particularly because I think it represents an energy and spirit that became a through line of the whole record," Urban told social media followers in February 2024. "I’m gonna cover a lot of themes, emotions and vibes on this album but a very human spirit runs through them all."</p><p>He noted that "'Straight Line' is wanting to break out of a soul-sucking routine that you might be stuck in: maybe in a relationship, a job, with creativity, with yourself...whatever it is !! It’s a message of feeling alive again and getting out from under that dark cloud."</p><p>While the episode was filmed before Kidman filed for divorce from the "Somebody Like You" singer in September, Urban discussed feeling "lonely and miserable" while on the road.</p><p>"Where do we start? It’s a calling, and you’re going to do it or you’re not going to make it," Urban said. </p><p>"When you wake up on a tour bus at 3:30 in the morning and you’re sick as a dog, you’re in the middle of nowhere and you’ve got to play your fifth show later that night, and you haven’t slept, and you miss your friends, and you’re missing your family, and you’re completely lonely and miserable and sick – and you say to yourself, ‘Why am I doing this?'"</p><p>The Grammy Award-winning artist confessed, "The only answer can be: because this is what I’m born to do. We’re going to find out who’s made for that stuff [on this show]."</p><p>Kidman, 58, and Urban were last publicly seen together in June at a FIFA Club World Cup match in Nashville between Los Angeles Football Club and Esperance de Tunis. </p><p>The "Big Little Lies" actress filed for divorce in September on the grounds of "irreconcilable differences", while also noting "marital difficulties" in documents obtained by Fox News Digital. </p><p>In Kidman's divorce filing, the Oscar-winner requested to be named the primary residential parent of their two minor children. </p><p>Additionally, she petitioned the court to approve a parenting plan for their daughters, which allocated 306 days per year with her and 59 days each year with Urban.</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>With over 500,000 illegal aliens deported since President Donald Trump took office in January, the administration is on track to significantly exceed the record number of illegals deported out of the United States.</p><p>Since Trump’s return to the Oval Office on Jan. 20, the administration has deported over 515,000 illegal aliens, according to a high-ranking official at the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital the administration is "on pace to shatter historic records" by deporting 600,000 illegals by the end of Trump’s first year back in office. She said that in total, more than two million illegal aliens have left the U.S., including 1.6 million who voluntarily self-deported, as well as the over 515,000 deportations. Another 485,000 illegal aliens have been arrested by DHS since Trump took office.</p><p>McLaughlin said that "this is just the beginning" and that Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem "have jumpstarted an agency that was vilified and barred from doing its job for the last four years."</p><p>"Illegal aliens are hearing our message to leave now or face the consequence. Migrants are now even turning back before they reach our borders," said McLaughlin, pointing to what she said has been a 99.99 percent drop in migration through Panama’s Darien Gap, which is a key migration route to the U.S.</p><p>"In the face of a historic number of injunctions from activist judges, ICE, CBP, and the U.S. Coast Guard have made historic progress to carry out President Trump’s promise of arresting and deporting illegal aliens who have invaded our country."</p><p>Just this weekend, DHS said that it continued its sweep of the "worst of the worst" criminal illegal aliens across the country amidst the ongoing government shutdown. Over the weekend, DHS said it arrested illegals convicted of rape of a child, assault, hit-and-run, kidnapping and other crimes.</p><p>One of those arrested was Erick Xavier Romero, a Dominican national, who the agency said was convicted of rape of a child in Boston. Another illegal, Guatemalan national, German Osvaldo Cortez-Chajon, was arrested this weekend after being convicted of traveling to meet a child for an unlawful sex act in Dale County, Alabama. A third illegal, Mexican national Graciano Lopez-Flores, was arrested following a conviction of indecent liberties with a child in Orange County, North Carolina.</p><p>Also in North Carolina, ICE arrested Shahed Hassan, an illegal from Bangladesh, who was convicted of simple assault, possession of drug paraphernalia, illegally carrying a concealed gun, driving while impaired, probation violation, felony larceny and domestic violence protection order violation in Wake County.</p><p>Just to the north, ICE arrested Van Pham from Laos, who was convicted of five counts of abduction and burglary in Fairfax County, Virginia.</p><p>In Massachusetts, ICE arrested Patricia Pimental-Cordero, from the Dominican Republic, who was convicted of two counts of hit-and-run in Lawrence, Massachusetts.</p><p>Another illegal, Ramona Mercado-Vasquez from the Caribbean island of Dominica, was arrested by ICE in Bergen County, New Jersey, following a conviction for kidnapping and robbery.</p><p>In Wisconsin, ICE arrested Mexican national Karlett Zagal-Salazar, who was convicted of drug trafficking.</p><p>Commenting on the arrests, McLaughlin told Fox News Digital that "nothing—not even a government shutdown—will slow us down from making America safe again."</p><p>She slammed the Democratic Party, saying, "While Democrats in Congress continue to keep the government shutdown, our ICE law enforcement officers aren’t slowing down in arresting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Podcaster Joe Rogan and comedian Andrew Schulz blasted former Vice President Kamala Harris’ recent book tour, arguing it is an ironic boon to President Donald Trump.</p><p>Harris joined liberal journalist Kara Swisher at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., to discuss her new book, "107 Days," which details her whirlwind experience in the 2024 election. During the interview, Harris touted her own credentials, comparing them to those of the Trump administration and said, "Some people have actually said I was the most qualified candidate ever to run for president." </p><p>"I like the ‘some people say,’ very nice, but go ahead," Swisher joked in response.</p><p>The phrases "some people say" and "many people are saying" are often considered to be some of Trump’s common phrases typically used before he touts the accomplishments of himself and his administration.</p><p>"She was on stage with Kara Swisher, and Kara Swisher was kind of like ragging on her a little bit. She was like, 'Uh, you know, uh, a lot of — some people said that I was the most qualified person to ever run for president' Like, who said that? And Kara's like, 'Some people said that?' Like, who said that?" Rogan said. "You are literally running against a guy who was already president. So, if you're going based on your resume, you're not more qualified than Biden. Biden was the vice president of the United States for eight years!"</p><p>Schulz responded on how the GOP is using Harris' book tout to show why she lost the election. </p><p>"When she went away for a while, I think you could be like, you could pretend about what she was and what she stood for," Schulz said before highlighting how on her book tour she ignited controversy about why she couldn't pick Pete Buttigieg as her running mate. </p><p>Rogan pointed to a 2021 Harris' Columbus Day message that recently resurfaced. Harris said at the time that the U.S. "must not shy away" from its "shameful past" of European explorers who she said ushered "in a wave of devastation for tribal nations."</p><p>"Did you see her Columbus Day message to America?" he asked. "Oh God. It was like, 'Don't forget the horrors that the Europeans did to the — OK. Jesus Christ. Scolding!"</p><p>Rogan went on to mock how the same people talking about land acknowledgments also push globalism and joked, "Columbus is the only immigrant they hate."</p><p>Harris' office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Florida Gators football is in search of a new head coach after the school fired Billy Napier on Sunday following an error-filled victory over the Mississippi State Bulldogs.</p><p>Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III floated a big name that the Gators might want to consider as their next head coach: Tim Tebow.</p><p>"I’ve said this for years now. I think they should hire Tim Tebow," Griffin said Monday on "The Dan Patrick Show." "I think they should hire Tim Tebow. If Tim Tebow goes into any home in Florida, you’re telling me that those parents aren’t saying, ‘Yep, sign me up. I’m coming.’ You gotta put a great staff around him."</p><p>Patrick and Griffin debated the notion of hiring an iconic athlete like Tebow as their head coach as it didn’t exactly turn out great in college basketball for Georgetown and Patrick Ewing and St. John’s and Chris Mullin. However, it did work out for Florida when the team hired Steve Spurrier to be its head coach before the 1990 season.</p><p>Tebow hasn’t exactly expressed interest in coaching. He’s been on the front lines of the effort to stop human trafficking when he’s not analyzing the current state of college football during the season.</p><p>Florida athletic director Scott Stricklin vowed to be thorough in his efforts to find the next head coach.</p><p>The Gators have never appeared in the College Football Playoff.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>While President Donald Trump and his administration brushed off the "No Kings" nationwide protests rebuking the president over the weekend, Democrats lauded the protesters for standing up for democracy. </p><p>The protest marked at least the second time "No Kings" rallies have been organized across the country in major cities, including Washington, New York City and Los Angeles, since Trump took office for the second time, and organizers claim the protests are in opposition to his authoritarian policies. </p><p>Meanwhile, Trump pushed back on the description of "king," as he and other Republicans poked fun at the millions participating in the rallies. </p><p>"I’m not a king," Trump told reporters Sunday on Air Force One. "I work my ass off to make our country great. That’s all it is. I’m not a king at all."</p><p>Trump also characterized the protests as inconsequential, and said that those who participated didn’t accurately reflect the people who make up the U.S. </p><p>"The demonstrations were very small, very ineffective and the people were whacked out," Trump said Sunday. "When you look at those people, those are not representative of the people of our country."</p><p>Despite Trump’s rejection of being labeled a king, the official White House social media accounts previously posted an image in February of Trump wearing a crown with a caption claiming "long live the king." Trump also reposted an AI-generated video that Vice President JD Vance originally shared, depicting Trump placing a crown on his head and drawing a sword. </p><p>Additionally, Trump shared another AI-generated video of him donning a crown in a fighter jet over New York City, unloading what appeared to be feces on the protesters. </p><p>Meanwhile, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., said that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. needed a distraction from the government shutdown that started Oct. 1, although Johnson did admit that the protests turned out to be a "violent-free, free speech exercise." </p><p>"They needed a stunt," Johnson said in an interview with ABC Sunday. "They needed a show. Chuck Schumer has — needs cover right now. He’s closed the government down because he needs political cover, and this was a part of it."</p><p>However, Democrats said the protests were an opportunity to stand up for democracy. For example, Schumer said that there are "no dictators" in the U.S., and that "we won’t allow Trump to keep eroding our democracy." </p><p>"Dictators evolve when good people of all different beliefs and backgrounds stay silent," Schumer said in a social media post on Saturday. "This No Kings Day says we will not stay silent."</p><p>Additionally, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi shared a video clip of her dismantling a plastic crown, appearing to harken back to when she ripped Trump’s State of the Union address in 2020. </p><p>"We’re gonna tear up the crown!" Pelosi said in the brief clip, which she shared on social media with the caption: "No crown. #NoKings!" </p><p>Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also weighed in, claiming "we said ‘hell no’ to kings, and reminded the nation and the world what patriotism looks like." </p><p>"From our nation's capitol to cities across California, millions stood shoulder to shoulder to say that our democracy is worth fighting for, that our voices will not be silent, and that we will not sit back and let a wannabe king take our freedoms," Schiff said Saturday to accompany several photos of himself at the protest in Washington. "Proud to stand with you." </p><p>Additionally, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said the protests were reflective of the democratic process in the U.S. </p><p>"This is what democracy looks like!" Murray said in a Saturday social media post. "We use our voices and our votes. NO KINGS IN AMERICA!"</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Stephen A. Smith still thinks about the LeBron James courtside confrontation, and he told one former NBA star why he felt he was "set up" by the league’s all-time scoring leader in that moment. </p><p>Smith and James went viral earlier this year during a Los Angeles Lakers game, where the latter confronted the former in his courtside seat to seemingly address Smith’s criticism of how the Lakers were handling Bronny James, the superstar’s son. </p><p>Smith revealed in March that the incident stemmed from his televised critiques of Bronny. </p><p>"That wasn’t a basketball player confronting me. That was a parent. That was a father," Smith said on ESPN at the time. "I can’t sit here and be angry or feel slighted by LeBron James in that regard. By all accounts, he’s obviously a wonderful family man and father who cares very, very deeply about his son.</p><p>During a recent episode of "7PM In Brooklyn with Carmelo Anthony," Smith revisited the moment with the New York Knicks legend, saying that the circumstances of the conversation with James as well as how it appeared on camera still doesn’t sit right with him. </p><p>"The day that he rolled up on me courtside, it was the day my contract was announced that I had stayed with ESPN," Smith explained on the podcast. "Go back and look at the camera angle…This is 2025, we got technology everywhere. TNT is a nationally televised game. How is it we got one angle, and the only angle you see was of him and his face, but you see the back of my peanut head?"</p><p>Smith believes that, considering James’ star status, there would’ve been many more camera angles of the courtside meeting. </p><p>"There’s no way that you’re in an arena, you’re LeBron James, and the only angle that somebody sees is a straight up shot of you getting in my face," Smith added. "They see no reaction. They see nothing. And that’s an accident?"</p><p>Smith delved into the conspiracy realm here, but he stood his ground as he expressed his feelings about it potentially being an orchestrated confrontation. </p><p>"Damn right I did," Smith quickly responded to a question of whether he felt set up or not. "That’s how I feel. But no big deal, no problem because I go on the air the next day and I’m like, ‘That’s a dad reacting to his son.’"</p><p>And in case you’re wondering, no, Smith and James have not made up. In fact, Smith said it plainly how he feels about James. </p><p>"I don’t like his a--, not a little bit," he said. "This dates back more than a decade. I’m not gonna go into detail at the stuff this man has tried to do to me. You do not understand the lengths this man would go to… If it were up to him, I wouldn’t be where I am today. It’s some low, low stuff."</p><p>The beef is real between these two, and it doesn’t seem like there will be any patching it up heading into the 2025-26 season this week. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is expected to imminently weigh in on the New York City mayoral race after dodging the question for weeks.</p><p>The top House Democrat, who represents part of Brooklyn, has faced scrutiny in the press for repeatedly side-stepping reporters when asked whether he will endorse fellow Democrat Zohran Mamdani, a self-described Democratic Socialist, for mayor.</p><p>Asked during his Monday press conference whether he will make his thoughts on the race clear before early voting begins in New York City on Saturday, Oct. 25, Jeffries said, "Yes, that's my intention."</p><p>It could mean Jeffries endorses Mamdani before Election Day rolls around — or he could sidestep backing anyone in the race altogether.</p><p>The remark was similar to comments he gave Fox News Digital on Friday, the day after the mayoral debate. Jeffries said then, however, that he had not yet watched the debate at that point.</p><p>"I do expect to speak to the Democratic nominee, Zohran, at some point before early voting," he added when asked how long he was waiting to endorse.</p><p>He also dodged the question of why he has not yet endorsed Mamdani during an appearance on ABC News' "This Week" on Sunday.</p><p>"As I've indicated, I expect to have a conversation with him at some point this week in advance of early voting, which begins next weekend in New York City. And we'll certainly have more to say about the mayors' race and about our Democratic nominee prior to early voting beginning," Jeffries said instead.</p><p>Mamdani is currently the presumed frontrunner in the race against Republican Curtis Sliwa and Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York.</p><p>Jeffries' counterpart in the House, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has repeatedly denounced Mamdani as a "Marxist."</p><p>And Mamdani's candidacy has caused somewhat of a rift between Democrats in Washington.</p><p>He's been endorsed by progressive stars within the Democratic Party like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., but both Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have been silent.</p><p>Reps. Laura Gillen, D-N.Y., and Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., moderates representing the suburbs outside of New York City, have denounced Mamdani's candidacy.</p><p>Jeffries appears to have been deliberately unclear about his moves, but Republicans have accused him and Schumer of prolonging the current government shutdown over fear of a progressive revolt led by New York Democrats like Mamdani.</p><p>Jeffries made his brief remarks on Monday during a press conference on day 20 of the shutdown, with Republicans and Democrats appearing no closer to an agreement on a path forward.</p><p>At another point in the press conference, Jeffries demanded that President Donald Trump take a more active role in negotiations on ending the shutdown.</p><p>"Donald Trump definitively needs to get involved. He needs to get off the sidelines, get off the golf course and actually decide to end the shutdown that he's created, that he has allowed to happen," Jeffries said.</p><p>"We know that House and Senate Republicans don't do anything without getting permission from their boss, Donald J. Trump, and the reason why there have been no negotiations, zero negotiations, since Republicans shut the government."</p><p>But Republican leaders in Congress have repeatedly insisted that they have nothing to negotiate after offering a straightforward, seven-week extension of fiscal year (FY) 2025 federal funding levels. </p><p>The measure, called a continuing resolution (CR), is aimed at giving congressional appropriators more time to strike a longer-term deal on FY2026 funding.</p><p>The House passed the bill on Sept. 19. But in the Senate, where at least eight Democrats are needed to break a filibuster if all GOP lawmakers supported it, the bill has failed to advance twelve times.</p><p>Democratic leaders are demanding any funding bill be paired with an extension of COVID-19 pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of this year.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A hobbyist's keen eye led authorities to a human skull on the bank of an Indiana river — a find that turned out to be over 4,000 years old.</p><p>The Fayette County Coroner's Office announced the discovery in an Oct. 9 press release.</p><p>The skull, which was reported to authorities on June 2, was uncovered near the West Fork of the Whitewater River, which flows through Indiana's historic Whitewater Valley.</p><p>A hobbyist, described as a local landowner, spotted the skull on an eroded bank. Authorities said that the finder was an "avid collector of Native American artifacts."</p><p>The Fayette County Sheriff’s Department began the initial investigation and quickly concluded that the skull was human. But its age took longer to confirm. </p><p>Samples of the skull were sent out to the University of Indianapolis Human Identification Center and the Center for Applied Isotope Studies at the University of Georgia for forensic and radiocarbon analyses, respectively.</p><p>After months of tests, officials can now say that the skull is around 4,270 years old. It likely belonged to a Native American who lived around 2300 B.C.</p><p>"Due to the discovery's antiquity and location near a waterway, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) was advised early in the investigation and has been formally notified of the radiocarbon results," the release concluded. </p><p>"The coroner's office is now awaiting guidance from the Indiana DNR regarding the next steps for repatriation and site management."</p><p>Eddie Richardson, coroner of Fayette County, told Fox News Digital on Monday that the tribal affiliation of the decedent is unknown at this time. Officials are currently working with an archaeologist from the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma to help identify the skull.</p><p>"The remains could belong to an individual associated with any number of tribes, including the Shawnee, Potawatomi, Delaware, or Cherokee, among others," said Richardson. </p><p>He added, "Unfortunately, our efforts are temporarily on hold due to the ongoing government shutdown, as compliance requires coordination with federal personnel who are currently furloughed."</p><p>In a previous statement, Richardson said that the discovery "underscores the importance of our community's vigilance and the necessity of professional collaboration."</p><p>"The preservation of historical and cultural heritage is a responsibility shared by all, and we are committed to handling this matter with the respect and diligence it deserves," he said.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Two teenagers, Lawrence Cotton Powell, 19, and Anthony Taylor, 18, who are linked to the beating of former DOGE staffer Edward Coristine in Washington, D.C., are now facing federal charges for a series of assaults and attempted carjacking.</p><p>The teens are charged with two counts of first-degree robbery and assault with intent to commit robbery, each of which is punishable by up to 15 years in prison, and attempted carjacking, which holds a penalty of up to five years.</p><p>U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeannine Pirro announced the charges in a press conference on Monday.</p><p>Pirro said the charges highlight "the need for accountability of offenders in the district."</p><p>"What’s significant about this case is the history of Lawrence Cotton Powell," she said.</p><p>Pirro said that despite being a repeat offender and already having a criminal history involving assault, Powell had been let off by D.C. judges shortly before he beat and robbed Coristine. She said that despite the U.S. Attorney’s office requesting jail time for Powell, his sentence was suspended by a local judge on July 25, just days before he attacked Coristine.</p><p>"After a felony of attempted robbery conviction, after a violation of probation, after a second crime, after a second conviction, after no compliance with CSOSA [Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency], the judges say, ‘Do better,’ and they let him go. And guess what? Within ten days, he’s at it again," said Pirro.</p><p>According to Pirro, Powell and Taylor, with a gang of several others, assaulted and robbed another individual just minutes before attacking Coristine. Pirro said that upon seeing the gang of approximately ten suspects approaching, Coristine pushed a female friend into her car in an attempt to keep her safe.</p><p>"He was then attacked by multiple suspects who then punched him repeatedly, causing significant injuries to him. They got him on the ground, and as they were doing so, they demanded the car from the woman who was inside the car and had already locked the car. They were banging on the car, they were pulling on the car door, trying to get the car open, and were telling the woman in the car to hand over the keys," said Pirro.</p><p>Pirro urged the D.C. City Council to "reconsider" its laws that "allow these young people to go out and victimize, revictimize and keep revictimizing and putting the safety of the citizens who live, work and visit here at risk." </p><p>"I ask them to stand up finally and send a clear message, because the people of this district deserve no less than safety," said Pirro. </p><p>Coristine was assaulted at approximately 3 a.m. by a group of teenagers in D.C.’s Logan Circle neighborhood.</p><p>A photo of a bloodied Coristine went viral, sparking outrage over the city’s handling of crime and drawing President Donald Trump’s attention. The president slammed D.C., saying crime in the city was "totally out of control."</p><p>"Local ‘youths’ and gang members, some only 14, 15, and 16-years-old, are randomly attacking, mugging, maiming, and shooting innocent citizens, at the same time knowing that they will be almost immediately released. They are not afraid of Law Enforcement because they know nothing ever happens to them, but it’s going to happen now!" Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p><p>Days later, Trump directed federal law enforcement to increase its presence throughout D.C. He also deployed members of the National Guard to patrol the city and assumed federal control of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump announced on Monday that construction has begun on a new, privately funded White House Ballroom – a long-envisioned addition designed to host state visits and large gatherings – as part of a modernization of the East Wing.</p><p>"I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom," Trump said on Truth Social. "Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernized as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete!</p><p>"For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc. I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway — with zero cost to the American Taxpayer!" he continued. "The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly. This Ballroom will be happily used for Generations to come!"</p><p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing in July that the construction of the estimated $200 million new ballroom would begin in September and be "completed long before the end of President Trump’s term."</p><p>Her announcement came after a similar gesture earlier this year, when Trump personally financed the installation of two 88-foot American flags flanking the White House, each reportedly costing about $50,000.</p><p>"The White House is currently unable to host major functions honoring world leaders in other countries without having to install a large and unsightly tent approximately 100 yards away from the main building's entrance," Leavitt said at the time, adding the new ballroom will be "a much needed and exquisite addition."</p><p>She also said the United States Secret Service will provide the necessary security enhancements and modifications during the construction.</p><p>The project is intended to provide a dedicated space for hosting official events, state dinners and large ceremonial gatherings.</p><p>The new 90,000-square-foot addition will accommodate approximately 650 seated guests and will stay true to the classical design of the White House.</p><p>The White House does not have a formal ballroom, and the new ballroom will take the place of the current East Wing of the White House.</p><p>Trump chose McCrery Architects to design the project, with Clark Construction overseeing the build and AECOM providing engineering support.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Amanda Macias contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Senate Dems emboldened by weekend rallies block GOP plan to end shutdown for 11th time</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Senate Democrats, fresh off a weekend of anti-Trump rallies, again blocked the Republicans' plan to reopen the government for an 11th time as the shutdown nears its fourth week.</p><p>Senate Republicans had hoped their colleagues across the aisle would have a change of heart after the "No Kings" rallies across the country, but like many times before, Senate Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., largely voted to block the funding bill.</p><p>Neither side has changed its position as the shutdown has continued to drag on.</p><p>Senate Democrats want an extension to expiring Obamacare subsidies, which were enhanced when Senate Democrats controlled the upper chamber under President Joe Biden and are set to expire by the end of this year.</p><p>Schumer accused congressional Republicans of being unwilling to solve the problem, despite overtures from Senate Republicans that they'd be open to have a vote on the matter. </p><p>"What kind of country do we live in? What kind of party is this Republican Party that is unwilling to solve this problem, which is staring Americans in the face, frightening Americans from one end of the country to the other," Schumer said. "And yet Republicans, what are they doing about it? Nothing. They're on vacation. It's unacceptable and morally repugnant."</p><p>Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., contended over the weekend at the "No Kings" rally in Washington, D.C., that when Democrats were in charge, the government never shut down.</p><p>"The government is shut down and shutdowns are painful," he said. "They hurt people. And frankly, that's why there was not a single government shutdown when Joe Biden was president and Democrats were in charge of Congress. Because we acted like adults, we negotiated with Republicans. We found common ground. We kept the government open."</p><p>But Senate Republicans have remained adamant that they won’t negotiate while the government is shut down. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., extended an olive branch to Senate Democrats and offered a vote on the expiring subsidies, but so far, Senate Democrats have not agreed.</p><p>Republicans are also trying to fund the government through other means. Thune tried and failed to advance the annual defense appropriations bill through a procedural hurdle last week, which Senate Democrats blocked. Republicans are also trying to finish work on a trio of funding bills passed in August, but Senate Democrats are blocking that, too.</p><p>"Any idea that this is about Obamacare enhanced premium tax credits is going by the wayside when they continue to keep the government shut down and don't allow us time to actually work on the issue," Thune said. "I don't think they want a solution. I think they want a political issue."</p><p>Another issue is that even if lawmakers were to pass the House-passed continuing resolution (CR) on Tuesday, Congress would only have one month to finish work on spending bills to fund the government. When asked if the it was time to think about the House coming back to extend the deadline, Thune said, "For sure." </p><p>"I mean, every day that passes, we have less time to fund the government," he said. </p><p>Meanwhile, lawmakers will get the chance to pay certain federal workers and the military later in the week.</p><p>Thune said that he planned to tee up legislation from Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and several other Senate Republicans that would pay military service members and certain "excepted" federal workers who are still working despite the ongoing shutdown. That bill could be ready for a vote by Thursday at the latest. </p><p>When asked if he worried that Senate Democrats would continue to take hostages during the shutdown fight, Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said, "Hopefully not."</p><p>"Because at whatever point the Schumer shutdown ends is because the Democrats are finally tired of it, or they hear enough from their constituents," he said. "Hopefully enough people will tell them, ‘Hey, we don't want that anymore. You keep government open. Do the job.’"</p><p>But for now, there’s no real end in sight for the shutdown.</p><p>Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, contended that neither side would break the impasse given that there’s no "incentive" to do so.</p><p>"What we're seeing is different," Murkowski said. "You've got both sides that are just really hard dug in, but everybody thinks they're winning. Nobody is winning when everybody's losing. And that's what's happening right now. The American public is losing."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">New court filings reveal who the DOJ alleges Comey authorized to leak info</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A new court filing by James Comey's attorneys definitively answers a lingering question about the criminal charges against the former FBI director: Who is "Person 3"?</p><p><span class="link">The Department of Justice last month charged</span> Comey with lying during a 2020 Senate hearing. The two-page indictment accuses the former FBI director of falsely telling lawmakers that he never gave anybody at the FBI permission to serve as an anonymous source in news reports about the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton. But it doesn't name the FBI staffer whom Comey allegedly authorized to leak, referring to them only as "Person 3."</p><p>In a <span class="link">motion filed Monday to dismiss the charges</span>, Comey's lawyers wrote that last week, the government "confirmed to the defense that … Person 3 refers to Daniel Richman."</p><p>Richman, a longtime friend of Comey, is a Columbia University law professor and former federal prosecutor in New York. He <span class="link">served at one point as</span> a "special government employee" at the FBI when Comey led the bureau.</p><p>It's still unclear what information Richman is accused of leaking. The Justice Department has not charged Richman with a crime or accused him of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Monday's filing — which argues Comey is the victim of a vindictive prosecution driven by President Trump's "personal animus" toward him — marks the first time that court papers have named the person the Justice Department believes Comey authorized to leak. Several media outlets had previously reported that Richman was "Person 3."</p><p>Richman's name did not come up in the Senate testimony that led to Comey's charges.</p><p>Instead, the indictment focuses on a testy back-and-forth in 2020, when Republican Sen. Ted Cruz grilled Comey about whether he let a different person — former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe — leak information about the Clinton probe to the Wall Street Journal. McCabe says he told Comey after the article came out that he authorized the leak, and Comey approved of it, but Comey has long insisted that no such conversation took place.</p><p>Comey had previously told Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley <span class="link">at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in 2017</span> that he never authorized anyone to serve as an anonymous source in media coverage on the FBI's investigations into Clinton or Mr. Trump. Three years later, Cruz argued McCabe's statements about the Wall Street Journal leak contradicted that.</p>
<p>"Now, what Mr. McCabe is saying and what you testified to this committee cannot both be true. One or the other is false," Cruz said to Comey in 2020. "Who's telling the truth?"</p><p>"I can only speak to my testimony. I stand by the testimony," replied Comey.</p><p>In Monday's filing, Comey's attorneys cast the fact that Cruz didn't ask about Richman as a fatal flaw in the government's case against the ex-FBI chief, who was charged with one count of making false statements to Congress and one count of obstructing a congressional investigation.</p><p>The lawyers wrote: "the indictment omits Senator Cruz's words that explicitly narrow the focus of his questions to Mr. McCabe and misleadingly implies that the questioning related to Mr. Richman."</p><p>"In other words, the indictment presents an inaccurate description of the testimony at the heart of this case," the court filing continued.</p><p>His attorneys also argue the Justice Department's charges misquote Comey. The indictment says Comey falsely stated to the Senate that he hadn't "authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports" — but that exact phrase was actually used by Cruz and Grassley, not Comey. And the filing notes that Cruz used the phrase "Clinton administration," not "Clinton investigation."</p><p>The filing says Comey is planning on asking for his false statement count to be dismissed "based on a defense of literal truth." It referenced the Supreme Court case Bronston v. United States, which said people who make literally true statements under oath aren't guilty of perjury.</p>
<p>CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department, Comey's attorneys and Richman for comment.</p><h2>What is Daniel Richman accused of doing?</h2><p>The indictment doesn't say what information the Justice Department believes Richman leaked to the media. It states only that Comey "authorized PERSON 3 to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding an FBI investigation concerning PERSON 1." </p><p>Comey's lawyers confirmed in Monday's filing that "Person 1" referred to Clinton.</p><p>The filing points to one FBI leak investigation involving Comey and Richman called "Arctic Haze," which was detailed in a memo declassified by the bureau earlier this year. Arctic Haze sought to figure out how classified details on the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server made their way into a 2017 New York Times article, which looked at Comey's decision-making while leading the politically fraught probe.</p><p>Richman was interviewed as part of Arctic Haze, according to the heavily redacted memo, which was published by the conservative-leaning site Just The News. The memo says Richman told FBI agents he had spoken with one of the authors of the Times article, but he didn't know how the reporter got a hold of the classified information, and Richman said he was "sure 'with a discount'" that he didn't tell the reporter himself.</p><p>The memo describes Richman as Comey's "liaison to the media," but also notes at one point: "Richman later told the interviewing agents Comey never asked him to talk to the media."</p><p>The Arctic Haze investigation closed without any charges. The memo said the probe "has not yielded sufficient evidence to criminally charge any person, including Comey or Richman, with making false statements or with the substantive offenses under investigation."</p>
<p>Separately, during the first Trump term, Comey was <span class="link">investigated by the Justice Department's inspector general</span> for giving memos about his conversations with Mr. Trump to Richman, who then provided their contents to a Times reporter. The internal watchdog found that Comey "violated applicable policies" but did not release any classified information.</p><p>Mr. Trump has <span class="link">accused Comey</span> of leaks and other nefarious conduct for almost a decade, stretching back to when he fired Comey as FBI director in 2017. The president has long criticized how Comey handled the FBI's probes into Clinton and the Trump campaign. Comey, for his part, has <span class="link">called</span> Mr. Trump "morally unfit to be president."</p><p>In Monday's court papers, Comey's lawyers asserted that Mr. Trump's longstanding "personal spite" led to the charges against him, which were filed shortly before the statute of limitations expired. </p><p>"No reasonable prosecutor would have brought such a deficient case; the only explanation is that the President's handpicked interim U.S. Attorney did so to carry out the President's wishes," they wrote in a 51-page filing, which also included a 60-page attachment listing all of the verbal barbs flung between Comey and Mr. Trump over the years.</p>

<div class="article-title">ICE official defends agency's tactics amid fallout from raid on wrong home</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>In footage shared widely on social media last week, <span class="link">federal immigration agents</span> were seen breaking into Gloria Magaña's home <span class="link">Portland, Oregon</span>, even though the person they were looking for does not live there.</p><p>The agents forced their way into the home without showing a warrant, Magaña told CBS News. </p><p>The raid occurred on Oct. 15. Magaña, a native of Mexico, said she got a call from her children, who told her the agents were shouting for someone named Israel, but nobody in their home goes by that name. She said she told her children to lock themselves inside a room.</p><p>With guns drawn, agents broke open the room's door. Magaña's daughter took a video of the heavily-armed agents telling them to put their hands up as her daughter, a three-month-old baby, cried. One of the agents asked if any of the men inside the room were named Israel.</p><p>Outside of the home, witnesses asked the federal officers for information.</p>
<p>"Stop watching TikTok. We don't have to identify ourselves to you," one agent was heard saying on video recorded by a witness.</p><p>While federal officials have since admitted they were looking for someone else, agents still detained Magaña's 20-year-old son and her partner, saying they were in the U.S. illegally. Magaña said neither has a criminal record. Federal records reviewed by CBS News also indicate the men do not have any criminal charges or convictions.</p><p>ICE's online detainee system indicated on Monday that Magaña's son, Napoleon Magaña, was being held at the agency's detention facility in Tacoma, Washington. Her partner, Arturo Garcia Cabrera, was transferred to the Adams County Correctional Center in Mississippi, the system showed.</p><p>A senior Homeland Security official told CBS News the federal agents who entered Magaña's home on Oct. 15 were looking for an individual with a criminal history who they say had evaded arrest and fled into the apartment complex. The target of the operation remains at large, the official said.</p>
<p>"Two other aliens from Mexico were found inside the apartment and taken into ICE custody at the scene," the official said, adding that no federal agents were hurt during the incident.</p><p>As millions took to the streets over the weekend for "No Kings" protests, federal agents in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered outside and ICE facility, where for months there have been demonstrations denouncing the agency's tactics as heavy-handed and indiscriminate.  </p><p>In an interview with CBS News in Portland, Marcos Charles, the head of ICE's deportation branch, Enforcement and Removal Operations, denied those charges.</p><p>"They're not indiscriminate," he told CBS News. "We do our surveillance. If you're in the country illegally, we're gonna arrest you."</p><p>Charles also downplayed concerns that ICE's tactics have become too aggressive.</p><p>"We use the force necessary to affect an arrest," he said. "If people interpret that as being aggressive, so be it."</p><p>Since President Trump took office again and launched a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration, ICE agents have been given a broad mandate to detain and deport those in the U.S. illegally, with Biden-era limits on arrests of non-criminals reversed.</p>
<p>Charles said ICE is still primarily targeting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who also have committed crimes. But he said anyone in the U.S. illegally who is found by his agents will be arrested, even if they lack a criminal record and have been in the country for 40 years.</p><p>On Monday, an appeals court said the Trump administration could <span class="link">deploy National Guard troops</span> to Portland to protect the ICE facility there while the legal battle over their deployment plays out.</p><p>Some in the local community are seeking to help those who could be targeted by immigration agents, including Pastor Mark Knutson, who has put up signs saying ICE agents need permission to enter his church.</p><p>"We're not gonna hide people. What we're gonna create is a space to be safe," explained Knutson, who is a reverend doctor at the Augustana Lutheran Church. "And then we work the systems to help them get their amnesty or get the documents."</p><p>"ICE cannot come in here … This could be a standoff if that happens," he added.</p><p>Knutson said he prays he never has to face that reality.</p>

<div class="article-title">Comey seeks to have indictment tossed for vindictive prosecution</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey filed a slate of motions Monday seeking to have the two-count federal indictment against him dismissed before a potential trial date early next year, arguing he was charged because of "President Trump's personal animus."</p><p>Comey's attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that it is based on a vindictive and unlawful prosecution. He is also challenging the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney <span class="link">Lindsey Halligan</span> to that role. </p><p>Comey's attorneys wrote that the charges arose due to an "egregious abuse of power," and there are "multiple glaring constitutional violations" in the indictment. They argued that Mr. Trump ordered prosecutors to charge Comey due to "personal spite" and because Comey had "frequently criticized the President," who fired Comey from his role leading the FBI in 2017 and has sparred with Comey for years.</p><p>The requests were expected, as Fitzgerald previewed them when he appeared alongside Comey during his arraignment earlier this month. He is expected to file a second tranche of filings to toss out the charges in the coming weeks.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff has set a hearing on the first set of motions for Nov. 19 in Alexandria, Virginia.</p>
<p>Comey's attorneys said that even if the case is not dismissed for vindictive prosecution, "concrete and objective facts justify thorough discovery into the suspect prosecutorial decision-making process that led to this flawed indictment and a hearing at which the government must justify its decision to bring these unfounded and retaliatory charges."</p><p>His legal team says that "absent a dismissal with prejudice, Mr. Comey would face a potential perpetual state of being vindictively prosecuted."</p><p>In a separate motion, attorneys for Comey also argued that Halligan, the only attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia to sign his indictment, "was defectively appointed to her office as an interim U.S. Attorney."</p><p>Arguing that "no properly appointed" official from the executive branch had obtained the indictment against Comey, his lawyers said "the indictment is equally a nullity" and should be dismissed.</p>
<p>"The President and Attorney General appointed the President's personal lawyer as interim U.S. Attorney in violation of a clear statutory command so that the interim U.S. Attorney could indict an outspoken critic of the President just days before the relevant statute of limitations was set to expire," Comey's lawyers wrote.</p>
<p>A Justice Department spokesperson had no comment on the pair of motions.</p><h2>Prosecutors raise doubts about Comey's attorney</h2><p>Federal prosecutors also indicated Sunday that they may seek to have Fitzgerald disqualified because of his alleged involvement in a so-called plan by Comey to leak the contents of a memo to the media shortly after Mr. Trump fired him as FBI director in 2017, during the president's first term.</p><p>"[B]ased on publicly disclosed information, the defendant used current lead defense counsel to improperly disclose classified information," prosecutors Tyler Lemons and Gabriel Diaz, wrote in a filing. "This fact raises a question of conflict and disqualification for current lead defense counsel."</p><p>A Department of Justice Inspector General report found that Comey shared four memos with Fitzgerald in May 2017, who then forwarded them to two other lawyers working for Comey. Prosecutors are asking Nachmanoff to put in place a "filter team" to sift through evidence that may contain information shielded by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be disclosed. </p><p>Prosecutors' use of material protected by privilege can raise obstacles in the case, ranging from disqualification of that material to mistrial or dismissal of charges. Filter teams are typically groups of government attorneys who review documents and separate privileged information from non-privileged information before the material gets to prosecutors on a given case.</p><p>Prosecutors said the evidence at issue in Comey's case includes communications between him and several lawyers, one of whom appears to be Fitzgerald. They wrote in their latest filing that the material subject to review by the filter team "could also inform a potential conflict and disqualification issue for" Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>But Comey's lawyers accused prosecutors of attempting to "defame" Fitzgerald and noted that the Justice Department's internal watchdog "found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the Memos to members of the media." The Justice Department in 2019 declined to prosecute Comey for his handling of the memos.</p><h2>Halligan is the latest DOJ prosecutor to face court challenges</h2><p>Comey was charged in September with one count of making false statements to Congress and one count of obstruction of justice, related to Senate testimony he gave five years ago. Comey pleaded not guilty to both counts at his arraignment.</p><p>Because Comey is challenging Halligan's appointment to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, Nachsmanoff, who sits on the bench in the district, will have to recuse himself, and a judge from outside of the district will hear arguments on that motion. </p><p>The challenge to Halligan's appointment comes after defendants in New Jersey and Nevada successfully challenged similar U.S. attorney appointments President Trump made in those two states in recent weeks, as the administration has attempted to bypass the Senate confirmation process for these positions around the country.</p><p>A federal judge in August found that Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, is serving "<span class="link">without lawful authority"</span> as the U.S. attorney in New Jersey. Weeks later, a federal judge ruled that Sigal Chattah, the top federal prosecutor in Nevada, <span class="link">was also serving illegally</span> in her role.</p><p>Halligan, one of Mr. Trump's former defense lawyers who later joined him in his second administration, <span class="link">was tapped as interim U.S. attorney</span> in September after serving as a senior aide to Mr. Trump in the White House. Her appointment came days after Erik Siebert, who had been the top federal prosecutor in Eastern Virginia, <span class="link">resigned amid concerns</span> he would be forced out for not prosecuting another of Mr. Trump's foe, New York Attorney General Letitia James, for alleged mortgage fraud. </p><p>James was <span class="link">indicted in the Eastern District of Virginia</span> earlier this month on one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. She has called the charges "baseless."</p>
<p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has invoked a provision of federal law that addresses U.S. attorney vacancies to install people in these posts temporarily. The law allows an appointee to serve 120 days as interim U.S. attorney and gives district court judges in the area the authority to keep them in the role or tap a new U.S. attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled.</p><p>In the case of the Eastern District of Virginia, Siebert was installed as the interim U.S. attorney in January, and the judges there had extended his appointment as U.S. attorney for the region in May.</p><p>But in the challenge to Habba's appointment to lead the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office earlier this year, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann found that the attorney general is given 120 total days to appoint an interim U.S. attorney. The judge agreed that the law allows different individuals to be appointed interim U.S. attorney, "but for an aggregate term of 120 days." </p><p>Allowing the 120-day clock to reset with the selection of each new temporary U.S. attorney would allow the president "to staff the United States Attorney's office with individuals of his personal choice for an entire term without seeking the Senate's advice and consent," Brann wrote.</p><p>While that conclusion does not bind the judge who will consider the validity of Halligan's appointment in Virginia, Fitzpatrick's motion points to Habba's case as part of the government's attempt to "end run" Congress' authority on judicial nominations and appointments, adding: "This Court should reject the government's machinations here."</p><h2>Comey charged after sparring with Trump for years</h2><p>Comey has long been a political opponent of Mr. Trump's, and the president has for years taken to social media to attack the former FBI director. Mr. Trump has lambasted Comey for his handling of the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and alleged ties between Russia and Mr. Trump's associates. Mr. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, and Robert Mueller, who was named special counsel just over a week after Comey's ouster, then took over the probe. </p><p>The indictment of the former FBI chief came days after Mr. Trump took to social media to voice frustration with Bondi for not bringing criminal charges against Comey and two other political opponents: James and California Sen. Adam Schiff, both Democrats.</p>
<p>In his message to Bondi, Mr. Trump called the trio "guilty as hell" and wrote, "We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!"</p><p>While claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are difficult to prevail on, former prosecutors have said the <span class="link">circumstances surrounding Comey's indictment</span> could be a boon to his lawyers in having the charges tossed out. </p><p>Selective prosecution is when the prosecutor appears motivated by discriminatory intent, and vindictive prosecution is when the government acts out of "genuine" animus or seeks to punish a defendant for exercising a legal right.</p><p>Fitzgerald said at Comey's arraignment that there will be another slate of motions filed by Nov. 20 also challenging the case against him, including claims of grand jury abuse and "outrageous conduct" by the Justice Department. </p><p>Grounds for a motion alleging abuse of the grand jury process can include possible improper legal instructions given by the prosecutor to the grand jury, an intentional withholding of information that would exonerate the defendant or indictments obtained as a means of retaliation.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Paris —</em> The Louvre will remain closed for a second day running on Monday, management told the Agence France-Presse, after thieves <span class="link">stole crown jewels</span> from the museum in Paris a day earlier.</p><p> "The museum is not opening today," a museum official told AFP.</p><p> A sign at the famed landmark told visitors the museum remained closed due to "exceptional circumstances" and said all visitors with tickets for the day would be reimbursed.</p><p> "The museum is closed for the whole day," a member of staff told visitors.</p><p> Shortly before the announcement, queues of impatient visitors snaked their way across the Louvre's pyramid courtyard and under the arches of the main entrance gallery.</p>
<p>Carol Fuchs, a tourist from the United States, had been standing in line for more than 45 minutes.</p>
<p> "The audacity, coming through a window. I feel so sorry for whoever was on guard in that room," she told AFP after the thieves escaped with prize jewels from the museum's Apollo Gallery on Sunday.</p><p> "Will they ever be found? I doubt it. I think it's long gone," she said.</p><p>Thieves carried out the brazen daytime heist on Sunday morning. They broke into the iconic landmark using a crane-type lift to force open a window before smashing through display cases and making off with jewelry of "inestimable value," according to France's interior minister and the museum. They escaped on motorcycles or scooters, officials said.</p><p>The robbery hit The Louvre's Galerie d'Apollon, a vaulted hall that displays  <span class="link">some of the French crown jewels</span> underneath a ceiling painted by King Louis  XIV's court artist, the ministry said.</p>
<p>It all happened in broad daylight, with tourists inside the world's most visited museum. There were no injuries reported.</p><p>French Culture Minister Rachida Dati called the robbery the work of "professionals," describing it on the TF1 TV network as "a four-minute operation carried out without violence."</p><p>CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer says many French have reacted with shock at the ease with which such treasured items could be so quickly and seemingly easily plucked from such a vaunted, highly secured institution.</p><p>She asked art historian David Chanteranne, who has worked in the Louvre, if the glass in the display cases holding the jewels would have been reinforced somehow?</p><p>"Incredibly it wasn't," he said, explaining that for the purposes of "historical accuracy," the Louvre had used the original cases to display the crown jewels, including glass from Napoleon's time, two centuries ago.</p>

<div class="article-title">States warn SNAP benefits may stop in November if shutdown continues</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.</p><p>"Starting October 16, SNAP  [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal <span class="link">government shutdown</span> ends and funds are released to PA," reads a notice from the Pennsylvania state website.</p><p>New Jersey, <span class="link">Maryland</span>, New York and Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.</p><p>The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be "insufficient funds" to pay full November SNAP benefits.</p><p>Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program. Advocates, meanwhile, have warned the effects could be devastating.</p>
<p>"These are, for the most part, working individuals who still are living paycheck to paycheck," said Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research &amp; Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger. </p><h2>How SNAP benefits are normally administered</h2><p>Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.</p><p>While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a "delicate partnership of public and private entities."</p><p>To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards. </p>
<p>"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time," Plata-Nino explained. "They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe."</p><p>The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors "until further notice." The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.</p><p>"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one," Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident and SNAP recipient, told CBS News.</p><h2>Contingency funding</h2><p>One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.</p><p>After Democrats and Republicans <span class="link">failed to come to an agreement</span> to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown. </p><p>"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year," the plan states. </p><p>However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on whether that option is under consideration. </p>
<p>During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, Plata-Nino said.</p><p>"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ..." Plata-Nino said. "They have the money, so it really is a policy choice."</p><p>It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.</p><p>Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states.</p>

<div class="article-title">Biden completes round of radiation therapy to treat aggressive prostate cancer</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Former President Joe Biden has completed a round of radiation therapy to treat an aggressive form of <span class="link">prostate cancer</span> — an encouraging sign of progress — but one that does not signal the end of his treatment.</p><p>A Biden spokeswoman confirmed to CBS News Monday that the former president, who turns 83 next month, finished several weeks of radiation therapy treatment Monday at Penn Medicine Radiation Oncology in Philadelphia. His office first announced Oct. 11 that the former president had been undergoing radiation treatment for prostate cancer for several weeks. </p><p>"He rang the bell today," Biden spokeswoman Kelly Scully said.</p><p>Ashley Biden, the daughter of the former president, posted on Instagram a quick video clip of her father ringing the bell, with the caption, "Rung the bell! Thank you to the incredible doctors, nurses, and staff at Penn Medicine. We are so grateful!"</p><p>Subsequent photos posted by the one-time first daughter show the former president posing with a medical professional, and another with former first lady Jill Biden and two of their grandchildren with the caption, "Dad has been so damn brave throughout his treatment. Grateful."</p>
<p>Most cancer treatment centers encourage patients to ring a wall-mounted bell when they complete cancer treatment to signal their progress and encouragement to other patients. But it is unclear at this time whether Biden will need to undergo any other treatment, since doctors always need to assess a patient's progress in the weeks after they complete cancer treatment.</p><p>Biden announced in May that he had an advanced stage of <span class="link">prostate cancer</span> that has metastasized, or spread, to his bones, prompting an <span class="link">outpouring of concern</span> and a new round of questions about his health and whether he faced undisclosed or unknown medical challenges during his presidency.</p><p>According to a statement from his office in May, the former president was diagnosed with "prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone" after a small nodule was found in the prostate.</p><p>Gleason scores are a grading system, and the lower the grade, the more cancer cells look like normal cells. A score of 9 is the second-highest, <span class="link">CBS News previously reported</span>, and places Biden in the most aggressive risk category. </p>
<p>Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer that affects men, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Age is the most common risk factor. The condition has many forms of treatment, including radiation, chemotherapy, surgery and hormone treatment. </p><p>Biden also <span class="link">underwent a skin cancer surgery</span> in September 2025. That procedure was a Mohs surgery, which involves cutting away thin layers of skin until only cancer-free tissue remains in the affected area. </p><p>The former president is occasionally spotted in Washington, where he still keeps an office, and aboard Amtrak trains to and from his home in Delaware. He has begun fundraising and planning for an eventual library and museum documenting his time in the White House. </p>

<div class="article-title">White House begins demolition of part of East Wing for Trump's ballroom</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington </em>— Demolition on the White House's East Wing has begun, although President Trump previously said his ballroom addition to the White House wouldn't "interfere" with the building's existing structure.  </p><p>The Washington Post first reported on the demolition and published an image of the work. And on Monday, a pool reporter captured video of part of the East Wing being torn down. </p><p>During an event Monday with the Louisiana State University baseball team at the White House, the president remarked on the construction, which he said "just started today." </p><p>"You know we're building — right behind us — we're building a ballroom," Mr. Trump said during the celebration of the 2024 NCAA champions in the White House East Room. He pointed out, "Right on the other side, you have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically."</p>
<p>The president told reporters in September that construction had begun, though at the time, no part of the White House building had been demolished.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shared a social media post by Mr. Trump Monday announcing that "ground has been broken" for the "new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom."</p><p>"For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State visits, etc.," Mr. Trump said in the post. "I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway — with zero cost to the American Taxpayer!"</p><p>The East Wing of the White House is fairly small and is where the first lady's office and staff are located.</p><p>"It won't interfere with the current building," the president said in July. "It won't be. It'll be near it but not touching it — and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of."</p>
<p>The White House says the project, which will cost $250 million, has been fully funded by private contributions from business and big tech, including Apple, Microsoft and Coinbase. Earlier this month, ballroom donors dined at the White House with Mr. Trump. </p><p>By September, a number of companies had pledged to donate $5 million or more for the addition, multiple sources familiar with the matter said. </p><p>The addition was originally planned to be 90,000 square feet, but that figure is likely to increase. The ballroom, which will be used for events that on occasion will include heads of state, is intended to hold 999 people, up from an initial estimate of 650. Mr. Trump said it will have bulletproof glass windows on all sides. </p><p>CBS News previously obtained <span class="link">renderings</span> of the ballroom. </p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Microchips implanted into the back of the eyes of legally blind patients have helped some of them read again, according to a new study published Monday.</p><p>Out of the 32 patients with geographic atrophy — an advanced form of dry <span class="link">age-related macular degeneration</span> — who completed the clinical study, 26 of them showed "meaningful improvement in visual acuity from baseline" 12 months after receiving the implant, the research published in the New England Journal of Medicine said.</p><p>The treatment involves inserting a tiny implant thinner than human hair under the retina. Patients then have to wear specia glasses, which have a video camera and project what it sees via near-infrared light to the implant. The implant-glasses combination is called the photovoltaic retina implant microarray, or PRIMA.</p>
<p>One of the people who received the treatment, 70-year-old Sheila Irvine, told CBS News partner the BBC it was "out of this world" to be able to read and do crosswords again. </p><p>"It's beautiful, wonderful. It gives me such pleasure," Irvine said. "Technology is moving so fast, it's amazing that I am part of it."</p><p>While Irvine's improvement is dramatic, it still requires a lot of concentration for her to use the PRIMA glasses, the BBC reported. She needs to put a pillow under her chin to steady the camera and it can focus on just a few letters at a time. Letters like C and O are also hard for her to distinguished without switching to magnification mode, according to the BBC.</p>
<p>Geographic atrophy, which affects some 5 million people wordwide, is the leading cause of blindness in older people. Until recently, there had been no treatment to improve patient's abilities to read or recognize faces, the study's lead author Frank Holz said.</p><p>"The achievement previously was pharmacological treatment, which slows down the progression, the expansion of the atrophic areas in the retina," Holz, a retina specialist based in Germany, told Modern Retina at a conferences of retina experts last week. </p><p>In 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved <span class="link">Syfovre</span>, the first drug aproved to treat geographic atrophy. It's administered with an injection and can slow the progression of the disease, although it does not reverse it.</p><p>There are two forms of macular degeneration: wet and dry. The wet form causes abnormal blood vessels to grow under the retina, causing scarring on the macula — which is located in the center of the retina. It impacts 15% of people and a treatment option has been on the market for many years. </p>
<p>The dry form is more common and causes the macula to get thinner and tiny protein clumps called drusen to grow. Until the FDA approved Syfovre, no treatment existed.</p><p>"But now with this device, a 2-by-2-millimeter implant, which for the first time restores visual acuity in those patients who are so advanced that they have lost completely their central portion, their central vision, in their retina," Holz said.</p><p>CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook noted that while the device can help some people with geography atrophy, the clinical study is small. </p><p>The PRIMA implant, made by California-based biotech Science Corporation, is also not yet licensed and isn't available as a treatment outside the trials, the BBC reported.</p><p>"This breakthrough underscores our commitment to pioneering technologies that provide hope to patients in need, and which have the ability to transform lives," Max Hodak, founder and CEO of Science, said in a news release Monday. "We are excited about the potential of PRIMA to redefine vision restoration for these patients."</p>

<div class="article-title">Sumo's new global star eyes America: "Of course I'll be there!"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>London</em> — Sumo's biggest international showcase in history <span class="link">rocked London</span> this week, spotlighting more than 40 wrestlers across 100 bouts with blistering palm thrusts, stunning face slaps and an unforgettable lightning-fast overarm throw. The final championship clash of the Grand Sumo Tournament was a battle of giants — a Goliath versus only a slightly smaller Goliath.</p><p>Colliding with the force of a few tons and sending clay into the air, 330-pound Hoshoryu Tomokatsu seized the blue silk belt — the mawashi— of 420-pound Onosato Daiki. Momentum carried the heavier man to the edge of the ring, then Hoshoryu powered him out, sealing a perfect 5-0 record in just 10 seconds. The 5,000-strong crowd inside London's sold-out Royal Albert Hall erupted in cheers. </p>
<p>"I'm just glad to have got through the five days with no injuries," Hoshoryu said backstage after claiming the championship trophy.</p><p>He hadn't planned a celebration, but told CBS News he's ready to go where his career takes him.</p><p>"If someone decides that we'll do this in America, of course I'll be there," said the 26-year-old. </p>
<p>For young American boys watching and dreaming of entering sumo's sacred ring, his advice was rooted in self-discipline and perseverance. </p><p>"You must work hard to be a sumo wrestler if that is your dream. Everyone has dreams — but only you can achieve them," he said.</p><p>Sumo is a life of devotion. Wrestlers typically begin training around age 15, the minimum age to join a heya, or stable, where they live communally and train full-time under a stablemaster, a retired wrestler. To outsiders, sumo may look like a sport but for its practitioners, it is a way of life shaped by 1,500 years of ritual and discipline, rooted in Shinto prayers for a bountiful harvest.</p>
<p>London's Royal Albert Hall — better known for the echoes of The Beatles, Beyoncé and Bruce Springsteen than the slaps and grunts of massive muscle men — was transformed into a place of reverence to reflect that. </p>
<p>"I've worked here 11 years, and this is one of the most exciting weeks I've ever been part of," said David Gamble, head of programming at the hall, who gave CBS News a special, behind-the-scenes tour. </p><p>"We've had teams, artisans in the U.K. create this 1.5 ton roof," he said, gesturing to the massive hanging roof over the ring reminiscent of a Shinto shrine. "It is more than sport … we had a ring blessing ceremony where the Sumo Association blessed the ring in the same way that they would for all of their shows in Tokyo."</p><p>He explained the few rows of red floor mats circling the ring were the most coveted — and the riskiest.</p><p>"You're really going to have to stay focused because at any moment there might be a 400 pound sumo wrestler bearing down on you, so no time to check your phone," Gamble said with a grin. These seats are "the most expensive, the best and the most dangerous."</p><p>Big wrestlers meant big logistics. The venue brought in 10 tons of clay to build the sacred ring — the dohyō — and had to procure nearly a ton of rice. The athletes consume up to 10,000 calories a day, mostly in the form of a protein-rich stew, called chanko-nabe<em>. </em></p><p>The heaviest sumo wrestler ever recorded remains Konishiki Yasokichi, the Hawaiian-American who weighed 633 pounds at his peak. He competed at the Royal Albert Hall in 1991, when sumo first ventured beyond Japan's shores — the last time the hall hosted the sport until now.</p><p>This week's event marked sumo's first overseas tournament in 34 years, and only its second in history. The more than 40 "rishiki" — not all from Japan but Mongolia and Ukraine too — stopped a lot of people in their tracks outside Buckingham Palace and Big Ben, crossing Abbey Road like The Beatles and at the "Harry Potter" Platform 9 3/4 attraction at King's Cross station.</p>
<p>As Hoshoryu raised his championship trophy — the ornate Emperor's Cup, flown in from Tokyo — the moment symbolized more than victory. It was a celebration of an ancient Japanese tradition finding new life — and new fans — far from home.</p>

<div class="article-title">Open enrollment may bring sticker shock as health insurance set to surge</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Open enrollment — the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits — may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new analysis from consultant Mercer. </p><p>That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers. </p><p>More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% — or 164.7 million people — covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.</p><p>Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's 2024 employer health benefits survey.</p><p>The findings come as American households continue to feel <span class="link">squeezed by rising prices</span>, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the <span class="link">GLP-1 drugs</span> used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said. </p>
<p>Employees "might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well — higher co-pays, higher deductibles — so it's getting hit on both ends," Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.</p><p>Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.</p><p>Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. "We think costs are pretty sticky right now," he said.</p><h2>Financial squeeze </h2><p>Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August analysis.</p>
<p>In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a December report. </p><p>Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank. </p><p>A KFF poll in July found that four in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance. </p><p>"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give," Owens said. That could mean cutting "a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting <span class="link">groceries on the credit card</span> so you can clear the health care premiums."</p><p>The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24. </p>

<div class="article-title">Trump calls for Ukraine ceasefire with Russia holding occupied territory</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump reiterated his call on Sunday for an immediate halt to the three-and-a-half-year full-scale war in Ukraine, saying the battle lines should be frozen where they currently stand, with Russia's invading forces occupying most of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. </p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly rejected the idea of forfeiting the Donbas, or any other occupied ground, to Moscow in the years since Vladimir Putin ordered Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. </p><p>"Let it be cut the way it is. It's cut up right now. I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia. You leave it the way it is right now," Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday on Air Force One, apparently referring specifically to the Donbas region. "They can negotiate something later on down the line. But I said cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people."</p><p>The <span class="link">Donbas is a culturally and economically significant region</span>, where many people speak Russian and have sympathies with Moscow. It is home to much of Ukraine's heavy industry and mining, accounting for about 16% of the country's GDP before the war started, according to The Associated Press.  </p><p>His remarks came two days after Mr. <span class="link">Trump met in person with Zelenskyy</span> at the White House, which was a day after he spoke on the phone for two hours with Putin.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy appeared to reiterate Kyiv's unwillingness to cede any territory for a ceasefire on Sunday, meanwhile, saying he had urged European leaders to apply "the right kind of pressure" on Russia. </p>
<p>"Almost every day now, we are communicating with leaders to ensure that we have a common position, all of us in Europe, on putting pressure on Russia — the right kind of pressure. We will grant the aggressor no gifts and forget nothing," Zelenskyy said in a social media post. </p><p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Sunday that Ukraine should not be put under pressure to make concessions on its territory.</p><p>"None of us should put pressure on Zelenskyy when it comes to territorial concessions," he said in a social media post. "We should all put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression. Appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace."</p><p>In another social media post, Zelenskyy called his Friday Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump a "pointed conversation." </p>
<p>The Financial Times newspaper reported Sunday that the meeting had descended into a shouting match on occasion, with Mr. Trump "cursing all the time." Zelenskyy's delegation had brought in maps of the battlefield and Mr. Trump threw them to one side saying he was "sick" of seeing them, according to the FT report, which cited an official familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>In response to a request for comment on the report of a second heated exchange between the leaders, the White House referred CBS News on Monday to Mr. Trump's remarks to reporters on Air Force One, without providing any additional description of the meeting. The Ukrainian president's office did not immediately reply to CBS News' request for comment for this story.  </p><p>Mr. Trump said in a post on his own Truth Social media platform that his meeting with the Ukrainian leader was "very interesting, and cordial."</p><p>Speaking with reporters on Sunday, in remarks that were embargoed until Monday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine shared "President Trump's positive outlook if it leads to the end  of the war. After many rounds of discussion over more than two hours  with him and his team, his message, in my view, is positive — that we  stand where we stand on the line of contact, provided all sides  understand what is meant."</p><p>"I told him, as I likewise strongly suggested to President Putin, that it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL! Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts. They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide," Mr. Trump said Sunday. </p><p>The White House meeting followed Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy's <span class="link">incredibly tense encounter</span> in front of television cameras in February.    </p><p>The president had spoken on Thursday with Putin by phone. Following that lengthy discussion, the White House said Mr. Trump would hold a second bilateral summit with Putin in Hungary's capital, Budapest, at a still-to-be-confirmed date to discuss a possible ceasefire deal. Mr. Trump said it would likely happen within a couple weeks.</p>
<p>It will be their second bilateral meeting this year, following in-person talks in Alaska in August. That diplomatic effort by Mr. Trump yielded no tangible results, as Moscow has continued to press its military campaign, taking more territory on the ground and bombarding Ukrainian cities from the air. Putin has also so far declined Mr. Trump's urging to hold a three-way meeting with Zelenskyy.</p><p>U.S. and Ukrainian officials told CBS News that <span class="link">Zelenskyy had hoped</span> Mr. Trump would agree to a deal at Friday's meeting to supply Tomahawk missiles, but that has not yet materialized. Kyiv sees the long-range, guided cruise missiles as vital to give Ukraine's armed forces the ability to hit critical military, logistical and energy targets deep inside Russia. </p><p>Ukraine has ramped up its attacks on key Russian energy infrastructure in recent months. The General Staff of the Armed Services, Ukraine's military headquarters, said Sunday in a social media post that it had struck the Orenburg Gas plant in southern Russia, one of the country's largest natural gas processing plants. </p><p>"The Defense Forces of Ukraine are consistently implementing a set of measures to damage critical enterprises involved in ensuring the needs of the Russian Armed Forces," the general staff staff.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has implemented a policy of selling weapons to Ukraine via America's European NATO allies, who foot the bill for the hardware, since August. That arrangement was worked out between Mr. Trump and other NATO leaders earlier in the summer.  </p><p>Despite positive signals from the White House in recent months regarding a potential deal to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles, Mr. Trump demurred on the subject when asked about it by reporters Friday during his meeting with Zelenskyy. </p><p>"One thing I have to say, we want Tomahawks, also. We don't want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country," Mr. Trump said. </p>
<p>Vice President JD Vance told reporters on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews on Sunday that Mr. Trump had not yet made a final decision on whether to grant Ukraine access to the missiles. </p><p>"If he thinks it is in America's best interest to sell additional weapons to Europe, he will do that, but right now he has not made that decision with regards to Tomahawks," Vance said.</p>

<div class="article-title">The White House starts demolishing part of the East Wing to build Trump's ballroom</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>WASHINGTON — The White House on Monday started tearing down part of the East Wing, the traditional base of operations for the first lady, to build President Trump's $250 million ballroom despite lacking approval for construction from the federal agency that oversees such projects.</p>
<p>Dramatic photos of the demolition work showed construction equipment tearing into the East Wing façade and windows and other building parts in tatters on the ground. Some reporters watched from a park near the Treasury Department, which is next to the East Wing.</p> <p>Trump announced the start of construction in a social media post and referenced the work while hosting 2025 college baseball champs Louisiana State University and LSU-Shreveport in the East Room. He noted the work was happening "right behind us."</p>
<p>"We have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically," he said, adding, "It just started today."</p> <p>The White House has moved ahead with the massive construction project despite not yet having sign-off from the National Capital Planning Commission, which approves construction work and major renovations to government buildings in the Washington area.</p>
<p>Its chairman, Will Scharf, who is also the White House staff secretary and one of Trump's top aides, said at the commission's September meeting that agency does not have jurisdiction over demolition or site preparation work for buildings on federal property.</p> <p>"What we deal with is essentially construction, vertical build," Scharf said last month.</p> <p>It was unclear whether the White House had submitted the ballroom plans for the agency's review and approval. The White House did not respond to a request for comment and the commission's offices are closed because of the government shutdown.</p> <p>The Republican president had said in July when the project was announced that the ballroom would not interfere with the mansion itself.</p> <p>"It'll be near it but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of," he said of the White House.</p>
<p>The East Wing houses several offices, including those of the first lady. It was built in 1902 and has been renovated over the years, with a second story added in 1942, according to the White House.</p> <p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said those East Wing offices will be temporarily relocated during construction and that wing of the building will be modernized and renovated.</p>
<p>"Nothing will be torn down," Leavitt said when she announced the project in July.</p> <p>Trump insists that presidents have desired such a ballroom for 150 years and that he's adding the massive 90,000-square-foot, glass-walled space because the East Room, which is the largest room in the White House with an approximately 200-person capacity, is too small. He also has said he does not like the idea of hosting kings, queens, presidents and prime ministers in pavilions on the South Lawn.</p> <p>Trump said in the social media announcement that the project would be completed "with zero cost to the American Taxpayer! The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly."</p> <p>The ballroom will be the biggest structural change to the Executive Mansion since the addition in 1948 of the Truman Balcony overlooking the South Lawn, even dwarfing the residence itself.</p> <p>At a dinner he hosted last week for some of the wealthy business executives who are donating money toward the $250 million construction cost, Trump said the project had grown in size and now will accommodate 999 people. The capacity was 650 seated people at the July announcement.</p> <p>The White House has said it will disclose information on who has contributed money to build the ballroom, but has yet to do so.</p> <p>Trump also said at last week's event that the head of Carrier Global Corp., a leading manufacturer of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, had offered to donate the air conditioning system for the ballroom.</p>
<p>Carrier confirmed to The Associated Press on Monday that it had done so. A cost estimate was not immediately available.</p> <p>"Carrier is honored to provide the new iconic ballroom at the White House with a world-class, energy-efficient HVAC system, bringing comfort to distinguished guests and dignitaries in this historic setting for years to come," the company said in an emailed statement.</p> <p>The clearing of trees on the south grounds and other site preparation work started in September. Plans call for the ballroom to be ready before Trump's term ends in January 2029.</p>

<div class="article-title">Outage at Amazon Web Services disrupts websites across the internet</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A massive outage at Amazon Web Services disrupted major websites and apps on Monday, in a show of how one company's online infrastructure has become essential for many modern businesses to function.</p> <p>Amazon said it was fixing the problem, but some disruptions were still ongoing as of Monday evening.</p> <p>Tech experts tell NPR the incident highlights just how vulnerable companies are to these kinds of outages.</p> <p>Here's what to know about what happened and why a single outage could be so damaging.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">The outage started early Monday</h3> <p>Amazon reported "increased error rates and latencies" starting around 3 a.m. ET that involved its facility in Northern Virginia.</p> <p>Users reported trouble with popular websites and apps including Duolingo and the online games Roblox and Fortnite. Financial service companies like Coinbase, Robinhood and Venmo also reported disruptions, as did the companies that operate the chatbots Perplexity and ChatGPT. Amazon said its main website was affected. United Airlines, Canva, Reddit and Flickr also acknowledged problems with their websites. The Associated Press, NPR and <em>The New York Times</em>' Games also said they had issues.</p> <p>Amazon said late Monday that it was making "progress" to restoring full functionality.</p> <h3 class="edTag">How Amazon's cloud computing powers much of the internet</h3> <p>Amazon's cloud computing service, AWS, is like an invisible scaffolding that helps much of the internet function.</p> <p>AWS lets companies store and manage data online using its database service DynamoDB, which was the service affected by the outage.</p> <p>"In other words, they rent out their cloud computing resources to others so they can serve their own customers," says Chang Lou,<strong> </strong>an assistant professor at the University of Virginia who specializes in cloud computing.</p> <p>An early-morning software update to DynamoDB, however, contained an error, which took down the service in Northern Virginia. The error within that update then caused a chain reaction of service failures and disruptions.</p>
<p>Amazon says it has invested more than $50 billion in data centers in the state, which is home to the largest cluster of data centers in the United States.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Amazon's importance in cloud computing is a mixed bag for customers</h3> <p>According to Synergy Research Group, AWS holds about 30% of the worldwide cloud computing market. Other big players are Microsoft and Google.</p> <p>Betsy Cooper, a cybersecurity expert and the director of the Aspen Institute's Policy Academy, says there are pros and cons to companies using Amazon or another big provider for cloud computing. They offer strong cybersecurity protections and convenience.</p>
<p>"We all have an incentive to use the big companies, because they're so ubiquitous and it's easier for us to access all of our data in one place."</p> <p>But, she says, there's a downside.</p> <p>"That's great until something goes wrong, and then you really see just how dependent you are on a handful of those companies."</p> <p><em>Editor's note:</em> <em>Amazon is a financial supporter of NPR, and it pays to distribute some of NPR's content. Microsoft and Google are also NPR financial supporters.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Hollywood pushes OpenAI for consent</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>OpenAI says it has released new policies for an artificial intelligence tool called Sora 2, in response to concerns from Hollywood studios, unions and talent agencies.</p> <p>The tool allows users to create realistic, high-quality audio and video, using text prompts and images.</p> <p>"It's about creating new possibilities," OpenAI promised in a promotional video for Sora 2. "You can view the power to step into any world or scene, and letting your friends cast you in theirs."</p> <p>But with Sora 2, some creators have also made fake AI-generated videos of historical figures doing things they never did. For example, Martin Luther King, Jr. changing his "I Have a Dream" speech, Michael Jackson, rapping and stealing someone's chicken nuggets, or Mr. Rogers greeting rapper Tupac Shakur to his neighborhood.</p>
<p>Some videos reimagined the late Robin Williams talking on a park bench and in other locations. His daughter Zelda begged fans to stop sending her such AI-generated content, calling it "horrible slop."</p> <p>"You're not making art," she wrote on Instagram, "You're making disgusting, over-processed hotdogs out of the lives of human beings."</p>
<p>"It's kind of cool, it's kind of scary," says actress Chaley Rose, who's best known for her role in the TV series <em>Nashville</em>. "People can borrow from actors, our vulnerability and our art to teach the characters they create how to do what we do. I would hate to have my image out there and not have given permission or to actually be the one doing the acting and having control over the performance."</p> <p>Hollywood's top talent agencies first sounded the alarm.</p> <p>"There is no substitute for human talent in our business, and we will continue to fight tirelessly for our clients to ensure that they are protected," United Talent Agency wrote in a statement last week. "When it comes to OpenAI's Sora or any other platform that seeks to profit from our clients' intellectual property and likeness, we stand with artists. The future of industries based on creative expression and artistry relies on controls, protections, and rightful compensation. The use of such property without consent, credit or compensation is exploitation, not innovation."</p>
<p>Creative Artists Agency issued a similar warning last week. </p> <p>Last year, California's governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill requiring the consent of actors and performers to use their digital replicas.</p> <p>Now, the talent agencies and SAG-AFTRA (which also represents many NPR employees) announced they and OpenAI are supporting similar federal legislation, called the "NO FAKES" Act.</p> <p>Until now, some of the videos created using Sora 2 have relied on copyrighted material. For instance, there's a video that shows the animated character SpongeBob Squarepants cooking up illicit drugs.</p>
<p>The Motion Picture Association, which represents major Hollywood studios, said in a statement that since Sora 2's release, "videos that infringe our members' films, shows, and characters have proliferated on OpenAI's service and across social media."</p>
<p>Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director of the union SAG-AFTRA told NPR last week that it wasn't feasible for rightsholders to find every possible use of their material.</p> <p>"It's a moment of real concern and danger for everyone in the entertainment industry. And it should be for all Americans, all of us, really," says Crabtree-Ireland. </p> <p>SAG-AFTRA says actor Bryan Cranston alerted the union to possible abuses. Now, the union and talent agencies say they're grateful OpenAI listened to such concerns. </p> <p>The company has announced an "opt-in" policy allowing all artists, performers, and individuals the right to determine how and whether they can be simulated. OpenAI says it will block the generation of well-known characters on its public feed and will take down any existing material not in compliance.</p> <p>Last week, OpenAI agreed to take down phony videos of Martin Luther King, Jr., after his estate complained about the "disrespectful depictions" of the late civil rights leader.</p>

<div class="article-title">9th Circuit rules that National Guard can deploy to Portland</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A divided federal appeals court for the 9th Circuit on Monday overturned a temporary restraining order put in place by a federal judge in Portland — removing a legal impediment that was preventing the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon.</p> <p>"After considering the record at this preliminary stage, we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority,'" the majority wrote in its decision.</p> <p>It's unclear what impact this ruling will immediately have on the ground. The 9th Circuit's decision applies to only one of the two temporary restraining orders that U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued this month blocking the deployment.</p>
<p>"Right now, until the district court acts on the second TRO, national guard members from Oregon, or any other state cannot deploy," Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said in a statement.</p> <p>The ruling comes in the wake of a series of Trump authorizations to deploy National Guard troops to American cities including Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Chicago. President Trump has said the deployments are necessary to protect the work of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and reduce crime.</p> <p>On Oct. 16, a federal appeals court upheld an earlier District Court ruling in Illinois, temporarily blocking the president's federalization and deployment of the National Guard there. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Trump called the National Guard to Portland last month</strong></h3> <p>The Trump administration federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard on Sept. 28 after the president described Portland on social media as "War ravaged" and "under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists."</p> <p>This characterization is false, according to local and state officials, residents and journalists on the ground. Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek told NPR on Oct. 6 that the president's portrayal was "ludicrous."</p> <p>"We had thousands of people on the streets of Portland for the Portland Marathon," she said. "The city is beautiful. The city is thriving."</p>
<p>The federal government has argued in court documents that the National Guard is needed to protect an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland that has been the site of protests since June. They wrote that protesters had assaulted federal officers "with rocks, bricks, pepper spray and incendiary devices, causing injury."</p> <p>In their own court documents, attorneys for the city of Portland and the state of Oregon wrote that the protests had been small and largely peaceful for months.</p>
<p>In a declaration provided to the court, Craig Dobson, an assistant chief with the Portland Police Bureau (PPB), stated that the protests have never been so out of control that local officers couldn't respond.</p> <p>"In fact, on any given weekend," he stated, "the nightlife in Portland's entertainment district has warranted greater PPB resources than the small, nightly protests in front of the ICE facility."</p> <p>The federal government, however, has argued that things have been quieter because 115 federal police officers were sent to Portland this summer to help protect the ICE building there. It says some of those federal officers have since been sent back. And while it's unclear how many remain, the federal government says their deployment is a strain on resources.</p> <p>In response, attorneys for the state of Oregon have said such deployments are a normal part of the federal police's responsibilities.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Lower court blocked the deployment </strong></h3> <p>On Oct. 4, Immergut, the U.S. district judge, granted the city and state a temporary restraining order, preventing the federal government from deploying the National Guard to Portland.</p> <p>The president can federalize National Guard members if there's a foreign invasion, a rebellion or a danger of one, or an inability to carry out federal laws with "regular forces."</p> <p>Immergut wrote that the Trump administration did not have a legitimate basis for federalizing the National Guard because the protests in Portland had been "generally peaceful" since June and did not prevent federal law enforcement officers from doing their jobs.</p>
<p>She wrote that the Trump administration described only a few incidents of protesters clashing with federal officers in September before the National Guard federalization. They involved people shining overpowered flashlights in the eyes of drivers, "posting a photograph of an unmarked ICE vehicle online" and "setting up a makeshift guillotine to intimidate federal officials."</p> <p>"These incidents are inexcusable," Immergut wrote, "but they are nowhere near the type of incidents that cannot be handled by regular law enforcement forces."</p> <p>The following day, despite her ruling, Trump sent 200 federalized California National Guard members to Oregon. A memo from the Department of Defense also authorized up to 400 members of the Texas National Guard to deploy to Portland and Chicago.</p>
<p>Immergut then granted a second order blocking the Trump administration from sending any federalized members from any National Guard to Oregon.</p>
<p>In its appeal to the 9th Circuit, the Trump administration said in court documents that the lower court judge had "impermissibly second-guessed the Commander in Chief's military judgments."</p> <p>On Oct. 6, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a press briefing: "With all due respect to that judge, I think her opinion is untethered in reality and in the law." She went on to say that the president was using his authority as commander in chief.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Appeals court sides with the president</strong></h3> <p>The majority opinion for the 9th Circuit was authored by judges Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade, who were both appointed during Trump's first term.</p> <p>They wrote that the District Court erred when it discounted "the violent and disruptive events that occurred in June, July, and August" outside the ICE facility and focused "on only a few events in September," the month Trump federalized the National Guard.</p> <p>The law, they argued, didn't put such limitations on the facts or circumstances that the president could consider when making a decision to deploy the National Guard.</p> <p>"The President can, and should, consider the totality of the circumstances when determining whether he 'is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States,'" they wrote.</p> <p>"Rather than reviewing the President's determination with great deference," the panel of judges wrote, "the district court substituted its own determination of the relevant facts and circumstances."</p>
<p>Appeals court Judge Susan Graber, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, dissented, writing there was no justification to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard.</p> <p>"Given Portland protesters' well-known penchant for wearing chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all when expressing their disagreement with the methods employed by ICE, observers may be tempted to view the majority's ruling, which accepts the government's characterization of Portland as a war zone, as merely absurd," Graber wrote.</p> <p>Officials at the White House praised the court's ruling Monday, saying it affirms that the lower court's ruling "was unlawful and incorrect."</p>
<p>"As we have always maintained, President Trump is exercising his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel following violent riots that local leaders have refused to address," Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement.</p> <p>Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield also responded to Monday's ruling with a statement: "Today's ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification," he wrote. "We are on a dangerous path in America."</p> <p><em>Clarification: An earlier version of this story said the 9th Circuit decision removed "the" legal impediment to Trump's deployment of the national guard troops to Portland, implying it was singular. While the court granted a stay for one temporary restraining order, at the time of publication a second order is still in force, so the immediate impact of this ruling is unclear.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">This isn't the Louvre's first high-profile heist. Here's a history of earlier thefts</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The Louvre Museum in Paris is closed after masked thieves stole priceless jewels in what officials have described as a seven-minute heist in broad daylight.</p> <p>Shortly after the museum opened on Sunday morning, two bandits used a lift on a truck to break into its Galerie d'Apollon, which houses the French crown jewels and other treasures, through a second-floor window. That's according to the Paris prosecutor's office, which is looking for four male suspects.</p>
<p>The thieves smashed display cases, stealing what a Louvre spokesperson described as eight items of "inestimable cultural and historical value." They then fled toward a nearby highway on high-powered scooters. Two pieces of jewelry — including the crown of Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III — were found near the museum afterward.</p> <p>The heist deals a huge blow to one of the most popular museums in the world, which houses valuable works like Leonardo da Vinci's <em>Mona Lisa</em> and has drawn some 9 million visitors in recent years.</p>
<p>But it's not a first. Thieves have raided the Louvre multiple times over the decades — and once managed to snatch <em>Mona Lisa</em> herself right off the wall.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A heist made the <em>Mona Lisa</em> famous<strong> </strong></h3> <p>The Louvre was built in the 12th century as a military fortress, and by the 14th century was used as a royal residence and art collection center.</p> <p>The revolutionary government opened the Louvre as a public museum, the Musée Central des Arts, in 1793. It displayed art that had previously been held in the royal collection, embodying the Enlightenment ideals that had ignited the French Revolution four years earlier.</p>
<p>The Louvre now boasts some 35,000 works on permanent display. And despite its fortified history, it has fallen victim to multiple high-profile security breaches, including the 1911 theft of the <em>Mona Lisa</em>.</p> <p>On a Monday morning that August, Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian handyman who had briefly worked at the Louvre, donned his old uniform, walked into the museum and, when the coast was clear, took the painting right off the wall. He slipped it out of its frame in a nearby stairwell and carried it out of the building underneath his smock.</p> <p>At this time, the <em>Mona Lisa </em>was not widely known outside the art world. And because the museum was in the practice of briefly taking paintings off the walls to photograph them, the <em>Mona Lisa</em>'s disappearance went unnoticed for a whopping 28 hours — at which point it quickly became international news.</p>
<p>"The <em>Mona Lisa</em> becomes this incredibly famous painting, literally overnight," writer and historian James Zug told NPR in 2011, a century later.</p>
<p>In fact, the heist got so much attention that Peruggia decided not to try to sell it and stashed it away in the false bottom of a trunk instead.</p> <p>He did try to sell it more than two years later, approaching an art dealer in Florence who immediately grew suspicious and alerted authorities. Peruggia eventually pleaded guilty to stealing the painting — saying he wanted to return it to its native Italy — and was sentenced to eight months in prison.</p> <h3 class="edTag">The heists didn't stop there </h3> <p>The Louvre and its works survived Nazi Germany's occupation of France during World War II, thanks to Jacques Jaujard, the director of France's national museums.</p> <p>On the eve of the war, Jaujard, with the help of staff and volunteers, secretly arranged for the <em>Mona Lisa</em> and thousands of other masterpieces to be evacuated to the French countryside to protect them from looting.</p>
<p>But Nazi forces did systematically loot tens of thousands of works from Jewish families and wealthy collectors during the war. Many of them were returned to France through postwar government efforts, but have not been reclaimed. The Louvre began displaying them in 2018, as part of a renewed push to reunite them with the heirs of their original owners.</p> <p>The postwar period saw a string of bold daytime art thefts, as<em> </em><em>National Geographic</em> reports.</p> <p>In May 1966, thieves stole five pieces of antique gold and ruby jewelry from the airline cargo terminal at JFK Airport in New York City. The pieces were on their way back to the Louvre after being displayed on loan at a Virginia museum.</p> <p>The <em>New York Times </em>reported that two months later, detectives found the jewelry in a grocery bag as it was being passed "from one man to two others in exchange for an envelope containing $2,900." All three were arrested.</p>
<p>A decade later, in December 1976, three masked men broke into the Louvre and stole what the <em>New York Times</em> described as "the priceless diamond-studded sword of King Charles X." That theft bears striking similarities to Sunday's events.</p>
<p>A museum spokesperson told the paper at the time that the trio "climbed a metal scaffolding set up by workers cleaning the facade of the former palace and smashed unbarred windows on the second floor," then smashed a display case to grab the sword. They clubbed two guards and "raced into the Apollo Hall" — the same gallery that was targeted this weekend — but fled the way they came after triggering an automated alarm.</p> <p>The sword has never been recovered. <em>The Times</em> notes that it wasn't the only item stolen from the Louvre in 1976: That January, it says, "burglars made off with a painting of the Flemish school."</p>
<p>Two pieces of 16th-century Italian armor were taken from the Louvre one evening in May 1983, a mystery that persisted for decades until the breastplate and helmet turned up at an estate auction in Bordeaux, France in early 2021. The pieces were reinstalled in the museum that year, but details about their disappearance remain scarce.</p> <p>In July 1990, thieves cut a small painting — Pierre Auguste Renoir's <em>Portrait of a Seated Woman</em> — from its frame and stole it in broad daylight from a third-floor gallery, according to news reports at the time. That triggered an inventory, which revealed that a dozen pieces of ancient Roman jewelry had also been taken sometime before then.</p> <p>And in May 1998, a thief made off with a 19th-century landscape by the French painter Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. According to news reports, after a guard discovered it missing, officials shut down the museum for hours and police conducted body searches on hundreds of visitors as they exited. The painting has never been found.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Why do these breaches keep happening?</h3>
<p>In the wake of the 1990 thefts, then-Louvre director Michel Laclotte declared a "crisis," the <em>Washington Post</em> reported at the time.</p> <p>Laclotte said the crisis would be used to increase museum security measures, including upping its security budget by about $1.8 million and hiring a "super-specialist" to recommend policy changes.</p>
<p>But issues like overcrowding, disrepair and climate change have continued to plague the Louvre.</p> <p>Tensions reached a boiling point this January, when Laurence des Cars, the Louvre's president-director, sent a letter to France's culture minister outlining issues of concern — which was leaked to the press.</p> <p>They included "increasing malfunctions in severely degraded spaces," "outdated technical equipment," and "alarming temperature fluctuations endangering the conservation of artworks," according to the French newspaper <em>Le Parisien.</em></p>
<p>Later that month, French President Emmanuel Macron presented extensive renovation plans for the museum, which are expected to cost as much as $834 million and take nearly a decade to complete.</p> <p>Among other changes, the project would establish a dedicated room for the <em>Mona Lisa</em>, create a new "grand entrance" to relieve congestion and upgrade the building's security system.</p> <p>Louvre staff — including gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel — say those upgrades can't come soon enough.</p> <p>In June, the museum shut down for part of a day after staff spontaneously went on strike to protest "unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called 'untenable' working conditions," the Associated Press reported.</p> <p>Those vulnerabilities are top of mind in the wake of Sunday's heist, as other cultural institutions tighten security and French officials take the blame.</p> <p>"What is certain is that we have failed, since people were able to park a furniture hoist in the middle of Paris, get people up it in several minutes to grab priceless jewels," Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin told France Inter radio on Monday.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump's fake video featured 'Danger Zone.' Musician Kenny Loggins wants it scrubbed</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins is asking President Trump to remove the audio of one of his performances from a contentious AI-generated video that Trump posted on his Truth Social account on Saturday evening.</p> <p>In the fake video, a crown-wearing Trump is in a fighter jet emblazoned "KING TRUMP." Accompanied by Loggins singing "Danger Zone" — a hit single from the 1986 movie <em>Top Gun</em> — the plane dumps sludgy brown material over crowds of protesters carrying American flags and signs in what appears to be New York City's Times Square.</p> <p>The video was published as an apparent reply to the widespread No Kings protests that took place across the U.S. on Saturday. (On Saturday evening, the official White House account posted a fake image on X of Trump and Vice President Vance wearing crowns, juxtaposed with a fake image of Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in sombreros.)</p>
<p>In a statement sent to NPR on Monday morning, Loggins wrote: "This is an unauthorized use of my performance of 'Danger Zone.' Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately." ("Danger Zone" was written by <em>Top Gun</em>'s score composer, Giorgio Moroder, and songwriter Tom Whitlock, with Loggins as the performer.)</p> <p>Loggins continued: "I can't imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us. Too many people are trying to tear us apart, and we need to find new ways to come together. We're all Americans, and we're all patriotic. There is no 'us and them' – that's not who we are, nor is it what we should be. It's all of us. We're in this together, and it is my hope that we can embrace music as a way of celebrating and uniting each and every one of us."</p> <p>There is a long history of musicians objecting to the current president (among other political leaders) using their work to send political messages. However, such use is generally legal, as long as rights holders are paid correctly; the only use that performers and songwriters can specifically prohibit is the use of songs in campaign advertisements. Even so, many artists choose to make such objections public so that a general audience is aware of their stance.</p>
<p>NPR reached out to the White House for a response to Loggins' specific objections and his request that his performance be removed.</p> <p>In reply, White House spokesperson Davis R. Ingle did not respond to NPR's questions but sent NPR an image from the film <em>Top Gun</em> of stars Tom Cruise and the late Val Kilmer, captioned: "I FEEL THE NEED FOR SPEED."</p> <p>Various musicians and their representatives, including The White Stripes and the estate of Isaac Hayes, have filed civil suits against Trump alleging copyright infringement. The White Stripes dropped their suit in November 2024. The Hayes suit, which was filed against the president, his reelection campaign and the activist group Turning Point Action, is continuing to wend its way through federal court in Atlanta.</p>

<div class="article-title">Cannabis blunts back pain in 2 new studies</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Should I try cannabis for my back pain?</p> <p>It's a question spine surgeon Richard Price says he gets at least several times a day from patients who come into his clinic.</p> <p>When Price finally dived into the evidence several years ago, he found there were not many high quality studies, even though chronic pain is one of the most common reasons people turn to medical marijuana.</p> <p>"Anecdotally, [people] say cannabis works great," says Price, an assistant professor of neurological surgery at UC Davis. "It's the only thing that helps them sleep at night, the only thing that takes the edge off."</p>
<p>This is why findings from a pair of major clinical trials in Europe that evaluated cannabis for low back pain — the leading cause of disability worldwide — have caught the attention of Price and others who are investigating the plant's potential in pain management.</p> <p>The first, published in the journal <em>Nature Medicine</em>, showed that a blend of cannabis oil, containing the psychoactive compound THC, as well as CBD and other natural compounds in the plant, outperformed a placebo.</p> <p>The other compared that same proprietary cannabis tincture with opioids. Here, patients were much less likely to have gastrointestinal side effects like constipation, and cannabis offered better relief over 6 months than their painkillers.</p> <p>Price believes the new studies are "groundbreaking" and will be a "cornerstone" of the growing evidence base on cannabis and chronic pain.</p> <p>Because cannabis remains a Schedule 1 drug — a category reserved for substances with no accepted medical use — and is heavily regulated, this type of large-scale clinical trial is tough to pull off in the U.S.</p> <p>Vertanical, the German company that funded the trials, expects to win approval to market their full-spectrum cannabis oil, called VER-01, to patients in several European countries in a matter of months.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration is requiring the company replicate this research in the U.S., meaning it could be years before the drug has a chance to win approval here.</p>
<p>"If politicians or the FDA want to speed up the process, we are ready," says Dr. Clemens Fischer, the founder of Vertanical.</p> <p>The FDA wouldn't comment on the future of VER-01, but a spokesperson told NPR in a statement that it supports "rigorous, science-based research to evaluate these products."</p> <h3 class="edTag">A pain relief alternative</h3> <p>The findings from the European trials are "remarkable," particularly the fact that cannabis outperformed opioids in terms of pain relief and sleep, says Kevin Boehnke, an<em> </em>assistant professor of anesthesiology at the University of Michigan who studies cannabis and chronic pain.</p>
<p>The opioid trial had close to 400 participants — about half the size of the other study comparing cannabis and a placebo — and patients knew which drug they were receiving.</p>
<p>While these are limitations, Boehnke says the study was also more "reflective" of the real world and validates previous research indicating "many people deliberately use cannabis in place of opioids" because they find it more effective and doesn't come with the same side effects.</p> <p>Though Vertanical's cannabis tincture may not be available in the U.S. anytime soon, Boehnke says for people seeking treatment for low-back pain, the study suggests it may be worth trying a similar cannabis product instead of opioids.</p> <p>"It might not be exactly the same," he says. "But I think this provides a lot of useful evidence for patients."</p> <p>Others in the field are more circumspect, though.</p> <p>This is the kind of rigorous study that's sorely needed, says Simon Haroutounian, who has decades of experience in this area and directs research at the Washington University Pain Center in St. Louis.</p> <p>But he thinks the findings are specific to this particular compound that was tested.</p> <p>In the trial, those in the cannabis group had, on average, about a 30% drop in pain after 12 weeks compared to their baseline. Meanwhile, those who took the placebo had around a 20% reduction. </p> <p>Haroutounian says it's likely the actual treatment effect is the difference between the two.</p> <p>Another way to look at the efficacy is that the number of people who need to take the drug for one person to get clinically meaningful pain relief is around seven.</p> <p>"Most of the medications that we have at our disposal for treating chronic pain are in that range," Haroutounian says. "So it's not panacea, it's not a compound that is going to treat all chronic pain."</p> <p>Proponents of medical cannabis are quick to point out the drug's safety profile is a clear upside. Unlike opioids, it doesn't come with the same concerns around overdose and addiction.</p>
<p>Fischer of Vertanical notes there were no signs of dependency or withdrawal. In fact, he says the participants usually didn't feel high, particularly if they'd taken it for a longer stretch of time.</p> <p>"You're not stoned," he says. "They go to work, they drive cars, they use machinery, all possible and legal in Europe."</p> <p>In the study, however, those on opioids and cannabis did experience about the same rate of side effects, and about 13% ultimately dropped out.</p> <p>Over the years, Haroutounian, a clinical pharmacist, has seen successes and failures with his own patients.</p> <p>One patient had suffered a horrific motorcycle injury and eventually tapered off opioids with the help of cannabis. On the other hand, he recalls the case of an older woman who tried cannabis for knee pain.</p> <p>"With the first dose, she felt dizzy. She fell and broke her hip," he says, "The next six months she spent in and out of hospital."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Pain patients want cannabis options</h3> <p>Currently there's only one cannabis-derived medication with FDA approval, the seizure treatment Epidiolex, and it doesn't contain any THC.</p> <p>While it's not entirely clear, experts like Boehnke say THC seems to be one of the "primary" compounds responsible for cutting down pain and improving sleep.</p> <p>"There is no silver bullet chronic pain medication, pretty much for anything," he says, "It's often like, 'oh, I got a little benefit here and a little there,' you're kind of piecing together the puzzle."</p> <p>Although most Americans live in a state where marijuana is legal, either recreationally or medically, there are well-documented concerns about the quality and consistency of these products.</p> <p>Ellen Lenox Smith, who's with the U.S. Pain Foundation, says FDA approval of a cannabis product would not only make it available in all states – but also give patients with chronic pain confidence in what they were using.</p>
<p>"I wish it was our country that was putting this out right now," she says.</p> <p>As a patient advocate, she's frustrated that there isn't better research she can direct others to.</p> <p>"It's unfortunate because a lot of people are kind of just on their own," says Lenox Smith, who has used medical marijuana for nearly two decades to treat her own pain.</p> <p>Her condition, known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, has led to more than two dozen surgeries, including on her neck and spine. Still, a spoonful of her homemade cannabis oil gives her relief and helps her sleep through the night.</p> <p>UC Davis surgeon Richard Price thinks it's a reasonable option for his patients who are not getting an operation, though he'd like to see the findings from Europe replicated in the U.S., before he promotes cannabis more broadly.</p> <p>"It's really challenging to tell somebody, 'I know you're in pain, but there's nothing I can do for you, and a lot of patients do not want to go on opioids,'" he says.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Gaza ceasefire deal violated. And, shutdown enters day 20 with no end in sight</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p><em>Good morning. You're reading the Up First newsletter. </em>Subscribe<em> here to get it delivered to your inbox, and </em>listen<em> to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.</em></p> <h3 class="edTag">Today's top stories</h3> <p><strong>The ceasefire in Gaza was tested this weekend </strong>when Israel launched an assault on the territory in response to an attack on its troops. The Israeli military said Sunday that "terrorists" attacked Israeli troops operating in the Rafah area resulting in two soldiers being killed. Hamas denied involvement in any attacks. Gaza officials say dozens were killed in the Israeli strikes. Both sides are accusing the other of violating the ceasefire deal brokered by the United States.</p>
<ul class="edTag"><li>🎧 <strong>Yesterday's events mark the most significant threat to the ceasefire deal</strong> since both sides signed the agreement, NPR's Rob Schmitz tells<em> Up First.</em> Despite what happened, Hamas and Israel say they are still committed to the spirit of the ceasefire. U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, arrive in Israel today and Vice President JD Vance is expected to arrive tomorrow to get the ceasefire deal back on track. The group will try to facilitate the return of the remaining Israeli hostage bodies, which is an important part of the first phase of the agreement.</li></ul>
<p><strong>The government shutdown is entering day 20 </strong>with no serious negotiations underway to bring it to an end. The longest shutdown was 35 days and happened during Trump's first term in the White House. However, this time it is different as there is less pressure to get a deal because some of the impacts are not being widely felt, NPR's Deirdre Walsh says. <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>🎧 <strong>Instead of feeling pressure to fold due to their projects being targeted</strong>, Democrats are digging in and saying that this is more of the same tactics the Trump administration used before the shutdown happened. The Senate has unsuccessfully voted 10 times on a House-approved stopgap bill to fund the government. The next vote is expected tonight. Senate Democrats are expected to keep blocking that bill, not budging on their position that health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year need to be extended.</li></ul> <p><strong>The U.S. plans to stop all subsidies to Colombia and implement new tariffs after the country's leader</strong>, Gustavo Petro, said Trump's attacks on boats coming from Venezuela amount to murder. U.S. forces have destroyed boats in the open waters in what the government describes as a counternarcotics operation. <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>🎧<strong> The U.S. government says it has struck at least seven vessels</strong> and claims they were loaded with drugs headed to the U.S. NPR's Eyder Peralta says the big picture is that it has been decades since the U.S. military has taken a position like this in the Americas. This has created tension in the region. Renute Roberts, a fisherman in Trinidad, says he can hear drones circling at night. While Roberts says he believes drugs are a problem, he says Trump can handle it without bombing boats.</li></ul>

<p><em>NPR's series </em><em>Cost of Living: The Price We Pay</em><em> is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. </em></p> <p>U.S. health care is the most expensive in the developed world and the price point is only rising. Last year, the average annual premium for an employer-based health insurance plan for a family of four was over $25,500. Of that average total, employers contributed about $19,200 and workers contributed the rest. Total premiums have risen over 24% since 2019 and are widely expected to surge next year. Here's how the increasing costs are impacting people and companies: <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>⚕️ Drugmakers, hospitals, insurance companies and other for-profit companies have driven up the costs of accessing medical care in the U.S. For example, drugmakers are developing more effective medications, but they are charging a lot for them.</li><li>⚕️ For many of the millions of people who get health insurance through their employer, their paycheck deductions could surge next year by 6% to 7% on average.</li><li>⚕️ Some companies are covering all insurance premiums.

<p><em>Cumbia Across Latin America</em><em> is a visual report covering the people, places and cultures that keep this music genre alive in six countries.</em></p> <p>The first cumbia song recorded in Ecuador in the 1960s had just one verse and it was called "Cumbia Triste." Written by Polibio Mayorga, the song combined the rhythms of the San Juanito — traditional Andean music — with rural Colombian cumbia, which arrived to the country by way of the record industry. The result marked a new identity for many migrants who came to live in Ecuador's urban centers. Mayorga laid the groundwork for the Ecuadorian cumbia sound and musicians like Medardo Luzuriaga, who transformed the genre into a national sensation.

<p>Diwali, the festival of lights, will be celebrated around the world Monday, but steep tariffs on Indian goods made preparing for the holiday more costly for people living in the U.S.</p>

<p>LEILA FADEL, HOST: </p><p> Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and some Buddhists are celebrating Diwali today, the festival of lights. But this year, many living in the U.S. had their preparations complicated by tariffs. From member station WBHM in Birmingham, Alabama, Vahini Shori has more.</p><p>VAHINI SHORI, BYLINE: Shilpa Desai (ph) works at Jubilee Groceries in Vestavia Hills, Alabama. She's prepping for the busy holiday rush.</p><p>SHILPA DESAI: Everybody going to buy, like, diyas and sweets and all the groceries. And, like, you know, they're going to get prepared for the puja, like, a worship.</p><p>SHORI: But this year, steep tariffs on goods from India mean that the store has had to increase their prices on pretty much everything, even staple goods like wheat flour, peanut oil and rice.</p><p>DESAI: It is sad. Like, sooner or later, it's going to affect people, yeah.</p><p>SHORI: Desai is really worried about customers not being able to afford what they would normally buy for Diwali, which is also when many people here stock up for the year.</p><p>DESAI: It is hurt because that's our regular food. Middle class, they cannot afford. So sorry, I'm going to get tears. But, yeah, so that's hurt me, yeah.</p><p>SHORI: Now, some economists say that consumers may have to start evaluating which goods they must buy from India and which they can get cheaper from somewhere else. Layna Mosley is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University.</p><p>LAYNA MOSLEY: What they really do is undercut the efficiency that we have as a result of international trade, right? Our ability to buy rice that's grown in other countries, which is much cheaper, of course, than rice in the U.S., or our ability to buy a bunch of different varieties of rice depending on our preferences is really diminished when you have tariffs in place.</p><p>SHORI: And since these tariffs are so tied to U.S. foreign policy...</p><p>MOSLEY: I think that that suggests that many of these tariffs are kind of here to stay for quite some time, right? And, you know, we're still, I think, only beginning to see the economic impact of these tariffs.</p><p>SHORI: For now, consumers like Shilpa Desai are doing their best.</p><p>DESAI: And I normally cook my food at home.

<div class="article-title">As deadline for Trump's colleges compact looms, schools signal dissent</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Monday is the deadline for a handful of universities to agree to a list of commitments that align with the Trump administration's political priorities, in exchange for preferential access to federal funds.</p> <p>The Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education was sent on Oct. 1 to nine colleges — both private and public — and would require schools to bar transgender people from using restrooms or playing in sports that align with their gender identities, freeze tuition for five years, limit international student enrollment, and require standardized tests for admissions, among other things.</p> <p>Of the original nine schools that received the document, as of Sunday night, six had indicated they are not planning on signing.</p>
<p>MIT was the first school to issue a public statement: The document "includes principles with which we disagree," MIT President Sally Kornbluth wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon on Oct. 10. "And fundamentally the premise of the document is inconsistent with our core belief that scientific funding should be based on scientific merit alone."</p>
<p>Following that rejection, President Trump wrote on Truth Social that all colleges would be able to sign on, not just those that received the letter.</p> <p>Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California followed, with statements "respectfully" declining the offer.</p> <p>On Friday, the White House held a virtual meeting with colleges that hadn't yet sent rejection notices, including the University of Arizona, the University of Texas at Austin, Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia. Three additional schools were also invited: Arizona State University, Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Kansas, according to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.</p> <p>"Today's conversation with national higher education leaders is an important step toward defining a shared vision, and we look forward to continued discussions in the weeks ahead," McMahon wrote on X after the meeting. She said attendees had a "positive and wide-ranging conversation about the Compact."</p>
<p>But following that meeting, two schools, the University of Virginia and Dartmouth College, announced they also would not be signing on to the agreement. Dartmouth President Sian Leah Beilock said in a letter to students and faculty on Saturday that she did not think "a compact — with any administration — is the right approach to achieve academic excellence."</p> <p>UVA said it wanted "no special treatment" when it comes to federal funding.</p> <p>"A contractual arrangement predicating assessment on anything other than merit will undermine the integrity of vital, sometimes lifesaving, research and further erode confidence in American higher education," wrote Paul Mahoney, the interim president of UVA. He said the university had provided the administration with comments and that the university agreed with many of the principles laid out in the compact.</p>
<p>UVA's previous president resigned this summer under pressure from the Trump administration over the university's response to President Trump's order to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p> <p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday on its plans for the compact going forward. An automated emailed response said there were staff shortages due to the government shutdown and blamed Democrats.</p> <p>Since Trump took office, the administration has canceled billions of dollars in federal research grants at many universities over a number of issues, including transgender policies, diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and antisemitism on campus.</p>
