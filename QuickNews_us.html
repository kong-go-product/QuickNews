<div class="article-title">Lionel Richie reveals he almost became a priest before one fan's comment changed his life</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Lionel Richie revealed that he almost joined the Episcopal priesthood before one encouraging shoutout from an audience member convinced him to pursue a musical career. </p><p>In his new memoir "Truly," the 76-year-old music icon recalled growing up, he was a "disastrously shy altar boy" who considered becoming a member of the clergy and was training for the priesthood.</p><p>During a Friday appearance on "Today with Jenna &amp; Friends" to promote his tell-all, Richie recalled the pivotal moment, while performing with his college band, The Commodores, that inspired him to commit to music. </p><p>"I couldn’t figure out what the heck to do with my life, couldn’t figure it out," the four-time Grammy Award winner said. "I’m as shy as I can be. And then I realized, maybe the priesthood might be the best way to go."</p><p>"Here’s what happened to change my mind," Richie continued. "I joined the Commodores in my second semester of my sophomore year and something amazing happened. A lady on the front row of some club said, ‘Sing it, baby!’"</p><p>Richie said that the audience member's comment prompted him to contact church leadership and abandon his training for the priesthood.</p><p>"I called back to the priest and I said, ‘I don’t think I’m going to be college material. I just gotta be honest with you,’" the "All Night Long" hitmaker said. "There’s a moment when you have that moment."</p><p>"All of a sudden, I got an acknowledgment from the other side," Richie continued. "From that point on, I kept thinking, now how does this go forward? I didn't know I was a writer, didn't know I was a singer. Thank God for The Commodores because I would have never discovered Lionel Richie."</p><p>Richie admitted that he continued to struggle with his shyness while he was performing with The Commodores. </p><p>"Scared to death, can you imagine having panic attacks on stage?" the "American Idol" judge said. "But I wanted to be in this band so badly, and I wanted to be in this business." </p><p>In "Truly," Richie recalled telling the priests at his church that he had second thoughts about his vocation for the priesthood.  </p><p>"They gave me wise words of encouragement and told me that if things changed the door was always open," Richie wrote. "In fact, in the coming years, whenever I worried that the music thing was to be short-lived, I’d talk about returning to my earlier plans." </p><p>He continued, "I even picked out a seminary in Wyoming. Never went. The moment of truth probably arrived when I began to write songs—and realized they were my real sermons.</p><p>"Truly" will be released nationwide on Oct. 15, 2025, through HarperCollins.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Final respects paid to forgotten Catholics of 300 years ago who valued religious liberty: See the photos</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Maryland officials reinterred 65 of the state's earliest settlers in a powerful ceremony more than 300 years after the settlers' first burials.</p><p>The reinterment was held at Historic St. Mary's City, a colonial town off the western shore of Chesapeake Bay, on Sept. 20. Earlier this year, the site drew national headlines when it opened up a reconstructed 17th-century Catholic church. </p><p>The Brick Chapel was the center of Catholic worship in Maryland until 1704, when the Protestant governor of Maryland shuttered the building's doors. </p><p>The recent reinterment marked the chapel’s most meaningful use yet. Henry Miller, Ph.D., a senior research fellow at Historic St. Mary's City, spoke to Fox News Digital about the observance.</p><p>Sept. 20 marked the day the 65 individuals were finally returned to a new burial vault after their remains had been respectfully studied and preserved.</p><p>The event, attended by Archbishop of Baltimore William E. Lori, included a procession, a chapel blessing and the reburial.</p><p>Miller painstakingly planned all the period-accurate details, he said, such as the horse-drawn hearse, the cannon salute and the inclusion of "Salve Regina," a hymn that settlers would have known well.</p><p>"Having the archbishop was important, as these [settlers] were almost all Catholics," he said. </p><p>"The parts were all planned to create a dignified, memorable and honorable ceremony to return these people to their resting place."</p><p>Miller said it took six hours to place all the remains in the vault.To save time, the public ceremony focused on what he called "the most forgotten" — the babies left out of historical records.</p><p>"We placed the remains of eight of them in small black boxes wrapped with black ribbon and a sprig of rosemary attached," he said. "They were in the coffin [we carried]." </p><p>He went on, "I found eight pallbearers who are descendants of 17th-century Maryland immigrants …. Once the coffin was brought into the chapel with an honor guard, the archbishop blessed their remains, and each pallbearer was given a box to carry to the burial vault for interment."</p><p>Miller added, "I named the pallbearer and their ancestor, and then said what we could about the little baby they were holding." </p><p>All of the details, down to the coffin, were as accurate and respectful as possible, he said.</p><p>"The coffin itself is a precise reconstruction of one we excavated at the site," Miller said. "We also carefully measured the locations and orientations of all the nails and the soil stains from the coffin wood, so that it was possible to fully and accurately reconstruct it.</p><p>"My goal was to honor these long-forgotten men, women and children, showing them dignity and respect at the place they had been buried over three centuries ago," he added. </p><p>Miller also said, "As an archaeologist who helped excavate them, I felt both a professional and personal obligation to see them properly reinterred. It was the proper and respectful way to treat them."</p><p>Before the burial, researchers studied the remains and gleaned insights on everything from chronic illnesses and dental care to lead ingestion and diet in colonial America — something that Miller says will be the subject of a future book.</p><p>He also said the event could serve as a model for how excavated remains are treated elsewhere in the U.S., noting that respecting ancestors "is a deeply seated human tradition."</p><p>"I feel we honored them as the founders of Maryland, and as individuals who sacrificed much to do that, giving up all they knew to try for a new life in an unfamiliar land," he said. </p><p>"All of them have been forgotten for centuries, except by a few historians, and this has allowed us to return them to memory."</p><p>Beyond Maryland's history, the archaeologist also used the event to deliver a national message about tolerance and coexistence.</p><p>The call came just 10 days after Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was shot in Utah, a stark reminder of how political violence continues to divide the U.S.</p><p>"[Marylanders] learned that people with different viewpoints can live together without violence," Miller said in his speech. "That is a legacy as important in late 2025 as it was in the 1600s."</p><p>Overall, Miller said that St. Mary's City should be recognized as much as Jamestown and Plymouth, considering the colonial settlement's role in pioneering religious liberty.</p><p>"These people set the precedent in North America, beginning in 1634, for a core part of the American experience as expressed in the First Amendment, [meaning] no established church and the free exercise of religion," he said. "The first North American introduction of these ideas happened at St. Mary's City."</p><p>"That should place St. Mary's on a par with Jamestown and Plymouth as founding places of the American experience."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">‘Consumed with hate’: Winsome Sears, Jason Miyares unload on Democrat Jay Jones over violent texts</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears delivered a blistering one-two punch this weekend, saying Democratic AG candidate Jay Jones has disqualified himself from office after texts emerged in which he wished for the death of a Republican rival’s children.The coordinated condemnations marked the most aggressive escalation yet in a controversy that has thrown Virginia politics into a fever pitch heading into the nationally watched 2025 election.</p><p>"Jay Jones has shown he’s reckless, biased, and willing to trade away his integrity," Miyares wrote in an open letter to Virginians, posted to social media late Saturday. "This conduct is disqualifying."</p><p>Hours later, Sears took the stage to deliver remarks and accused Democrats of being "consumed with hate."</p><p>"The enemy is among us, devouring us in Virginia and in America today," Sears said in a fiery speech. "Jay Jones fantasizes about murdered little children lying lifeless in their mother’s arms. And yet he runs for attorney general, our chief law enforcement officer."</p><p>The uproar followed the publication of private 2022 text messages in which Jones, then a rising Democrat star, said he hoped former Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert’s children would die. When challenged, Jones doubled down, saying that such grief might be "a good thing" if it advanced his politics.</p><p>Jones has since apologized, calling the remarks "embarrassing and shameful," and said he had reached out personally to Gilbert and his family.</p><p>But Virginia Republicans said the damage is irreversible. Miyares, who has served as attorney general since 2022, wrote that as a prosecutor he has "sat with crying victims and grieving families" and heard "the cries of a parent who has lost a child." He said no one, "least of all a candidate for Virginia’s top law-enforcement office, should ever treat such pain as a political tool."</p><p>Miyares’ letter put the race's stakes in plain language. "If you believe it is okay to wish death upon a political opponent — vote for my opponent," he wrote. "If you believe it is worth the death of children to advance your political goals — vote for my opponent. If you want to give a green light to violent lunatics — vote for my opponent."</p><p>The attorney general said his own oath of office obligates him to protect every Virginian, "regardless of whether they are a Democrat or Republican." He added: "I cannot imagine someone running for this job who advocates for violence."</p><p>Sears broadened her criticism beyond Jones, tying his comments to a culture of what she called Democrat "rage politics." </p><p>"The leadership of the Democrat Party is inciting violence as a strategy to win power," Sears said. She noted that gubernatorial candidate Rep. Abigail Spanberger urged her supporters to "let your rage fill you."</p><p>"Well, words have meaning," Sears continued. "Rage is defined as violent, uncontrolled anger." She warned Virginians to take notice, citing past threats and attacks on Republicans nationwide, from the 2022 attempt on Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s life to school shootings targeting Christians.</p><p>"The unstable pull the triggers," Sears added, "but they are inspired by the hate tolerated and encouraged by the leadership of the Democrat Party."</p><p>Both Republicans framed the controversy as a turning point in the 2025 election. </p><p>"Prior to this week, this race was about competing views on public safety," Miyares wrote. "Now it’s about basic fitness for public office."</p><p>Sears closed her speech with a plea for unity and faith: "As an immigrant, I have seen what happens when leftists destroy the foundations of freedom." </p><p>"Let each of us act to protect our beloved Commonwealth of Virginia and the gift from God that is the United States of America," Sears concluded.</p><p>Fox News Digital did not receive responses on requests for comment from Sears, Miyares or Jones at the time of publication.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Greg Norman, Danielle Wallace and Charles Creitz contributed to this report.</i> </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Man dies in likely bear attack at Arkansas campsite days after sending photos of animal to family</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Missouri man was found dead from a likely bear attack this week, just two days after he sent photos to his family of a bear at his campsite in Arkansas, according to officials. </p><p>Police found the 60-year-old man’s body several hundred yards from his campsite near Mt. Judea, Arkansas, on Thursday. The area showed signs of a struggle and had drag marks away from the camp.</p><p>The man's son had asked for a welfare check because his dad hadn’t checked in for a couple of days since sending the photos.  </p><p>His body has "extensive" injuries "consistent with those expected from a large carnivore attack," the Newton County Sheriff’s Department said in a release. </p><p>Search efforts were still underway on Saturday to find the bear, which appeared to be a young male, according to the photos sent by the man. Officials said they weren't sure the bear in the photos was the one that attacked. </p><p>"Until the Arkansas Crime Lab completes the autopsy, we can't 100% say it was a bear, but everything strongly indicates it," Sheriff Glenn Wheeler said in a statement. "We are attempting to find the bear and dispose of it so the Game and Fish Commission can test it for anything that may have led to the encounter."</p><p>He added, "We know without a doubt that a bear was in camp with our victim and the injuries absolutely are consistent with a bear attack. This is a highly unusual case. We are very early in the investigation and search and will update as we can. If you are in the area, just be aware and use caution, especially with children. History tells us that once a bear becomes predatory, it often continues those behaviors."</p><p>The campground, known as Sam's Throne, has been temporarily closed to the public while the search for the bear continues. Wheeler warned people to be vigilant while enjoying the outdoors: keep food away from where you sleep, don’t approach bears even if they’re small and carry bear spray or some other way to defend yourself. </p><p>"I don't want this to become open season on any bear that someone may see, as most bears fear humans and run away," Wheeler added. "But, at the same time, don't put yourself or others in jeopardy."</p><p>This would be the second bear attack in the state in a month if confirmed. </p><p>A 72-year-old Arkansas man was mauled by a black bear in early September. He later died of his injuries. </p><p>Before that, the last fatal bear attack in Arkansas was in 1892, according to the Arkansas Times. </p><p>"I don’t even know how to put it into words, to tell you the truth. These things just don’t happen," Keith Stephens, the chief of communications for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, told the newspaper. "It just seems so bizarre. It’s not even in my realm of comprehension. I’m really in shock today. Actually, when I was told about it, I thought they were kidding me just to give me a hard time from the last one. It’s obviously not a joking matter, but it just didn’t seem real." </p><p>The bear in the first attack was previously euthanized. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A judge on Saturday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from sending underage migrants to adult detention centers once they turn 18. </p><p>U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras said the new policy violates an order he issued in 2021 that instructed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement not to send any migrant to an ICE detention center after they turn 18. </p><p>Underage migrants aren’t held in ICE detention centers. They’re held in centers run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. </p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to ICE for comment. </p><p>The Trump administration is now offering teen migrants a $2,500 stipend to leave the United States voluntarily, according to several reports citing a letter sent Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement to shelters housing migrant children.</p><p>Several immigration rights groups had asked Contreras to intervene in the filing made just after midnight Saturday morning. </p><p>Last month, another judge blocked the Trump administration from deporting certain Guatemalan minors to their home country after the government walked back claims that it intended to reunite the youths with their parents.</p><p>Judge Timothy Kelly, who issued the order, said the Trump administration could not show that any parents wanted their children back.</p><p>"That explanation crumbled like a house of cards about a week later," Kelly wrote in his order. "There is no evidence before the Court that the parents of these children sought their return."</p><p>Michelle Lapointe, a lawyer for the American Immigration Council, one of the organizations involved in the filing, told The Associated Press, "All of these are pieces of the same general policy to coerce immigrant youth into giving up their right to seek protection in the United States." </p><p>Migrant children in the U.S. are often released into foster care or to family members as long as they’re not considered a flight risk or a danger. </p><p>Lawyers for some of the migrants said they heard that ICE was telling shelters that children turning 18 would be taken to ICE detention centers even if they already had plans to be released and that they could only be released on a case-by-case basis for "urgent humanitarian reasons" or "significant public benefit."</p><p><i>Fox News' Ashley Oliver and Michael Dorgan and The Associated Press contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

Some lost their sight or fell into comas after drinking famous Brazilian caipirinhas, vodka tonics and other clear cocktails.</p><p>"I’m definitely not going out to drink this weekend. Things are worrying," said Rafael Martinez, a 30-year-old architect in São Paulo. "For now, I’d rather stick to soda or, at most, beer, which they said is harder to tamper with."</p><p>Health Minister Alexandre Padilha urged Brazilians to "steer clear of colorless spirits" and announced new emergency measures, including the purchase of 2,500 doses of fomepizole, an antidote for methanol poisoning, and 12,000 ampoules of medical-grade ethanol. Shipments began Saturday to five states as the government races to prevent more deaths.</p><p>According to the ministry, most cases are in São Paulo though cases have surfaced as far as Pernambuco and Mato Grosso do Sul. Padilha said the new stockpile would ensure "no patient goes without treatment" and that both antidotes can be administered even before lab confirmation.</p><p>Federal police are investigating a potential link to organized crime groups accused of distributing counterfeit liquor.</p><p>Methanol is an industrial chemical that can cause nerve and liver damage and is sometimes found in fake or poorly distilled alcohol.</p><p>Restaurant owners are suspending liquor sales to reassure nervous customers. </p><p>"Last night no one bought drinks … even I don’t want to drink," said Nikolaos Loukopoulos, who runs a Greek restaurant in São Paulo.

Why risk it?"</p><p>Tourist hot spot Rio de Janeiro has not recorded any confirmed cases, but beach kiosks and restaurants have posted warnings on social media to calm visitors.</p><p>Thais Flores, a 28-year-old dental surgeon visiting Rio from São Paulo, said she reluctantly ordered a Corona at a beach kiosk. </p><p>"I don’t really like beer, but because of the latest news, it’s been my drink of choice."</p><p>Her friend, Raquel Marques, 29, said she risked drinking a vodka caipirinha anyway. </p><p>"I’m scared, but we took a chance," she said. "The guy said he bought it at the market."</p><p>The scare comes as Brazil prepares for its peak tourism season, raising fears of an economic hit to its beaches and nightlife industry.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A U.S. District Court on Saturday issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) to halt the Trump administration from deploying 200 National Guardsmen to Portland, Oregon, amid violent anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) protests.</p><p>The lawsuit, brought by the State of Oregon and City of Portland, argued the deployment was unlawful, exceeding the president’s statutory and constitutional authority.</p><p>Judge Karin Immergut, appointed by President Donald Trump in 2019, granted the TRO blocking the federal action.</p><p>Trump in June issued a memorandum authorizing the federalization of National Guard troops, citing threats to federal employees and property during protests against immigration enforcement. </p><p>While violence was reported near a Portland ICE facility in June, the state alleged that, by late summer, protests had become small and largely peaceful.</p><p>On Sept. 27, Trump announced via Truth Social he was directing Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to deploy troops to "war-ravaged Portland" to protect against "Antifa and other domestic terrorists" and authorized "full force, if necessary." </p><p>The following day, Hegseth ordered the federalization of 200 Oregon National Guard members over the objection of Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who insisted there was no public safety emergency. </p><p>Despite increasing violence and numerous arrests, the State of Oregon and the City of Portland filed suit, arguing that the deployment was unlawful and unconstitutional.</p><p>Immergut ruled Saturday that Trump's federalization order exceeded his authority because the law only allows the president to call in the National Guard under exceptional circumstances, including invasion, rebellion or an inability to execute federal law using regular forces.</p><p>The court found none of those conditions existed in Oregon, determining that local and federal law enforcement were capable of maintaining order. </p><p>Further, because Immergut ruled Trump acted outside statutory limits, she found the order also violated the 10th Amendment by infringing on Oregon’s sovereign right to control its own National Guard. </p><p>In addressing irreparable harm, Immergut said the state faced constitutional injury from loss of control over its Guard, operational harm from diversion of troops trained for state emergencies and public safety risks.</p><p>The court held the public interest favored restraint, emphasizing the importance of maintaining civilian control and avoiding military intrusion.</p><p>"This country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs," Immergut wrote in her decision. "This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law."</p><p>In granting the TRO, the court blocked the federalization and deployment of National Guard troops to Portland. </p><p>The order will remain in effect for 14 days, until Oct. 18, unless extended. </p><p>Immergut also denied the government’s request to stay or pause the order. </p><p>Sandy Chung, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon, released a statement applauding the judge's ruling, noting it is "consistent with the law and the facts on the ground in Portland."</p><p>"Not only would deployment of our state’s National Guard members waste up to $10 million in taxpayer dollars, there is simply no basis to deploy troops into Portland," Chung wrote. "The President’s attempt to do so is a dangerous abuse of power, and very disrespectful of our state, its people, and our National Guard service members."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">WNBA commissioner's past comments on Caitlin Clark's earnings resurface after her denial of alleged remarks</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert's previous comments about league and Indiana Fever superstar Caitlin Clark's earning potential during a CNBC interview resurfaced on social media Friday.</p><p>The previous comments came to light after Engelbert denied telling Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier that Clark "should be grateful she makes $16 million off the court because without the platform that the WNBA gives her, she wouldn't make anything," according to Collier.</p><p>While Engelbert denied making that statement during a news conference Friday, her previous comments during an interview at the CNBC Changemakers Summit in April 2024 echoed similar themes.</p><p>"Caitlin has the ability to make up to a half-million dollars just in WNBA wages this year. So, of course, they’re just looking at a base which is collectively bargained. And, actually, it’s low because she’s the No. 1 pick. She’ll make a little more than that," Engelbert said.</p><p>"She also has millions and millions of dollars [in] endorsements. Because she declared to become pro, her endorsements are higher in dollar value. She has a global platform now, not just a U.S. platform. So, she’s going to do just fine as will the top players in the league as every league does."</p><p>Engelbert's made the comments just days after Clark was selected with the No. 1 pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft by the Fever. Clark's WNBA base salary that year was just $76,535. </p><p>Clark did sign an eight-year, $28 million deal with Nike that she signed in April 2024, before she ever played a game in the WNBA. And she had previous deals with Nike and other sponsors during her college career at Iowa.</p><p>The commissioner faced immense backlash from fans, media pundits and active players after Collier made the allegations that Engelbert said Clark should be "grateful" and "wouldn't make anything" without the WNBA last week, which Collier said came in a private conversation.</p><p>Collier also alleged Engelbert told her, "Players should be on their knees, thanking their lucky stars for the media rights deal that I got them."</p><p>While addressing the alleged comments about Clark, Engelbert denied making them.</p><p>"Obviously, I did not make those comments. Caitlin has been a transformational player in this league. She's been a great representative of the game. She’s brought in tens of millions of new fans to the game," Engelbert said at Friday's news conference.</p><p>However, Engelbert did not explicitly deny making the alleged comments about players that "should be on their knees." Instead, the commissioner responded by claiming there have been a lot of "inaccuracies" reported in the media.</p><p>"There's a lot of inaccuracy out there through social media and all this reporting," Engelbert said. "A lot of reporting, a lot of innacuracy about what I say, what I didn't say."</p><p>Engelbert later said, "I'm disheartened. I'm a human too. I have a family. I have two kids who are devastated by these comments. So, all I say is that it's obviously been a tough week, and I just think there's a lot of innacuracy out there."</p><p>Still, Engelbert acknowledged that if players don't feel "appreciated," she has "to do better."</p><p>"I was disheartened to hear that some players feel the league and that I personally do not care about them or listen to them," Engelbert said before Game 1 of the WNBA Finals Friday night.</p><p>"If the players in the ‘W’ don’t feel appreciated and value from the league, we have to do better, and I have to do better."</p><p>The WNBA and its players' union, the WNBPA, are in negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement.</p><p>The players’ association and the WNBA agreed to an eight-year agreement in 2020, but the WNBPA voted last eyar to opt out of the agreement early. The current agreement expires Oct. 31. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Elvira is standing by her criticism of Ariana Grande almost a year after calling out the "Wicked" star for her allegedly rude behavior during a past encounter. </p><p>The 74-year-old horror icon, whose real name is Cassandra Peterson, previously accused Grande, 32, of snubbing her during one of her "Mistress of the Dark" shows. </p><p>Grande later apologized, saying she didn’t recall the encounter and attributed it to an anxiety attack she was experiencing at the time.</p><p>During a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Peterson doubled down on her version of events and shared her reaction to Grande's apology. </p><p>"I told a story that really happened. She did it. I wasn't making it up. It was very offensive," Peterson said.</p><p>"I had all the celebrities who I had ever come to my show — and there was a ton — were always gracious and kind, and, um, she was not. I'm sorry to say that.</p><p>"It's disappointing when you hear things like that and learn things like that," Elvira added. "It's sad. But, oh well."</p><p>In October 2024, Peterson first spoke publicly about her encounter with Grande, adding fuel to long-running "diva" rumors surrounding the singer.</p><p>During an appearance at Knott's Scary Farm, Elvira participated in a Q&amp;A session in which she asked about her worst celebrity interaction. </p><p>In a fan-recorded video, Peterson, who made her character "Elvira" famous beginning in the early '80s, recalled meeting Grande but didn't disclose when the interaction occurred.</p><p>Peterson said Grande "came [to my show], and she brought 20 guests. So, she wanted 21 tickets. We're like, ‘OK,’" Peterson started. "She gets backstage, and she asks if I could take pictures with all of her friends and relatives she brought.</p><p>"I take a picture with every single one of them. I sign autographs for every single one of them," Peterson explained. "Then I say to her, ‘Could we take a photo together,’ and she goes, ‘No, I don't really do that.'</p><p>"And then she left before my show started. All her relatives stayed."</p><p>Peterson later posted a screenshot to Instagram featuring an article written about the conflict. A day later, Grande left a comment on the post, expressing her remorse for the interaction. </p><p>"I’m so disheartened to see this. i actually don’t even remember getting the chance to meet you because i had an anxiety attack and to my memory, left before the rest of my family (this was around 7 years ago and at the time i was really not great with being in public crowds or loud places)… but if i’m misremembering this moment, i sincerely apologize for offending you so," Grande wrote at the time. </p><p>"Thank you for being so nice to my mom, she told me how lovely you were (she might have different feelings about that now but i’ll talk to her… clearly, we all have our days!) sending love always. you’ll always be our queen of halloween!"</p><p>While speaking with Entertainment Weekly, Peterson shared that she wasn't impressed with the "We Can't Be Friends" singer's apology, pointing to the line about how "her mom used to really like me, but maybe not now."  </p><p>"What's the word? You know, where you do something, but you really have other thoughts in mind? Like, 'Thank you, not really, thank you,'" Peterson said. </p><p>The "Yours Cruelly, Elvira" star told Entertainment Weekly she and Grande haven't spoken since the Grammy Award winner's apology. </p><p>"After that response from her, no, I just let the whole thing drop," Peterson said. </p><p>Peterson expressed her hope that Grande might learn humility from the experience. </p><p>"I think when you're young, and you're in show business — well, if you last in show business for any amount of time and are still famous — you do learn a lot of lessons along the way, and you get a little more humble," she said. "So, hopefully, that will happen with her."</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to representatives for Grande and Peterson for comment. </p><p>Grande has previously spoken out about being accused of diva behavior. </p><p>In May 2020, Grande appeared on Apple Music's "Zane Lowe Show," and spoke about how she was affected by the media's narrative of her.</p><p>"I stopped doing interviews for a really long time because I felt like whenever I would get into a position where somebody would try to say something for clickbait or twist my words or blah-blah-blah. I would defend myself and then people would be like, ‘Oh, she’s a diva.' And I was like, ‘This doesn’t make any sense.'"</p><p>Grande pointed out that women in her position are often spoken about differently than men. </p><p>"It makes you want to quiet down a little bit. But I'm trying to also say, ‘F--- that.’</p><p>"I'm tired of seeing women silenced by it. I think there's this thing where, like, we'll hear something or [someone will be] like, ‘Oh she said this.’ … It really sits with you. And you feel like, ‘Oh wow, should I not express myself anymore, or should I not have this fight that I want to have anymore? … Should I just say, ‘OK’ and let it be? It kind of f---s you up a little bit."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The federal judge who sentenced the defendant found guilty of attempting to assassinate U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is being criticized by conservatives on social media for the length of the sentence and concerns about Nicholas Roske, who goes by Sophie, identifying as transgender.</p><p>Judge Deborah Boardman, a Biden appointee, sentenced Roske to eight years in prison Friday for attempting to assassinate Kavanaugh in June 2022 in the weeks before the Supreme Court’s landmark Dobbs decision.</p><p>The sentence is more lenient than what the Department of Justice (DOJ) had sought. Prosecutors said Roske should face at least 30 years, while Roske's defense team had asked for eight.</p><p>Boardman said during a sentencing hearing that while Roske's actions were "reprehensible," she also considered a string of mitigating factors, including that Roske "spontaneously confessed to and cooperated with police."</p><p>"Maryland U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman—a Biden appointee—is a national disgrace," Mike Davis, a conservative lawyer and strategist and former chief counsel for nominations to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, wrote on X on Friday. </p><p>"She only sentenced to 8 years, instead of 30, someone who attempted to murder Justice Kavanaugh and his family in their home. Make no mistake: Today’s Democrats want conservatives killed."</p><p>Another person wrote that Boardman "needs to be removed from the bench right the f--- now," then shared a screenshot of another post mentioning that Boardman asked if Roske would be sent to a women’s prison. </p><p>Author M.A. Rothman called the sentence "pathetic."</p><p>"A guy who showed up at a Supreme Court Justice’s house armed and ready to k*ll him just got a lighter sentence than some people get for tax crimes — and the judge turned it into a trans acceptance story," he added. "This is beyond parody. The DOJ wanted 30 years. He got 8. And the media barely blinked." </p><p>Another person on X balked at Boardman considering the "fact that he now identifies as a woman into giving him a lower sentence."</p><p>The DOJ plans to appeal the sentence, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on Friday. </p><p>"The attempted assassination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was a disgusting attack against our entire judicial system by a profoundly disturbed individual," she wrote on X. "@TheJusticeDept will be appealing the woefully insufficient sentence imposed by the district court, which does not reflect the horrific facts of this case." </p><p>Boardman was appointed as a U.S. magistrate judge for the District of Maryland in 2019, until she was nominated by former President Joe Biden to be a U.S. district judge. She was confirmed by the Senate in 2021. She previously worked as a public defender.  </p><p><i>Fox News' Ashley Oliver and Jake Gibson contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Washington Post editorial board slammed New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani Friday for "holding back gifted students in the name of equity" following his proposal to phase out gifted education programs in the city.</p><p>"Who could have guessed that Zohran Mamdani (D), the leading candidate to become the next New York mayor, would provoke a firestorm by announcing this week that he intends to phase out the city’s early elementary school programs for gifted students in the name of equity? Parents of bright children want access to schooling that meets their needs?" The Post questioned. "Shocking."</p><p>In response to a New York Times questionnaire on Thursday, the mayoral hopeful revealed his plans to eliminate gifted programs for public school children in NYC until they enter third grade.</p><p>The headline for the Post's editorial read, "Holding back gifted students in the name of equity." </p><p>The city's current program allows students to enter these gifted programs starting in kindergarten after they have been nominated by their preschool teachers and meet other criteria based on their grades.</p><p>As noted by The Post, the city's gifted student program has long faced criticism from those on the left who argue that the program exacerbates segregation in the city's school system.</p><p>"Students who come from higher-income families are at an advantage of being selected, resulting in a disproportionate number of White and Asian kids. Black and Hispanic kids, who comprise 66 percent of total enrollment, make up only 21 percent of participants in these programs," the outlet reported.</p><p>The Post was critical of Mamdani and other school systems that have made similar changes to their gifted student programs for not appreciating the fact that "gifted children have different learning needs from their peers, just as children with cognitive disabilities benefit from education plans that are specific to them."</p><p>"Parents see the gifted programs as stepping stones toward high-achieving schools down the road. But the solution is not to take away opportunities from children who are currently benefiting from them; it is to expand the program and improve how the city identifies children from underserved populations," the outlet argued.</p><p>In closing, The Post warned that politicians "tread on dangerous ground when their pursuit of equity comes at the cost of children’s opportunities."</p><p>This isn’t the first time The Post’s editorial board has warned about Mamdani’s potential impact on NYC if he were to be elected.</p><p>In June, The Post argued Mamdani's socialist policies could bring the city back to the "bad old days" and "discredit" the next generation of Democratic leaders.</p><p>"New Yorkers should be worried that he would lead Gotham back to the bad old days of civic dysfunction, and Democrats should fear that he will discredit their next generation of party leaders, almost all of whom are better than this democratic socialist," The Post cautioned.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Mamdani's campaign for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

The song is filled with clever references, each serving as an Easter egg for fans who know their Hollywood history. </p><p>"That view of Portofino was on my mind," Swift sings in a nod to Taylor’s romance with Richard Burton, who famously proposed in the Italian village in 1964.</p><p>"I’d cry my eyes violet," she croons, a direct reference to Taylor’s famous violet eyes, which were as legendary as her love life.The line "I would trade the Cartier for someone to trust" may have struck a deeper chord with fans.</p><p>Taylor’s celebrated Cartier jewels have long symbolized her high-profile romances, but Swift turns the comparison around, asking whether all that glitter can ever replace trust and real connection.There’s also a shoutout to Musso &amp; Frank Grill, a Hollywood landmark where Taylor often dined, and a nod to Taylor’s signature fragrance, "White Diamonds," with the lyric, "All my white diamonds and lovers are forever."</p><p>Fans received a message from Swift during the "Official Release Party of a Showgirl," Oct. 3, when she introduced the track in a prerecorded message, according to Elle.Swift called it "one of my favorite songs" from the album and said it explores "the anxiety provoked by fickle fame" — a feeling both Taylors knew well.</p><p>The Grammy winner’s new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," also includes a nod to her high-profile relationship with NFL star Travis Kelce.On the track "Wood," Swift hints at finding "the one" after years of heartbreak.</p><p>"Girls, I don’t need to catch a bouquet / To know a hard rock is on the way… The curse on me was broken by your magic wand / Seems to me that you and me, we make our own luck."</p><p>She even references Kelce’s popular podcast, "New Heights."</p><p>"New heights of manhood / I ain’t gotta knock on wood," she sings on the track.</p><p>In August, the couple announced their major relationship milestone on Instagram with the caption, "Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married."</p><p>In the series of sweet photos the pop superstar shared, Kelce was down on one knee as Swift caressed his face during the intimate moment.</p><p>The "Love Story" singer began dating Kelce in 2023.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Authorities in Arizona have arrested and charged a man in the shooting deaths of two teenagers found in a remote area earlier this year.</p><p>Thomas Brown, 31, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of high school students Evan Clark, 17, and Pandora Kjolsrud, 18, the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office announced Thursday.</p><p>"Murder is one of the most heinous crimes that can be brought on a person and their family," Maricopa County Sheriff's Office Capt. David Lee said at a press conference Friday. "In a way, it's the ultimate theft."</p><p>The teenagers were found dead May 27 near Mount Ord in the Tonto National Forest, north of Mesa, after law enforcement received a report that they had not returned from a camping trip.</p><p>"The complainant advised [the Gila County Sheriff's Office] that her daughter was out camping with friends, and her last known location was on Mount Ord," Lee said. "The complainant also provided pictures for us of her daughter's camping trip, which she had received."</p><p>In the weeks following the discovery, detectives received numerous tips, including from other campers who said they saw a man behaving "very strangely."</p><p>When questioned, Brown allegedly told investigators he had been camping on Mount Ord with his wife and said he had also been flying a drone and had encountered a young male and female matching the victims’ description.</p><p>However, investigators allege Brown’s account was inconsistent with the evidence they had collected.</p><p>"Thomas Brown provided false and misleading information regarding his involvement," Lee said. </p><p>Brown was arrested and booked into the Maricopa County jail. He did not turn himself in voluntarily, and there is no evidence suggesting that Brown knew either victim before the killings, according to Lee.</p><p>"They were, as far as we know, complete strangers," Lee said. </p><p>At Friday’s news conference, Pandora Kjolsrud’s mother, Simone Kjolsrud, described her daughter as "a beautiful, brilliant light in this world."</p><p>"We are all devastated, and we miss her every day," Simone Kjolsrud said. "All of life's beauty feels less bright without her here, but the light and love and beauty she gave us will be in our hearts forever.

<div class="article-title">Comedy star admits he was ‘completely devastated’ by Kirk murder, calls outrage over Kimmel hypocritical</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Veteran comedian Jamie Kennedy said he was "completely devastated" by the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk despite never having met him.</p><p>The "Malibu’s Most Wanted" and "Scream" star and host of the "Hate to Break It to Ya" podcast told Fox News Digital he was shocked not only by the killing of Kirk but by the reactions of people who celebrated his death. </p><p>"And then just to see [the killing] was just, you know, it was beyond shocking. So, that was one level. And then to see people's reactions to it was just – it was just beyond sick. It was just beyond evil, sick, disgusting, and that really messed me up," Kennedy said.</p><p>Like many Americans, the actor and stand-up comic said Kirk’s death Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University hit him "on the deepest of levels."</p><p>"I've never been so sad and so mad about someone that I never met. And I was completely, I was just completely devastated by this," he said to Fox News Digital.</p><p>Kennedy said he struggled to comprehend that the killing happened during a free speech event on a college campus.</p><p>"Why? Why did this happen? Like, where are we at? If you go onto a college campus, right, a place that's supposed to be the epitome of open ideas, OK? And then you go there, and then you're gunned down for a speech."</p><p>He said seeing people celebrate his killing revealed to him the "newest low" in human behavior and made him realize how divided things really are in America.</p><p>"But then to see people celebrating it, that's just a newest low. And I don't remember seeing this in my 55 years. … So, it changed me because I don't want to be around anybody like that. I don't want to be near anybody like that. I want to be in my own area with people that share my ideas, my values, and let people that share those ideas and those values over there."</p><p>Despite the shock and horror he felt over Kirk’s assassination, Kennedy pointed to the positive response, which included memorials and religious services held not only in the U.S. but around the world.</p><p>He called the positive response to Kirk’s death "the greatest advertisement for Jesus ever."</p><p>He pointed to the power of Kirk’s wife, Erika Kirk, forgiving her husband’s murderer at his memorial in Arizona.</p><p>"When his wife forgave the murderer, that is literally, she is the living embodiment of Jesus' message. … That was the ultimate forgiveness. I couldn't believe that she did that," he said. "It was the most beautiful act of forgiveness we've ever witnessed."</p><p>While talking to Fox News Digital, Kennedy weighed in on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" host Jimmy Kimmel being suspended by Disney and ABC. Kimmel was taken off-air for several days for suggesting that the murder suspect, 22-year-old Utah native Tyler Robinson, could be a supporter of President Donald Trump.</p><p>Where many Hollywood figures condemned Kimmel being pulled off the air, arguing it was censorship or a violation of free speech, Kennedy said it was fair because he made cracks at the horrific story that American viewers didn’t want to hear. </p><p>"It's like, ‘Yo, something horrific happened,'" he said. "’There’s 1 trillion things you can joke about. Maybe just not joke about this right now.’ A comedian's No. 1 thing to do is what? Read the room. The second one is to point out hypocrisies." </p><p>Kennedy continued. </p><p>"No one wanted to hear any jokes about that. I still don't. OK? It was just terrible to do, OK? Should a person be canceled for a joke? Obviously not. But here's the thing: The hypocrisy looms large."</p><p>Kennedy explained that while Kimmel got a slap on the wrist for making Kirk’s killer monologue fodder, entertainers like sitcom legend Roseanne Barr and "Star Wars" actress Gina Carano had their careers destroyed by social media posts. </p><p>"Roseanne was on the same network, a comedic icon and a female. So, you get your female, you get your comedic icon on the No. 1 show, 18 million viewers. Canceled for a tweet. She was banished — banished — to her macadamia nut farm in Hawaii, like gone. Never reconsidered."</p><p>"Gina Carano in the same company — gone, thrown out for a tweet. So, no, the hypocrisy is ridiculous," he added. </p><p>Kennedy did say he believed Kimmel’s apology for the line that got him suspended was sincere.</p><p>"I believe it was a very sincere apology, and I believe that he's truly sorry. And I've done his show many times. He's always been a very good guy to me. He's always been a nice guy."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">DAVID MARCUS: Portland's dystopia delusion coming to a city near all of us</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>It was the perfect coda to my visit to Portland, Oregon, when my phone lit up as I sat at the airport.</p><p>Lyft was letting me know that my driver, who had spent 20 minutes lecturing me about how President Trump has laundered money for Russia for decades and that Antifa doesn’t exist, had registered a complaint claiming I had discriminated against him — presumably because I disagreed with his hectoring screed.</p><p>The most amazing thing about Portland isn’t actually how far left-wing it is. Everyone has seen episodes or clips from the TV show "Portlandia." It’s how sure the people there are that everything is fine, that occasionally walking past dead bodies on the sidewalk is a normal American experience.</p><p>And how sure they seem to be that not only is anyone calling themselves a Trump supporter wrong, but immoral.</p><p>Tara Faul is a Portland-based photographer who has done excellent work documenting (and often feeding) the homeless addicts in her woebegone hometown. I was struck by something she posted on X while I was there.</p><p>"At a Portland concert last night, I heard a guy give the ‘every city is like that, bro’ to an out-of-town couple who had a rough experience in our city," she began, adding, "The wife was like, ‘No, I work in downtown Detroit, and it’s not like that.’ I was there this year and agree. It’s much cleaner."</p><p>This perfectly summed up the feeling I had, that the people in Portland are rather like a frog in boiling water. Even as the temperature rises, they cannot seem to feel the change.</p><p>Jackie, a bartender whose family has lived in the area for a century — and who is as nice as can be — told me, "You’re only talking about downtown. The rest of the city isn’t really like that."</p><p>Sure, every city has nice neighborhoods and not-so-nice ones. But the downtown area is what everyone shares. It’s the face of a city, and in the Rose City, it almost feels like Dickensian London.</p><p>Portland is very fashion-forward. There, you’ll see natty three-piece suits, handlebar mustaches and hair colors of such variety that, when in large groups, the heads appear almost like an open bag of Skittles.</p><p>Much like the elites of a Charles Dickens tale — tapping walking sticks in their finery while using a nosegay to mitigate the stench of the masses — in Portland, human misery fades into the background, like the quiet but incessant rain.</p><p>I could almost hear the hipsters mutter to themselves, "Are there no soup kitchens? Are there no safe injection sites?"</p><p>About a quarter of the storefronts, by my count, are vacant. What remains is all expensive. Outside of a class group in a museum, I’m not sure if I saw a child the entire four days I was there. There’s just no life in the place.</p><p>But, having said all that, the pickle at the end of the day is that, from what I can tell, most people in Portland think things are fine — great even. And if that’s true, then who are we in the rest of the country to tell them they’re wrong?</p><p>That’s where the warning comes in for every American city. When you hand local government over to the far left, and it refuses to maintain order, you wind up with something like "Blade Runner," where the wealthy and protected flourish, the vagrants languish and die and everyone else stays the hell away.</p><p>This is how you end up with a city where the local police arrest journalists for daring to cover the fact that Antifa has been given control of the streets. Because, in Portland, if you are anything short of a committed leftist, you can start to feel a little less than human.</p><p>The message I got from Lyft at the Portland airport instructed me to reply by saying I acknowledged the vague complaint against me. Instead, I wrote something to the effect of, "Your driver lectured me about the evils of Donald Trump and was quite rude."</p><p>When I arrived at Dulles and tried to use the Lyft app, no drivers would appear for me. I actually laughed — and then just used a different app.</p><p>But it isn’t actually funny, because this is how social credit systems work. If you say something supposedly offensive, you can’t have a bank account or get a car. And I do think many, if not most, Portlanders would deep down agree that expressing conservative views deserves punishment.</p><p>I can say with certainty that I have no desire to return to Portland, but I can also say, with great trepidation, that I’m a little worried Portland may be coming to me — and to all of us.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump on Saturday announced Israel has agreed to the "initial withdrawal line" in Gaza, which the U.S. has shared with Hamas.</p><p>Pending Hamas' confirmation, the agreement will trigger an immediate ceasefire and exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>"After negotiations, Israel has agreed to the initial withdrawal line, which we have shown to, and shared with, Hamas. When Hamas confirms, the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective, the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin, and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal, which will bring us close to the end of this 3,000 YEAR CATASTROPHE," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Saturday. </p><p>"Thank you for your attention to this matter and, STAY TUNED!"</p><p>The announcement comes hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement Saturday morning noting Israel was "on the verge of a very great achievement."</p><p>"It is not yet final; we are working on it diligently, and I hope, with God's help, that in the coming days, during the Sukkot holiday, I will be able to inform you about the return of all our hostages, both living and deceased, in one phase, while the IDF remains deep within the Strip and in the controlling areas within it," Netanyahu said.</p><p>Netanyahu claimed that after intense military and diplomatic pressure, Hamas was pressured into agreeing to Israel’s proposed plan, rejecting the fact that Hamas had previously been ready to release the Israeli hostages without a full withdrawal from Gaza.</p><p>In the first stage of the withdrawal plan, he said Hamas will release all Israeli hostages while the IDF redeploys but maintains control over key strategic areas deep inside the Gaza Strip.</p><p>Netanyahu will send his negotiating team, headed by Minister Ron Dermer, to Egypt to finalize the technical details of the hostage release, which he expects to conclude within a few days. </p><p>The prime minister emphasized that both Israel and the U.S. intend to prevent any stalling or delay tactics by Hamas. </p><p>In the second stage of the plan, Netanyahu said Hamas will be disarmed and the Gaza Strip demilitarized, either through diplomatic means under the Trump Plan or, if necessary, by military force. </p><p>"I also said this in Washington: Either it will be achieved the easy way, or it will be achieved the hard way — but it will be achieved," he said. </p><p>"Together, we pushed back our enemies' plans of destruction. From Gaza to Rafah, from Beirut to Damascus, from Yemen to Tehran, together we have achieved great things," Netanyahu added. "From victory to victory — we are changing the face of the Middle East together. Together we will continue to act to ensure the eternity of Israel."</p><p>Netanyahu thanked Trump for his assistance in dispatching the B2 planes to bomb the nuclear facility in Fordo and for his "steadfast support."</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Canada warned on Wednesday that travelers may face "entry restrictions" if they enter the United States with an "X" gender marker on their passports.</p><p>The Canadian government updated its travel advisory this week, cautioning that those carrying passports with the "X" designation could encounter problems traveling to the U.S.</p><p>"While the Government of Canada issues passports with a ‘X’ gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries," the advisory states. "You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the ‘X’ gender identifier. Before you leave, verify this information with the closest foreign representative for your destination." </p><p>The guidance appears under a section entitled "United States travel advice," updated Oct. 1.</p><p>It continued, "You should also be aware that current systems used by some countries and travel companies may not recognize the ‘X’ gender identifier. You may still be asked to provide your sex/gender information as either male or female when traveling."</p><p>Global Affairs Canada told Fox News Digital it had begun updating similar information regarding gender-neutral passports across all destinations' Travel Advice and Advisories pages. </p><p>"The Government of Canada issues Travel Advice and Advisories (TAAs) about safety and security conditions abroad to help Canadians make informed decisions and travel safely while outside of Canada," a spokesperson said.</p><p>According to the U.S. State Department website, a passport with an "X" marker is still valid until its expiration date and can be used for entry into the U.S. </p><p>The Biden administration introduced the "X" designation in 2022.</p><p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order in January requiring transgender and nonbinary applicants to list their sex as male or female according to their birth certificate when applying for passports.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A transgender volleyball player in California has helped lead a girls high school team to an undefeated start in league play and first place after multiple opponents forfeited matches.</p><p>Jurupa Valley High School's girls volleyball team improved to 6-0 in league play to cement its place at the top of the River Valley League standings with a win Friday over Rubidoux. </p><p>The win also pushed the team's overall record to 14-8 on the season. </p><p>However, eight of the team's wins, including one of its six league wins, came via forfeit. The eight teams that have forfeited games to Jurupa Valley this season have not provided a reason, but it is believed they are in response to trans athlete AB Hernandez. </p><p>The most recent team to forfeit was Patriot High School, which was the one league rival to forfeit against JVHS and also the first team within the same school district to do so. </p><p>Jurupa Valley is scheduled to face Patriot again Oct. 13. </p><p>Meanwhile, two of Hernandez's teammates have also stepped away from the team this season in protest and have filed a lawsuit against the Jurupa Unified School District (JUSD) over their experience playing with Hernandez over the last three years. </p><p>Jurupa has just five games left in the regular season, including the second Patriot meeting, before the postseason starts. </p><p>Last November, while Jurupa Valley went on to win its league, another high school in California saw a postseason match forfeited. Stone Ridge Christian High School forfeited a semifinal playoff match to San Francisco Waldorf, which had a trans player on its girls volleyball and girls basketball team. Stone Ridge Christin directly cited the trans athlete as the reason for the forfeit to San Fracisco Waldorf. </p><p>"Unfortunately, we were just informed that our opponent, San Francisco Waldorf, has a male athlete playing for their team," the team said in a statement. </p><p>"At SRC, we believe God’s Word is authoritative and infallible. It is Truth. And as Genesis makes clear, God wonderfully and immutably created each person as male or female. We do not believe sex is changeable, and we do not intend to participate in events that send a different message. We also have a duty and responsibility to care for the health and safety of our athletes. So, after consulting with our students, coaches and staff, we have made the difficult decision to forfeit Saturday’s game. Standing for Biblical truth means more than the outcome of a game." </p><p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office recently provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the state's influx of controversies involving transgender volleyball players, suggesting the situation falls outside his responsibility and deferring fault to the California Department of Education (CDE), California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) and state legislature. </p><p>"CIF is an independent nonprofit that governs high school sports. The California Department of Education is a separate constitutional office. Neither is under the Governor’s authority. CIF and the CDE have stated they follow existing state law — a law that was passed in 2013 and signed by Governor Jerry Brown (not Newsom) and in line with 21 other states. For the law to change, the legislature would need to send the Governor a bill. They have not," the statement said. </p><p>The CIF and CDE are being sued by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for refusing to change policies allowing biological males to compete in girls sports. </p><p>On April 1, the California state Legislature blocked two bills that would reverse the current law that allows males in girls sports. </p><p>Every Democrat voted against it, with Assembly member Rick Chavez Zbur arguing that one of the bills "is really reminiscent to me of what happened in Nazi Germany in the 1930s. We are moving towards autocracy in this country. In Nazi Germany, transgender people were persecuted, barred from public life." </p><p>Zbur said this while in the presence of a descendant of a Holocaust survivor, who had to excuse herself from the chamber, according to GOP Assembly member Kate Sanchez. </p><p>"She stood up and left because she was just so disgusted with the comparison," Sanchez told Fox News Digital. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., is calling for the death penalty for Alexander Dickey, a career criminal charged with the murder of college student Logan Federico, whose father supports getting justice for a "lunatic on a rampage."</p><p>Dickey allegedly shot and killed 22-year-old Logan Federico during a home invasion in Columbia, S.C., on May 3. Dickey, 30, is a convicted felon with a criminal record that includes 40 arrests, according to Mace. </p><p>"They had their chance with Alexander Dickey, and they blew it. That's why Logan's not here," her father, Stephen Federico, said Saturday on "Saturday in America."</p><p>"Logan deserves a fair trial. This is ridiculous," he told host Kayleigh McEnany. "This guy — ‘career criminal' — I don't even know if that describes it the right way. He was a lunatic on a rampage." </p><p>Mace shared on social media her letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and U.S. Attorney for South Carolina Bryan Stirling, urging the federal government to intervene in Dickey's prosecution.</p><p>"We believe the severity of these crimes, including the murder of an innocent 22-year-old girl, clearly demands the death penalty," Mace wrote. </p><p>The letter details the alleged crimes Dickey committed leading up to Logan Federico's murder.</p><p>"On the evening of May 2, 2025, Alexander Dickey fled a traffic stop by University of South Carolina police, smoked methamphetamine, wrecked his vehicle in a residential neighborhood, and then proceeded to burglarize two homes in the neighborhood," it states. </p><p>While burglarizing a third home, according to Mace's letter, Dickey entered Logan Federico’s bedroom armed with a stolen 12-gauge shotgun and shot her at point-blank range. It adds that he stole her credit cards, fled in a stolen vehicle and went on a shopping spree. </p><p>Mace called out the South Carolina attorney general's office for its "soft-on-crime" policies and Fifth Circuit Solicitor Byron Gipson, who previously said he would not yet pursue the death penalty.</p><p>Stephen Federico appeared before Congress in September to plead for stricter crime policies. </p><p>"Think about your kids," he told lawmakers on Sept. 29. "Think about your child coming home from a night out with their friends, laying down, going to sleep, feeling somebody come in the room and wake them … forced on her knees, with her hands over her head, begging for her life."</p><p>In his plea, Stephen Federico cited Dickey's 39 prior arrests and 25 felonies.</p><p>Mace pointed to Executive Order 14164, in which President Donald Trump ordered the Department of Justice to "pursue the death penalty for all crimes of a severity demanding its use."</p><p>Mace argued there is sufficient evidence for the DOJ to charge Dickey under the Hobbs Act, which carries a possible death sentence. </p><p>"We are concerned South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, who has never prosecuted a death penalty case, has politicized and acted unprofessionally in this matter, which could irrevocably jeopardize the State's ability to get justice for Logan’s family," her letter states. </p><p>Stephen Federico echoed Mace's calls for the federal government to intervene.</p><p>"The state of South Carolina — the solicitors in any of those offices — don't deserve Logan's case. They failed her already," he told McEnany. "Why do we want to let them fail her again? Period. This is a federal case that needs to be pushed that way, and I applaud Ms. Mace to do that."</p><p>Bondi has not yet publicly responded to Mace's letter. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Nicole Kidman’s six-word quip about her divorce from Tom Cruise is going viral after her split from Keith Urban.</p><p>Appearing on "The Late Show with David Letterman" on Aug. 2, 2001, Kidman was in the middle of her highly publicized divorce from Cruise when the late-night host opened the interview with a blunt question. </p><p>"I heard you're getting divorced. How's that going?" he asked at the time. </p><p>Letterman remarked that her appearance on the show was a good sign things were "all right," to which she responded with a half-smile, telling him, "I'd probably still be here" even if they weren't.When asked whether people were constantly bringing up her breakup, the Oscar-winning actress admitted, "Um, yeah, I get a lot of questions."</p><p>Kidman’s next six-word quip left the audience cheering, and fans are still buzzing years later.</p><p>With a sly smile and a pause, Kidman delivered, "Well, I can wear heels now."</p><p>The audience erupted in applause, and even Letterman laughed. "Let’s move on," Kidman said. "Now we move on."</p><p>Kidman joined Letterman at the time to promote her horror film, "The Others." </p><p>Letterman went on to make cheeky remarks during the interview, as Kidman and the late-night host continued to trade playful banter.</p><p>"Things are fine. It’s fine," Kidman said, brushing off her high-profile split with Cruise. Then, with a smirk, she threw it back to Letterman, asking, "How was your divorce?"</p><p>Clips of the 2001 interview have sparked fan reaction on social media, with one user making the comment, "Good. I've been missing her excellent taste in shoes."</p><p>Before marrying Urban in 2006, Kidman was married to Cruise for more than a decade. The two met on the set of "Days of Thunder" in 1989, married the following year and adopted two children, Isabella and Connor, before splitting in 2001.</p><p>The interview clip has resurfaced online following news that Kidman and Urban have called it quits after 19 years of marriage.</p><p>On Sept. 30, Kidman filed for divorce from Urban. She cited "irreconcilable differences" and ongoing "marital difficulties," according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital.</p><p>Kidman listed Sept. 30 as the couple’s date of separation.</p><p>In the filing, the "Big Little Lies" star asked to be named the primary residential parent of the couple’s two daughters, Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret.</p><p>The country star stepped back into the spotlight just days after the curtain dropped on his marriage to the Hollywood actress.</p><p>In his first concert after Kidman filed for divorce, the country superstar took the stage in Hershey, Pennsylvania Oct. 2 with a show full of surprises, one being the absence of Maggie Baugh, a guitarist for Urban who has been thrust into the narrative of his split from Kidman.</p><p>The guitarist has recently been in the spotlight after a video began circulating that shows Urban changing a lyric in his song "The Fighter," originally written for Kidman, to name Baugh during a September concert.</p><p>It has been noted that Urban often changes these particular lyrics. "The Fighter" was originally recorded as a duet with Carrie Underwood, and when the two performed the song at the 2017 CMT Music Awards, he sang her name instead of "baby."</p><p>At the Oct. 2 show, Us Weekly reported, Urban dropped the song altogether.</p><p>One notable moment in the country singer's performance came when Urban strummed through his 2024 track, "Heart Like a Hometown." During that performance, a slideshow of photos appeared, and despite the divorce news, a photo of Kidman and their two children was featured.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Newly released 911 transcripts reveal the fear and chaos that gripped students, staff and clergy inside a Minneapolis church when a gunman clad in tactical gear opened fire on them in August.</p><p>The transcripts, obtained by Fox News Digital, include teachers whispering to calm students and staff urging children to stay hidden at Annunciation Catholic Church, while passersby outside describe the gunfire. </p><p>The heroism of educators and staff who kept students quiet under pews and sheltered in a downstairs classroom is vividly revealed.</p><p>"Dear God, dear God in heaven, there’s some guns in Annunciation Church, on 54th," Karen McCann, a parishioner hiding in the sanctuary, told a dispatcher.</p><p>"We’re all crouched down under the — it just happened. We’re crouched under the pews. … I’s a whole bunch of people here," McCann said. "He might be coming in the church again."</p><p>The dispatcher tried to reassure her, saying, "We have so many responders on the way to you."</p><p>The Aug. 27 mass shooting left two children dead and 18 others injured. The alleged gunman, Robin Westman, killed himself with his own weapon, police said. </p><p>In the Minneapolis police offense report also obtained by Fox News Digital, investigators labeled the attack with "no bias" motivation, meaning it was not classified as a hate crime under state reporting standards.</p><p>The first 911 calls came from people outside the church who either saw the gunman or heard bullets ring out as early as 8:27 a.m., as students were getting ready to pray.</p><p>"There’s gunshots. … There’s like gunshots all over," an unidentified caller said. "Uhm, must have been 20 all together in a bunch of different bursts," the caller said.</p><p>Jillian Mai, a parent driving by, described a man "in head-to-toe camo gear" with "black goggles … standing in place next to the church," while neighbor Caitlin Nolan said she saw the shooter across the street.</p><p>"He was shooting at the church. … He seemed to be wearing all black and had a black, gigantic [gun]," Nolan said. "[It] had to be automatic."</p><p>Inside, the horror was unfolding.</p><p>"We need, we need medical assistance ASAP. We got multiple people have been shot," an unidentified woman caller, likely a staff member, told a dispatcher.</p><p>Father Dennis Zehren confirmed that children were inside the church and that the gunman was active at the south end of the building.</p><p>Becca Hare, a fourth-grade teacher, confirmed people were injured.</p><p>"I don’t know how many people are here, but there are people hurt," Hare said. "Stay down, stay down, OK … I’m going to go help. I’m going to go help."</p><p>The calls reveal dispatchers telling the terrified callers to stay hidden as teachers worked to keep students quiet under the pews.</p><p>A teacher named Diane reported that she and her aides were downstairs, where they managed to barricade doors and took in fleeing children, actions that also likely kept the children safe from stray fire.</p><p>"We were downstairs having crackers, and, all of a sudden, we heard gunshots. … There’s a whole bunch of kids started coming in ’cause they’re running from everywhere," she said.</p><p>"We’re in the church basement, locked in the classroom right now."</p><p>At the end of Hare’s call, she told students that the police had arrived, and she began giving commands to others to move out.</p><p>"People just asked if someone was hurt, and they said yes," Hare said. "If you’re injured and you can walk, could you walk?" she said as she tried to evacuate the children.</p><p>"Injured are going. We are evacuating," she said. "We are going to the school. We are going to the school. It’s OK, I promise."</p><p>Outside, two of Westman’s stray bullets also hit the car of motorist Timothy Barnes, who said he was driving by as gunfire erupted.</p><p>"I saw a guy start shooting and my car got hit by bullets," Barnes said. </p><p>Barnes described the shooter as being in all-black tactical gear with an assault rifle, standing "between the school and the church in a green space."</p><p>In other documents obtained by Fox News Digital, police confirmed that a death by suicide occurred as part of the same case.</p><p>Westman is not named in the documents, which were redacted in accordance with Minnesota state law. Minneapolis police, however, identified him by name during a press briefing following the shooting.</p><p>Two children, Fletcher Merkel and Harper Moyski, were killed, and 18 people — 15 of them children — were injured. Sophia Forchas, who was shot in the head is making a steady recovery.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Police race to save murder evidence from being turned into scrap metal</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Detective Devin Rigo knew the clock was ticking as he raced to a metal scrapyard just north of Portland, Oregon. Rigo, with the Hillsboro Police Department, had just learned about the discovery of a maroon minivan he believed contained evidence connected to the murder of 56-year-old <span class="link">Kenneth "Kenny" Fandrich</span>, a contract pipe fitter.  </p><p>On Jan. 27, 2023, Kenny Fandrich was discovered in a parking garage at the Intel campus in Hillsboro. Police reviewed surveillance camera images and determined that Fandrich had been dragged into the minivan by a masked man. Police believed the killer had broken Fandrich's neck and killed him inside the minivan, before staging his body back in the driver's seat of his own vehicle. </p><p>From evidence found at the scene, investigators believed the murder suspect tried to cover his crime by spray-painting multiple security cameras in the parking garage with blue spray paint. Correspondent Natalie Morales covers the investigation into Kenny Fandrich's murder and the hunt for the killer in "Murder in the Parking Garage," now streaming on Paramount+.</p>
<p>Soon after police arrived on the scene, Intel security personnel provided investigators with recordings from their hundreds of security cameras in the parking garage. Police soon had images of a suspect – wearing a hard hat, tinted glasses and a face mask – spray-painting the security cameras around Fandrich's car early that morning, to apparently conceal the crime. At the time, the suspect had not been detected by Intel. But when police looked at the footage, they discovered that the spray paint didn't cover everything the cameras recorded. </p>
<p>Police believed that whoever had killed Fandrich waited for him inside that minivan, then attacked Fandrich when he returned to his car after his shift. The killer left the garage in the maroon minivan soon after.</p><p>The night that Fandrich's body was found, his wife, Tanya Fandrich, told investigators Kenny had a stalker: a well-off former veterinarian named Dr. Steven Milner. Tanya Fandrich had worked for Milner at his vet clinic for years, and they had an affair, which Tanya Fandrich said was long over. Police found that Kenny Fandrich had filed several orders for protection against Milner, and that Milner had been warned by Hillsboro police officers to stop following Kenny Fandrich. Just months before Kenny Fandrich's murder, Milner had been caught placing a tracking device on one of the Fandrichs' vehicles and was criminally charged. After several days of investigation, police arrested Milner and charged him with the murder of Kenny Fandrich. </p>
<p>Once in custody, police were able to connect the minivan, and another vehicle, to Milner, who had left them at a Home Depot parking lot for long periods of time. </p>
<p>To prove the case against Milner, investigators felt they had to find that minivan. "Because it's the minivan that we believe was really our main crime scene …" said Rigo. "We thought there was going to be forensic evidence … in that minivan." </p><p>Rigo and his partner, Detective Stephanie Winter, called the vehicles "burner cars."</p><p>"Everybody kind of is more familiar with like a burner phone …" said Rigo, "where you have a phone that's not … traced to you but, you know, you can use it for what you need, get rid of it … Essentially, he did the same thing, but with a car."</p><p>The maroon minivan had been flagged at the Home Depot parking lot and the VIN number had been recorded. Security footage showed the van leaving the Home Depot parking lot shortly before Fandrich was murdered.</p>
<p>"We are sending flyers to every agency in the area," said Rigo about the minivan's VIN number. </p>
<p>The first alert they got was from the Oregon Department of Transportation. The minivan had been towed off the side of the busy I-5 highway in North Portland just days after Fandrich was murdered. Detectives believe it had been dumped there by Milner. Rigo called the tow company and found out the minivan had been sold to a scrap metal company. That's when he started racing to the scrapyard to see if they could retrieve the minivan, and the key crime scene evidence it may have held. But he was too late. When Rigo arrived and asked about the minivan, he was shown a video of the crime scene being picked up and smashed to pieces. "I was able to watch one of my key pieces of evidence be crushed and taken away," said Rigo, "before my very eyes … exactly a week too late."</p><p><em>Discover how the investigation unfolded, and Milner's defense at trial, on this week's "48 Hours," "Murder in the Parking Garage."</em></p>

<p>Detectives Stephanie Winter and Devin Rigo of the Hillsboro, Oregon, Police Department had never encountered a crime scene like the one they encountered in January 2023. </p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: How would you two characterize this case when you first got it? What did you think? </p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: You know, I just thought that it's a wild case. </p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: It was in the evening … after nine. </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: So we all got a page on our department cell phones saying that there was … death at Intel. </p>
<p>Intel, the giant tech company known for its innovative computer chips, had several large production facilities in Hillsboro, outside of Portland. </p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: It didn't make sense. … He looked like he had passed peacefully. … there was minimal blood within the car. </p><h2>POLICE FIND A DEAD BODY INSIDE AN OREGON PARKING GARAGE</h2><p>The deceased was <span class="link">Kenneth "Kenny" Fandrich</span>, age 56, a contract pipe fitter at the plant. His wife, Tanya, had reported him missing when he was late getting home. Like many couples, they shared their locations on their phones. Tanya tracked him to the Intel parking lot. </p>
<p>TANYA FANDRICH (police bodycam video): What's wrong? </p>
<p>OFFICER: We — we're not sure right now.</p><p>She was already there at the garage when police arrived with body cameras rolling.</p><p>OFFICER (police bodycam video): So, we're going to have the fire — we're gonna have the medics — </p><p>TANYA FANDRICH: Where is he? …</p><p>OFFICER: He's here in the garage somewhere … </p><p>A short time later, she learned that her husband was dead.</p><p>The Hillsboro Police Mobile Command Center was stationed at the scene, and that was where detectives first talked to Tanya. </p>
<p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong> (Inside the Mobile Command Center): That night, you — you brought Tanya Fandrich, right in here … What did she seem like to you?</p><p><strong>Det. Dayanna Mesch</strong>: She was very monotone … in the way she was speaking.</p><p>Detective Dayanna Mesch was first to interview Tanya Fandrich. </p><p><strong>Det. Dayana Mesh</strong>: She seemed very out of her body. Like she didn't react as —</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Det. Dayanna Mesch</strong>: — as much as you would think somebody would … but I had to kind of pull a lot of the answers out of her.</p><p>Mesch learned more about why Tanya had been at the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Dayanna Mesch</strong>: She told me that they had some issues in the past with their marriage … now … they would check in on each other more often. …</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Do alarm bells sort of go off here? </p><p><strong>Det. Dayanna Mesch</strong>: Yeah. There was some suspicion … we always look at the people closest to the deceased.</p><p>But Mesch knew better than to draw conclusions right away. </p><p><strong>Det. Dayanna Mesch</strong>: Everybody grieves differently … it just was different than other victims I've seen … </p><p>There was a lot to process for Tanya and investigators. The scene did not appear violent.</p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: His lunch bag … his lunch, his keys, his phone, all set neatly next to him in the passenger seat. </p>
<p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: My first thought was, how are we going to figure this out? </p><p>Their first clues would come from those surveillance cameras. </p>
<p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo </strong>(watching security video): So he will pop up right here, uh, next to that column that we're seeing right here in the — in the corner. Just kinda waits for a camera and then just pops up. </p><p>The detectives discovered a man wearing a hard hat and red-mirror tinted glasses had actually spray painted those cameras around 7 a.m. earlier that same day — his movements undetected by Intel security. </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: I wanna say about six or seven cameras.</p><p>But there were also cameras that had not been sprayed. And investigators locked in on images of a vehicle they believed belonged to the suspect.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: We're looking at early afternoon now, and then we see this maroon van come in the parking garage. And no front plate on the car. </p>
<p>It was an older, maroon-colored Dodge van. They tracked the van's movement's camera by camera before it disappeared. Under a layer of blue spray paint, moments later they could just make out the van pulling into a parking spot. </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo </strong>(watching security video): So right here, you can see that the van is this shadow right in here. </p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: OK, right. </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: And then, this vehicle right here is actually Kenneth Fandrich's black Honda Civic.</p>
<p>It was 3:21 p.m., just after Kenny had finished his shift. </p><p>He is seen on video walking back through the garage. And then… very hard to see… behind the blue spray paint.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo </strong>(watching surveillance video): You can see a little bit of movement right here — </p>
<p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Mm-hmm. </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: — in the — in the thing. And that is Kenneth walking back to his car. </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: You just kind of have to watch the — kind of shadows essentially what's going on —  </p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Mm-hmm. </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: — between the two vehicles. </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: — you start seeing the headlights flash a couple times like, you know … somebody be unlocking their car.</p><p>Detectives say the headlights on Kenny's Honda flashed as he unlocked his car with his key fob. That's when they believe the masked man grabbed Fandrich, still holding onto his keys. </p>
<p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo  </strong>(watching security video):  You see a lot of movement happening all of a sudden. </p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Then you see a lot of lights. </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: A lot of lights.</p><p>Detectives say that's Kenny desperately pushing his key fob as the masked man dragged him into that maroon van.</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: What do you think that's what's going on in there during that when you see those lights flashing? </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: We think … that's when the person in the van is murdering Kenneth. </p><p>Detectives say Kenny was killed inside that maroon Dodge van before the killer staged Kenny's body in his black Honda. </p>
<p>That meant the van itself would be a critical piece of evidence – the actual murder scene.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: There could have been … clothing … and who knows … what … else in that minivan. </p><p>But finding the van would be a challenge. They couldn't see the license plates or the driver. </p><p>The results of the autopsy would reveal – Kenny Fandrich had died from "blunt and compressive trauma of the neck."</p><p>His neck had been broken. But who would want to kill Kenny Fandrich? </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: It was really … initially like this big whodunit for us, a big mystery.</p><p>A mystery they hoped might be solved when Intel security staff told investigators about another incident — additional video images from the garage recorded a month earlier. </p>
<p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: … we learned that, hey, FYI, we — about a month prior, we reported our cameras being spray painted as well. </p><p>That incident was investigated — a criminal  mischief call — but they never figured out who it was. </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>:  … it was a man dressed in a — </p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: A construction — </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>:  — construction helmet, black glasses, a mask. And we're like, well, that's a clue. </p>
<p>Investigators were 100 percent certain it was the same person, wearing different glasses, and they say these new images revealed an unusual clue.</p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: We had this — this distinctive forehead crease that we could see in this photo. </p>
<p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: That little bit of forehead that you see. </p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: Just the little bit of forehead. That's — that's what we got. </p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: That's a very odd clue right there </p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: It is … But for us it was a big — a big deal. </p><p>And the detectives had one other "big deal" — something Tanya Fandrich told them the night her husband died. </p><p>OFFICER (police bodycam video) Has he — has he been having any issues lately? </p><p>TANYA FANDRICH: No, but he has a stalker. </p>
<p>A stalker — who had been harassing her husband. And she had proof: a video from their ownhome security camera.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: You actually see the person … kinda crawl and move around a bit underneath the — the trailer right there.</p><h2>WHO WAS STALKING KENNY FANDRICH?  </h2><p>In the early hours of the investigation into the murder of Kenny Fandrich, his wife Tanya told detectives her husband had a stalker — seen on the couple's home security cameras in the carport of their home in Oregon City, Oregon. </p>
<p><strong>Devin Rigo</strong>: Here's …some sort of like utility trailer right here. … And you'll notice right under the trailer — you actually see the person … kinda crawl and move around a bit underneath … the trailer right there. </p><p>Tanya told detectives the stalker was her old boss, Dr. Steven Milner. Milner was a well-to-do veterinarian, worth millions. She had worked with him in his clinic as a vet tech. </p><p>Friends Cheryl Choquette and Darlyn Robinson were longtime clients of the vet. </p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: What was he like — </p>
<p><strong>Darlyn Robinson</strong>: He was —</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: — as a vet? </p><p><strong>Darlyn Robinson</strong>: — he was wonderful. He was very compassionate, caring, kind.</p><p><strong>Cheryl Choquette</strong>: He was a great vet. </p><p>Choquette even took part in a video Milner made for his clinic, which had aired on the local news.</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: The kind of vet that get — gets down at the level of the dog? Like on the floor with them? </p><p><strong>Cheryl Choquette</strong>: Definitely on the floor.</p>
<p>And both Choquette and Robinson knew Tanya — at least by sight.</p><p><strong>Darlyn Robinson</strong>: She was there for, I think 19 years and … she was the one who would come out and get us to take us back to the room and kind of do the intake on the animals.</p><p><strong>Cheryl Choquette</strong>: Just a sweet, nice lady, very, you know, kind of quiet … but super friendly and very caring.</p>
<p>Detectives soon learned about a complicated relationship between Tanya and Milner. Tanya told investigators she and Milner had once had an affair — it began in early 2017. At the time, Milner was separated, and Tanya said her relationship with Kenny hit a rough patch. </p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Did you notice any interactions between her and Dr. Milner?</p><p><strong>Cheryl Choquette</strong>: Just completely professional. … It was just, you know, he comes in, she goes out of the room.</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: He was the boss?</p>
<p><strong>Cheryl Choquette</strong>: Mm-hmm. Yeah. </p><p>But Robinson thought she noticed something.</p><p><strong>Darlyn Robinson</strong>: There came a point where my brain just kind of went, I wonder if there's, you know, something going on, cause …. just looks they would give each other. </p><p>Milner and Tanya tried to keep their affair quiet, say investigators. Milner even gave her a secret name: Kiki.</p><p><strong>Mahalee Streblow</strong>: One of the nicknames … was Kiki Essex.</p><p>Prosecutor Mahalee Streblow worked on the case.</p><p><strong>Mahalee Streblow</strong>: It's one of those, that's like … you know, the name of your first pet and then the street that … you grew up on. </p>
<p>But the couple's affair was exposed after a few months in July 2017, when they attended a wedding together. Prosecutor John Gerhard.</p><p><strong>John Gerhard</strong>: There were employees from the veterinary clinic that were there. </p><p><strong>Mahalee Streblow</strong>: She was under the impression that Kenneth was out of town for work.</p><p><strong>John Gerhard</strong>: Tanya indicated that they had both been drinking and that they were engaging in more physical intimacy in front of the employees during that wedding.</p><p>As the night ended, Tanya went home with Milner.</p><p><strong>Mahalee Streblow</strong>: Lo and behold, Kenneth was not out of town for work. </p><p>When Tanya didn't return home that night, Kenny went to Milner's house.</p>
<p><strong>Mahalee Streblow</strong>: And that's how they got caught.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: Kenny didn't confront or make a big scene at the house. He kind of left the house and then started calling, um … to try to figure out what's going on. </p><p>According to Tanya, she ended the affair soon after they were caught.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: After that … the relationship with Tanya and Steve Milner kind of stopped — </p><p>And that's when Kenny Fandrich said Dr. Milner started harassing him. </p><p><strong>Michael Fuller</strong>: When Kenny came to me, he was terrified. </p><p>Michael Fuller was Kenny's attorney<strong>.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Michael Fuller</strong>: This stalking issue had basically consumed his life. </p><p>Fuller says Milner started with harassing calls, then escalated from there.</p><p><strong>Michael Fuller</strong>: Milner literally coming onto his property in the middle of the night … following him, to work, threatening him, those type of things. </p><p>Tanya eventually left Milner's clinic. But Milner continued to track Kenny. Detectives found plenty of evidence of exactly how he did it. </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo </strong>(looking at evidence with Morales): Tanya actually provided this to us. … and this is one of the actual tracking devices that Steven Milner had placed on one of their vehicles. </p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>:  — is this the device there?</p><p><strong>Stephanie Winter</strong>: So this — so this is the device.</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Uh-huh.</p><p><strong>Stephanie Winter</strong>: We believe this to be the battery pack. And what they had done and put it in this case with the magnets –</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Stephanie Winter</strong>: — and then put it up underneath their vehicle.</p><p>In August 2019, roughly two years after Tanya said she ended the affair, Kenny applied for an order of protection against Milner. But detectives would learn the harassment continued – and the vet's infatuation with Tanya deepened. </p><p><strong>Stephanie Winter</strong>: He wanted Tanya, and he wasn't going to stop.</p><h2>THE VETERINARIAN'S OBSESSION</h2><p>Within days of Kenny Fandrich's death, investigators set their sights on a suspect: veterinarian Dr. Steven Milner. Detectives learned he was obsessed with Tanya.</p>
<p>There were love notes.</p><p><strong>John Gerhard </strong>(reading letter aloud):One of them was: "the one absolute rock, solid truth is that I love you. I have never loved anyone that way. … I am consumed by your soul."</p><p>He wrote letters like that for years even after Tanya had said the affair was over.</p><p>Detectives also learned more about Tanya's relationship with her husband Kenny.</p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: It was a tumultuous relationship. … Alcohol came into play between them. … they were often, you know, as you can say, hot and cold … They argued a lot.</p><p>Kenny had been charged with domestic violence years before but the charges were not pursued, and the couple reconciled. Then, in August 2021 — years after Tanya says she ended the affair with Milner — the couple had another fight; this time she was arrested.</p><p>The next day, something surprising happened.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: Somebody posted her bail. She had $25,000 bail … when she leaves the jail, Steven Milner is in the parking lot waiting for her.</p><p>Tanya told investigators she ended up staying with the doctor for a couple of days before returning to Kenny. She insisted nothing romantic happened. Milner was just helping her out as a friend.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: To this day … none of us can figure out how Steven Milner actually found out she had been arrested that night.</p><p>That case was later dismissed and the couple reunited again. But Milner's campaign of harassment continued.</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: What do you think his end goal was … what did he think he could do -- end their marriage and then end up happily ever after —  </p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: Exactly.</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>:  — with Tanya?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: Yeah.</p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: Exactly. … He wanted Kenneth out of the picture. So, he could be that white knight to save Tanya.</p><p>In March 2022, just ten months before Kenny's murder, Milner followed Kenny from Oregon City all the way to Hillsboro — a 45-minute drive. </p><p>Kenny spotted him and called police. Milner was pulled over as body cameras captured the interaction.</p><p>OFFICER EDWARDS (police bodycam video): Hi, Officer Edwards, Hillsboro police. … Do you know why we're stopping you today?</p><p>DR. STEVE MILNER: Yeah. I'm trying to get a hold of this guy that — I'm following him.</p>
<p>The responding officer learned from dispatch that there was history between the two men.</p>
<p>OFFICER (police bodycam video): What's your role in the whole thing?</p><p>DR. STEVE MILNER: Uh, she has been a friend of mine for 20 years. </p><p>Milner told police he believed Tanya was in danger because she had allegedly told him Kenny was abusive. </p><p>DR. STEVE MILNER (police bodycam video):  I'm the only person who gives a sh** and I'm not allowed to give a sh** …</p><p>OFFICER: So here's my advice to you, OK? And this is very, very strong advice. Leave them alone. He wants nothing to do with you. She wants nothing to do with you. … If you show up at their house, if you contact them, anything like that, you're gonna go to jail.</p><p>After that traffic stop, Kenny filed for a new order for protection. The original one had expired years earlier.</p><p>Michael Fuller: Kenny was absolutely in — in fear of his life.</p>
<p>And two weeks later, he was so stressed out, he told police he crashed his car.</p>
<p>KENNETH FANDRICH (police bodycam video): … my wife and I have been fighting today —</p><p>OFFICER: Sorry.</p><p>KENNETH FANDRICH:  — and um, I thought she was at her boss's house, where I've caught her cheating on me.</p><p>OFFICE: I'm sorry.</p><p>KENNETH FANDRICH: And I was driving over there, and he's just like right down at road and, I lost control on my car. I just –</p><p>Kenny's attorney says his client had every reason to be stressed out.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Fuller</strong>: Kenny told me that Milner … said, "Hey, I'm a veterinarian. I've done surgeries and I have the tools to chop you up into little pieces." </p><p>In August 2022, after Kenny found another tracking device under his car, Milner was criminally charged and was awaiting trial.</p><p><strong>Michael Fuller</strong>: It was pretty clear to me that Milner was not in his right mind. </p><p>Just a month later, Kenny filed a civil suit seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars for invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress — allegedly brought on by Milner's stalking, harassment, and trespass.</p><p>Five months later Kenny Fandrich was dead.</p><p>Just days after the murder, detectives were convinced that Steven Milner was that man behind the mask, but they needed more evidence.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: We need to get eyes on Steven Milner because we know there was some sort of violent confrontation. We want to see if he had any injuries.</p>
<p>Not wanting to tip him off – investigators asked him to come in for a check in about the stalking case.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: So, we arranged a meeting for Steven to come in to sign some paperwork. … Detective Winter was inside at a reception desk.</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: And your goal sitting there at the receptionist desk — sort of as an undercover, right?</p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: I wanted to see if he had any injury to himself. … He walks in. He looks extremely nervous.</p><p>Another person in the office noticed something. </p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: She says, "Hey, he has got makeup on his face." </p><p>Makeup, investigators say, Milner used to cover up a scratch on his nose.</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Bingo. You're thinking we got our guy?</p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: I — I — yep. At that point, I thought, this is him. This is our guy that — that did this.</p><p>Moments later, after Milner walked out the door —</p><p>DEPUTY DAVIS (police bodycam video):  Hi sir, I'm Deputy Davis, the Sheriff's Office. We're being recorded by my camera. So, everything is going to be audio and visually recorded. … Do you understand that?</p><p>DR. STEVE MILNER: Yes.</p><p>DEPUTY DAVIS: OK, sounds good. … Right now, you're being detained.</p>
<p>On Jan. 31, 2023, four days after Kenny Fandrich was found dead, Steven Milner was taken into custody. Within days, Milner was charged with second-degree murder and stalking. </p>
<p>With Milner in custody, Rigo and Winter were quickly able to connect one important clue from those surveillance camera images: that unusual crease in the masked man's forehead.</p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: There's that very prominent forehead crease that I don't — he couldn't hide if he tried.</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: There is no amount of makeup hiding that crease.</p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: No. </p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Do you feel at this point like you've got like a pretty solid case?</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: We had a lot of circumstantial pieces, like putting the puzzle together, but we are just at the tip of the iceberg of what we still need to find out.</p><p>More puzzle pieces would be found in Milner's house.</p>
<h2>CONNECTING THE PUZZLE PIECES</h2><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: It was shocking that somebody this successful … a doctor … now suspect in a murder. </p><p>With Dr. Steven Milner now in police custody, Hillsboro Detectives Stephanie Winter and Devin Rigo set out to find evidencethat couldprove Milner was at the scene when Kenny Fandrich was murdered.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: So, as soon as he is arrested … We're getting search warrants for his DNA to be taken … we're getting search warrants for his house as well.</p><p>And detectives weren't quite prepared for what they found at his home.</p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: We found a cardboard cutout behind a mirror of Steven Milner's face placed on a very oiled, masculine man with a dog paw tattoo over his heart.</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Very odd memorabilia — to have in your bedroom.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: I would say so. </p><p>And there was more.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: In the nightstand, in Steven's master bedroom, is a bunch of items that we kind of refer to as a shrine to Tanya. There was a framed picture of Tanya. There were love notes … there were women's underwear … just like very like personal keepsakes from, what — their relationship together.</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: That's more than just collecting a few love notes and cards. …</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: Especially from … someone who hadn't been in a relationship with you for several years at this time period.</p>
<p>To build their case, investigators needed to connect the maroon-colored minivan -- seen in the Intel parking garage parked next to Kenny's car -- to Milner. But as far as investigators could determine, Milner usually drove the white Toyota SUV he'd been in when he was arrested. </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: initially, we didn't know what evidence this car could provide us.</p>
<p>So, they ordered an FBI forensic analysis of the SUV's computer, hoping it might provide some clues about Milner's movements before and after Kenny's murder.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo </strong>(showing Milner's SUV to Morales): So essentially … the computer that's in the car retains a lot of information. </p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: And luckily one of those things is like GPS data points …</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Where was that bit of information? … is that a computer that's pulled out on top there?</p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: Yeah. So that's part of the front dash … And then, it was just … a little … motherboard type thing that had a chip in it.</p><p>Within weeks, they got a call from their digital expert.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: She … said, you guys need to look at the Home Depot in Oregon City …  He's there a lot the day of the murder. </p><p>A Home Depot just 15 minutes down the road from Milner's house.</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales </strong>(in the Home Depot parking lot with detectives): How central did this place become towards a piecing together the evidence that you had?</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: Like this was essentially like center stage of the investigation.</p><p>The detectives asked Home Depot security personnel if there had been suspicious activity in the lot recently. Amazingly, they said yes: two cars — a maroon minivan and a blue sedan — had been flagged for parking there for long periods of time with only temporary, paper license plates. </p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: And we learned that there had been a lot of calls created in the past couple months with a suspicious … blue car and … maroon minivan. </p><p>For the second time in a matter of weeks, parking lot security cameras and the images they recorded, would provide investigators with key clues. In a clip  from Jan. 27, 2023 – the day of Kenny's murder – detectives say you can see Milner's white SUV pull up and park. Within minutes, the driver – believed to be Steven Milner – gets into the maroon minivan. Another camera then captured the minivan exiting the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: So, what was he doing with the cars?</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: So essentially this was like his staging location. So, he would drive his personal car here and then either pick up the blue sedan or the maroon minivan and then drive that out to Hillsboro. …</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: What do you call them?</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: Burner cars.</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Burner cars.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: Yeah. … everybody kind of is more familiar with like a burner phone … where you have a phone that's not … traced to you but, you know, you can use it for what you need, get rid of it. … Essentially, he did the same thing, but with a car.</p><p>Investigators believed Milner may have been using those burner cars to secretly follow Kenny to work — even after law enforcement had told him to stop.</p>
<p>They also learned Home Depot security cameras had images of the driver of those cars shopping in the store about a month before Kenny was murdered.</p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: he parked right in front of Home Depot …</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: He went in and … we saw him come to the self-checkout area … and he had bought a pair of like safety glasses. …</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Was … his face visible in that surveillance?</p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: It was.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: Oh yeah …</p>
<p> There was no doubt — it was Steven Milner. And those glasses he bought? Detectives say you can see them in his right hand as he exited the store. The receipt said they had a "red mirror" tint. Winter had an idea.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: We just happened to be sitting near one of the aisles and I was like, I'm going to go see where they sell … the glasses … And then a couple boxes down was … a yellow hard hat that looked very similar to the one … that he was wearing in all of the Intel garage surveillance.</p><p>The detectives were convinced this was where Milner had gotten his disguise to kill Kenny.</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: You have all of this, but you were missing one big piece of evidence. What was it?</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: We were, at this point, still missing … the maroon minivan. …</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Why is the minivan so important?</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: Because it's the minivan that we believe was really our main crime scene. … we thought there was going to be forensic evidence … in that minivan. So, we really wanted to get that minivan to help really put the icing on …  this case. </p><p>Rigo was laser focused on tracking down that maroon minivan and he got an incredibly lucky break. When those suspicious burner cars had been flagged, the VIN number was also recorded. Rigo searched it and found out that van had been found abandoned just a few days after the murder.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: The highway people, had … towed it off the side of the I-5 in north Portland.</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: It had been dumped then.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: It had been dumped there. … So, I called the tow company, "Hey, do you have this car?" "No, sorry … We sold it to a scrap metal company."</p><p>Rigo knew the clock was ticking to retrieve what he believed was the crime scene and all of the key evidence it held.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: So, me and another detective drive as quick as we can to north Portland.</p>
<p>But they were too late. When he asked about the minivan, the scrapyard showed Rigo a video of the maroon minivan police believe Milner drove to the Intel garage to kill Kenny just moments before it was pulverized by the metal jaws of the scrapyard claw.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: I was able to watch one of my key pieces of evidence be crushed and taken away.</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Before your very eyes.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: Before my very eyes — </p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Oh my gosh.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: — exactly a week too late.</p><h2>DOCTOR MILNER ON TRIAL</h2><p>On Jan. 13, 2025, Steven Milner went on trial — charged with stalking and murdering Kenny Fandrich. Washington County prosecutors John Gerhard and Mahalee Streblow knew they faced a challenge without that maroon minivan, where they believe Steven Milner murdered Kenny. </p><p><strong>John Gerhard</strong>: All the evidence that was inside the van was lost with it. … the biggest disappointment for us is there was likely a lot of forensic evidence …</p><p>But prosecutors had some forensic evidence they say put Steven Milner at the scene: DNA from swabs taken of Kenny Fandrich's hands.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: I remember getting an email of the results and immediately opening it and being like, "Oh my gosh, this is it." … Steven Milner's DNA was on Kenneth Fandrich's hands. …</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Now you really felt like you had your case made.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: Yes, because there is no way he could explain away why his DNA would've been on Kenneth's body. </p><p>Steven Milner would have an explanation for that. To everyone's surprise, Milner took the stand, admitting he did spray paint the cameras and was in the Intel garage waiting for Kenny. He presented what detectives believed was a far-fetched explanation: he was trying to save Tanya. There were no cameras in court, but there is audio of Milner telling Prosecutor John Gerhard why he was in the Intel lot that day.</p><p>STEVEN MILNER (in court): I was trying to get him arrested for driving while he was drunk, or driving without a license.</p><p>JOHN GERHARD: Why was it your responsibility to enforce Oregon traffic laws?</p><p>STEVEN MILNER: I was trying to keep Tanya from getting killed. </p>
<p><strong>John Gerhard</strong>: He had this delusional belief that he needed to protect Tanya Fandrich. </p><p><strong>Mahalee Streblow</strong>: The defense case, it seemed to be … to kind of get the jury to maybe feel sympathetic to Milner. </p><p>And Milner insisted it was Kenny who attacked him after Kenny spotted Milner inside the maroon minivan.</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo:</strong> Steven essentially said, well, I knew I was caught. So, I opened the door to kinda confront him. And then Kenneth attacked me.</p><p>STEVEN MILNER (in court): We basically fought for a little bit. … there was pushing and shoving … eventually I was able to kind of push him up against the car and — and then shove him into the car. </p><p>Gerhard challenged Milner's self-defense story.</p><p>JOHN GERHARD (in court): Is that push that causes him to fall into his seat?</p>
<p>STEVEN MILNER: He hit up against the car and then kind of tripped at the same time. And I kept pushing. </p><p><strong>Mahalee Streblow</strong>: His testimony … just didn't line up with the physical evidence at the scene …</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: To my knowledge — bumping your head on the car door is not going to break your neck. </p><p>After six hours of deliberations, the jury found Steven Milner guilty of murdering Kenny Fandrich, and multiple stalking charges. </p>
<p>Cameras were allowed for Steven Milner's sentencing hearing, which took place on Feb. 18, 2025. Tanya, who asked not to be shown on camera, gave a powerful statement directed at Steven Milner. Prosecutor Mahalee Streblow read us her words: </p><p><strong>Mahalee Streblow</strong> (reading aloud): "All you had to do was stop … hear me clearly, when I say you are a vengeful, deceptive, manipulating, self-serving, aggressive, hateful, lying predator… and all you had to do was stop."</p><p>Milner was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 25 years. Milner did not respond to "48 Hours"' request for an interview. </p>
<p><strong>Mahalee Streblow</strong>: This case highlights the very worst-case scenario … take stalking seriously.</p><p>Kenny's attorney, Michael Fuller, says what happened highlights the limits of the system that is supposed to protect victims of stalking.</p><p><strong>Michael Fuller</strong>: Kenny … called the police. When that didn't work, he got a lawyer … Kenny did everything he could under the legal system, and it didn't help him at all. </p><p>After Kenny's death, Fuller filed a wrongful death suit on behalf of Kenny's estate asking for damages of several million dollars. Fuller believes Milner made millions from real estate investments and the sale of his business. </p><p><strong>Michael Fuller</strong>: In the wrongful death case, my goals are to extract as much money as we can out of Milner … If the estate recovered any money for Kenny, it would go to his wife.</p><p>For Milner's former veterinary clients, it was hard to reconcile the doctor they knew, with a now-convicted murderer.</p><p><strong>Cheryl Choquette:</strong> I could not believe that it was the same guy. …</p>
<p><strong>Darlyn Robinson</strong>: I just believe that he ended up going through some type of psychosis … And I think that … at some point he snapped …</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: I think it really gets down to, like, you never know what anybody is capable of. … you never know what monster might be inside …</p><p><strong>Natalie Morales</strong>: Almost a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde situation?</p><p><strong>Det. Devin Rigo</strong>: Yeah, absolutely.</p><p><strong>Det. Stephanie Winter</strong>: Yeah. </p><p><strong>Darlyn Robinson</strong>: He had everything to live for. You know, he … could do anything he wanted to do. … And this is where it ended up. … It's real sad. </p><p><strong> </strong></p>

<div class="article-title">Germany's Munich Airport reopens after 2nd drone-related closure in 24 hours</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Germany's Munich Airport reopened Saturday morning after authorities shut it down the night before for the second time in less than 24 hours after two additional <span class="link">drone sightings</span>, officials said. An airport in Lithuania also later closed for several hours overnight Saturday due to a possible sighting of balloons. </p><p>The closures are the latest after mysterious drone overflights in the airspace of European Union member countries.</p><p>The airport, one of Germany's largest, reopened gradually beginning at 7 a.m. local time on Saturday. Planes typically begin taking off at 5 a.m.</p><p>Federal police said two drone sightings were confirmed shortly before 11 p.m. Friday near the airport's north and south runways, the agency said in a statement Saturday. The drones flew away before they could be identified.</p><p>Delays were expected to continue throughout Saturday, the airport said in a statement. At least 6,500 passengers were impacted by the overnight closure from Friday into Saturday.</p>
<p>The previous closure, Thursday night into Friday, affected almost 3,000 passengers.</p><p>Authorities were not immediately able to provide any information about who was responsible for the overflights.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lithuania's main airport also briefly closed for several hours overnight Saturday into Sunday due to a "possible series of balloons," Agence France-Presse reported.  </p><p>Vilnius International Airport said in a Facebook post that it had received official information at 10:16 p.m. local time on Saturday that air traffic was being temporarily suspended. It was unclear where the balloons originated from and whether they were located or identified. </p>
<p>The airport later announced that its airspace had reopened at 4:50 a.m. local time Sunday. </p><p>The incidents were the latest in a <span class="link">series of incidents of mysterious drone sightings</span> over airports as well as other critical infrastructure sites in several European Union member countries. <span class="link">Drones were also spotted overnight in Belgium </span>above a military base.</p><p>Last weekend, the Danish defense ministry said that "drones have been observed at several of Danish defense facilities" overnight Friday into Saturday. The <span class="link">renewed drone sightings</span> come after there were several drone sightings in the Nordic country earlier this week, with some of them temporarily shutting down Danish airports.</p><p>A drone incident in Oslo, the capital of Norway, which is a NATO member but not part of the EU, also affected flights there late last month.</p><p>It wasn't immediately clear who has been behind the flyovers. European authorities have expressed concerns that they're being carried out by Russia, though some experts have noted that anybody with drones could be behind them. Russian authorities have rejected claims of involvement, including in recent drone incidents in Denmark.</p><p>Alexander Dobrindt, Germany's interior minister, said he and some European counterparts would discuss the drone incursions and a "drone detection and defense plan" at a meeting this weekend in Munich.</p><p>"We are in a race between drone threat and drone defense. We want to and must win this race," he said in the western city of Saarbrücken, where he joined German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron at a ceremony to mark the 35th anniversary of Germany's reunification.</p>

<div class="article-title">Oregon judge temporarily blocks deployment of the National Guard to Portland</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A federal judge in Oregon has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from sending the National Guard to Portland after the <span class="link">president said he would send troops to the city to handle "domestic terrorists.</span>" </p><p>U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued the temporary restraining order, which is set to expire on Oct. 18, according to court records.</p><p>The plaintiffs say a deployment would violate the U.S. Constitution as well as a federal law that generally prohibits the military from being used to enforce domestic laws.</p><p>Immergut wrote that the case involves the intersection of three fundamental democratic principles: "the relationship between the federal government and the states, between the military and domestic law enforcement, and the balance of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government.</p><p>"Whether we choose to follow what the Constitution mandates with respect to these three relationships goes to the heart of what it means to live under the rule of law in the United States," she wrote.</p>
<p>Generally speaking the president is allowed "a great level of deference" to federalize National Guard troops in situations where regular law enforcement forces are not able to execute the laws of the United States, the judge said. </p><p>However, she concluded that in the situation in Portland, the president "did not have a 'colorable basis' to invoke § 12406(3) to federalize the National Guard because the situation on the ground belied an inability of federal law enforcement officers to execute federal law."</p><p>Plaintiffs were able to show that the demonstrations at the Portland immigration facility were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days or weeks leading up to the president's order, the judge wrote, and "overall, the protests were small and uneventful."</p><p>The judge added that, "The President's determination was simply untethered to the facts."</p>
<p>The Defense Department had said it was placing 200 members of Oregon's National Guard under federal control for 60 days to protect federal property and personnel at locations where protests are occurring or likely to occur after Trump called the city "war-ravaged."</p><p>The state of Oregon filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration last Sunday following the president's announcement that he would send troops to Portland. The lawsuit argued that Mr. Trump lacks the authority to federalize the National Guard. </p><p>Following the ruling, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson indicated an appeal was likely, saying in a statement that "President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement — we expect to be vindicated by a higher court."  </p><p>Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield called the ruling "a healthy check on the president."</p><p>"It reaffirms what we already knew: Portland is not the president's war-torn fantasy. Our city is not ravaged, and there is no rebellion," Rayfield said in a statement. He added: "Members of the Oregon National Guard are not a tool for him to use in his political theater."</p><p>"Today's outcome is proof that Portlanders' commitment to peaceful expression and civic unity truly matters," Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said in a statement Saturday following the ruling. "We have not met aggression with aggression. We've stood firm, calm and grounded in our shared values and that is why this decision went our way. Portland has shown that peace is power."    </p><p>Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek has pushed back on Mr. Trump's plans to send troops to Portland and told reporters at a news conference last week that the city "is a far cry from the war-ravaged community he has posted on social media."  </p>
<p>Earlier in September, Mr. Trump had described living in Portland as "like living in hell."   </p><p>The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Portland has been the site of nightly protests, and the demonstrations and occasional clashes with law enforcement. A handful of immigration and legal advocates often gather at the building during the day. At night, recent protests have typically drawn a couple dozen people.</p><p>The order Saturday comes after a broader effort from the administration in what Mr. Trump has characterized as a crackdown on crime in Democratic-led cities. </p><p>Mr. Trump deployed the National Guard and active-duty Marines to <span class="link">Los Angeles </span>over the summer and as part of his law enforcement takeover in the District of Columbia. </p><p>On Saturday, <span class="link">Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said</span> that the Trump administration intends to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard members after he was offered an ultimatum to deploy the troops himself but refused.</p><p>Last month, Mr. Trump <span class="link">signed a presidential memorandum</span> mobilizing federal law enforcement agents to Memphis, Tennessee, at the request of the Tennessee governor.</p>

<div class="article-title">Netanyahu hopes to announce release of Gaza hostages "in the coming days"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hopes to announce the release of all hostages from Gaza "in the coming days," after Hamas said it has agreed to parts of the peace plan that President Trump <span class="link">outlined earlier this week</span>. </p><p>In a brief statement late Saturday, Netanyahu said he has sent a delegation to Egypt "to finalize technical details," adding that "our goal is to contain these negotiations to a time frame of a few days."</p><p>But Netanyahu signaled there would not be a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, something Hamas has long demanded.</p><p>On Friday, Hamas said in a statement that while they agreed to parts of the peace deal, including the demand to release all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, the group suggested other portions of the deal should be subject to negotiation. </p><p>A U.S. official told CBS News the United States views Hamas' response as positive, though there are details that still need to be hammered out, such as the decommissioning of weapons, which may begin as soon as next week.</p>
<p>After Hamas released its statement, Mr. Trump said Friday on Truth Social that he believes the group is "ready for a lasting PEACE." He pushed Israel to cease hostilities in the Gaza Strip. </p><p>"Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now, it's far too dangerous to do that. We are already in discussions on details to be worked out," the president wrote.</p><p>"In light of Hamas's response, Israel is preparing to immediately implement the first phase of Trump's plan for the immediate release of all hostages," a statement released by Netanyahu's office early Saturday morning local time read. "We will continue to work in full cooperation with the President and his team to end the war in accordance with the principles set forth by Israel that are consistent with President Trump's vision."</p>
<p>In a separate statement, the Israel Defense Forces said that its high-level military officials held a meeting overnight, in which Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, the IDF chief of staff, "instructed to advance readiness for the implementation of the first phase of the Trump plan for the release of the hostages."</p>
<p>An Israeli political source told CBS News that the cessation of the IDF's activity in the Gaza Strip is intended to allow Hamas to begin organizing for the release of the hostages. The source added that this is not an official ceasefire that would require Hamas to return the hostages within 72 hours, as outlined in the plan.</p><p>"This is not the beginning of a withdrawal, although there may be tactical improvements for the purpose of protecting our soldiers," the source added. "We are constantly examining what is happening on the ground and will not allow the terrorist organizations to try to take advantage of the opportunity and carry out a last-minute attack, or to strengthen their grip on the ground."</p><p>The source said the negotiations are expected to begin on Sunday.</p><p>Meanwhile, another source familiar with Israel's negotiation team told CBS News that it was getting ready to travel.</p><p>U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is set to travel to Egypt for the talks, a senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, is also expected to attend. CBS News has reached out to the White House for more details.</p><p>In a video posted to Truth Social later Friday, Mr. Trump called the deal "unprecedented in many ways" and thanked several Arab and majority Muslim countries that assisted with the deal as mediators, including Qatar and Egypt.</p><p>"This is a big day," Mr. Trump said in the video. "We'll see how it all turns out. We have to get the final word down and concrete."</p>
<p>In a follow-up post to Truth Social Saturday afternoon, Mr. Trump wrote: "After negotiations, Israel has agreed to the initial withdrawal line, which we have shown to, and shared with, Hamas. When Hamas confirms, the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective, the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin, and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal, which will bring us close to the end of this 3,000 YEAR CATASTROPHE. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, STAY TUNED!"</p><p>The post included a map of what the proposed withdrawal line could look like. </p><p>Also Saturday, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the second most powerful militant group in Gaza, said it accepted Hamas' response to the Trump plan. The group had previously rejected the proposal days earlier.</p><h2>Hamas says it's willing to release hostages, hand over control of Gaza</h2><p>Hamas said it is willing to release all living hostages and the remains of deceased hostages "in accordance with the exchange formula set forth in President Trump's proposal." The proposal laid out by the White House called for Hamas to release all hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, within 72 hours, and for Israel to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the conflict.</p><p>The deal also called for an immediate end to fighting if both sides accept the deal, and for Israel's military to withdraw to an "agreed upon line." </p><p>Hamas also said it is willing to "hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats), based on Palestinian national consensus and with the support of Arab and Islamic parties" — another portion of Mr. Trump's proposal.</p><p>A senior Egyptian official told the AP that talks are underway for the release of hostages, as well as hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention. The official, who is involved in the ceasefire negotiations, also said Arab mediators are preparing for a comprehensive dialogue among Palestinians. The talks are aimed at unifying the Palestinian position toward Gaza's future.</p>
<p>The group was less clear on other portions of the deal. The statement said some aspects of Mr. Trump's proposal "remain linked to a comprehensive national stance, grounded in relevant international laws and resolutions." It said those issues will need to be discussed "within an inclusive Palestinian national framework" that includes Hamas.</p><p>It's not clear if Hamas has agreed that it will play no role in the governance of Gaza, which was one provision of Mr. Trump's proposal.</p><p><span class="link">The plan</span>, unveiled Sept. 29 by Mr. Trump and backed by Netanyahu, called for Hamas to free all remaining Israeli hostages and for the Israeli military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases, starting with an initial withdrawal before the hostages are freed. It also proposed handing over parts of Gaza to a "technocratic" Palestinian committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.</p><p>Netanyahu, who <span class="link">joined Mr. Trump</span> for a joint news conference at the White House when the 20-point proposal was announced, had said he supports the plan, and that if Hamas does not accept the offer, "Israel will finish the job by itself." </p><p>"We're giving everybody a chance to have this done peacefully," Netanyahu had said, warning Hamas what would happen if they didn't agree to the proposal. "But if Hamas rejects your plan, Mr. President, or if they supposedly accept it and then basically do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself. This can be done the easy way or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done." </p><p>The president told Netanyahu on Monday that if Hamas were to reject the proposal, "you'd have our full backing to do what you would have to do.<strong>"</strong></p><p>Mr. Trump had said his goal is to ensure a "sustainable, long-term peace." The president on Monday also said he and Netanyahu were "waiting for signatures and waiting for approvals from a lot of different countries that are involved in this."  </p>
<p>Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.</p><p>Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.</p><p><em>Claire Day, Margaret Brennan, Lucia Suarez Sang and Melissa Gaffney contributed to this report.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Feds shoot woman in Chicago suburb after allegedly being rammed, boxed in by cars</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Department of Homeland Security now said agents shot a woman in the Brighton Park neighborhood Saturday morning after they became boxed in by vehicles. DHS originally said the shooting happened while agents were patrolling in Broadview.</p><p>According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, the incident unfolded when agents were patrolling in west suburban Broadview, where they have an ICE facility that has been the <span class="link">site of ongoing protests</span> and clashes between agents and demonstrators. </p><p>The patrolling agents were rammed by vehicles and "boxed in by 10 cars," DHS said. The statement did not say where in Broadview this occurred, but that it was "in the same area" as the ICE facility. </p><p>DHS said the agents were unable to move their vehicles and got out of the car. According to DHS officials, one of the drivers of a car boxing them in had a gun, which the agency said was a semi-automatic weapon. DHS said the agents opened fire, striking the driver, who they said is a woman. She was taken to a hospital for treatment. A spokesperson for Sinai Health System said the woman has since been released.</p><p>In their statement, DHS claimed the woman was named in a U.S. Customs and Border Protection intelligence bulletin last week for doxxing agents and posting threats against ICE online. They have not released her name or any other further information that could corroborate those claims.</p>
<p>DHS said no agents were injured.</p><h2>Protest erupts at the scene of the shooting</h2><p>Once protestors got to the area, Alderwoman Julia Ramirez (12th) said she saw another man taken by federal agents at this gas station nearby.</p><p>"Since then, there was one car that was at this gas station with a person, a US citizen, that has now been detained," Ramirez said.</p><p>All morning and into the afternoon there were tense moments between agents and protestors, with yelling, objects thrown, and officers spraying pepper balls.  </p>
<p>Groups of federal agents kept arriving on scene. Four to five undercover federal agents SUVs made their way through the crowd and go underneath tape. Each time they came through protestors fought back. </p><p>"If they are zooming through a crowd of protestors and they are doing it every five minutes to continue the irritation on people, it's almost like they want people to be provoked," Ramirez said.</p><p>At one point a military vehicle pulled up near the protestors and an agent drew his gun from the roof pointing it at protestors below.</p><p>"Now they got the SWAT truck here like we are like the military now, this is like a war zone here," Gabriel said. </p><p>DHS accused Chicago police of not helping during the incident, though Chicago police have no jurisdiction in Broadview. DHS also said in its statement that "there is a growing crowd and we are deploying special operations to control the scene."</p><p>Chicago police said in a statement they responded to the 3900 block of South Kedzie in the city's Brighton Park neighborhood for a report of a person shot. Brighton Park is several miles away from Broadview, where McLaughlin's statement said the shooting took place.</p><p>A second statement from DHS, a short time later, said Border Patrol officers were patrolling near 39th Place and S. Kedzie before repeating McLaughlin's statement that said the incident took place in Broadview. CBS News Chicago has reached out to DHS officials for clarification, but they have just referred us to their statement. </p>
<p>Chicago police said they responded to document the incident and to maintain safety and traffic control, but are not involved in the incident or investigation. CPD said federal authorities are investigating the shooting and "all further inquiries regarding the circumstances of this shooting should be referred to the appropriate federal authorities."</p><p>The FBI said in a social media post Saturday afternoon that, "Following recent events during immigration enforcement in Broadview, the FBI and our federal law enforcement and prosecutorial partners continue to aggressively pursue charges and investigate violence against officers, obstruction of justice, and destruction of federal property. Our office is committed to ensuring the safety of Chicago's streets and all of our neighborhoods."</p><p>CBS News Chicago has reached out to <span class="link">Broadview police</span> for more information and are waiting to hear back. </p>

<div class="article-title">Pritzker says Trump administration intends to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard members</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement on Saturday that the Trump administration intends to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard members after he was offered an ultimatum on troop deployment.</p><p>"This morning, the Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will," he said. "It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will."</p><p>The White House later confirmed the plans. </p><p>"Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has authorized 300 national guardsmen to protect federal officers and assets," Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement. "President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities." </p><p>This comes amid clashes between protesters and federal agents in Broadview, Illinois, where, within the past couple of weeks, over a dozen protesters were arrested, <span class="link">including seven on Friday</span>.</p>
<p>DHS said <span class="link">a woman was shot on Saturday</span> in Broadview after federal agents' cars were boxed in. Police, however, said the shooting took place in Brighton Park based on the address of the incident.</p><p>"They will pull hardworking Americans out of their regular jobs and away from their families all to participate in a manufactured performance -- not a serious effort the protect public safety. For Donald Trump, this has never been about safety. This is about control," Pritzker said. </p><p>On Friday, the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Border Patrol official Greg Bovino were in Chicago overseeing ICE operations. </p><p>"I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois," the governor said. "State, county, and local law enforcement have been working together and coordinating to ensure public safety around the Broadview ICE facility, and to protect people's ability to peacefully exercise their constitutional rights. I will not call up our National Guard to further Trump's acts of aggression against our people."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Pritzker said the Trump administration was seeking to <span class="link">deploy 100 troops to protect ICE in Illinois</span>. Pritzker this week also called for the 25th Amendment to be invoked after the president told senior military leaders that he had told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that cities like <span class="link">Chicago should serve as "training grounds" for troops</span>.</p><p>"In Illinois, we will do everything within our power to look out for our neighbors, uphold the Constitution, and defend the rule of law," Pritzker said. </p><p>CBS News Chicago has reached out to the Illinois National Guard and the Attorney General's Office, but has yet to hear back. </p>

<section class="content__body">
<p>Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez was arrested on multiple charges after being hospitalized following an incident in Indianapolis early Saturday morning, police said. </p><p>The 38-year-old Sanchez was arrested at a local hospital on suspicion of battery with injury, unlawful entry of a motor vehicle and public intoxication, all misdemeanors, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement posted to social media. </p><p>Sanchez remains hospitalized and has not been booked into jail, police said. </p><p>Sanchez's agent, Andrew Kessler, had previously told CBS News that Sanchez was is in stable condition and recovering in a hospital.  </p><p>"That is really all I know and can say," he said.</p>
<p>In an earlier statement, police said two adult men were involved in a "physical disturbance" around 12:30 a.m. local time. One man had suffered from apparent stab wounds and the other had sustained lacerations. Detectives said the two men appeared to know each other and the incident was not a random act of violence. They did not identify the victims, but said both were not local residents.</p>
<p>An analyst for FOX Sports, Sanchez was in town for the Colts vs. Raiders game at Lucas Oil Stadium scheduled for Sunday.</p><p>"We are deeply grateful to the medical team for their exceptional care and support," Fox News Sports said in a statement to CBS News." Our thoughts and prayers are with Mark, and we ask that everyone please respect his and his family's privacy during this time."</p><p>Police said the case will be presented to the Marion County Prosecutor's office for a charging decision. </p>
<p>A 2009 first-round draft pick out of the University of Southern California, Sanchez played quarterback for the New York Jets, Philadelphia Eagles and Chicago Bears, among other teams.  </p>

<div class="article-title">How new generations are learning the piano</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>There was a time when pianos were a fixture in many American homes. Gathering around the instrument to sing and dance was a family tradition, undoubtedly altered by the spread of streaming services and social media. </p><p>Despite plummeting sales in recent years, the piano continues to find its way into people's homes. </p><p>In 1925, it was estimated by the Blue Book of Pianos that 306,584 pianos were sold, while only 17,294 were sold in 2024, according to a music industry census. </p><p>Hannah Beckett, a piano technician in northern Virginia, can attest to the fact that fewer people are buying pianos.</p><p>"It's been a hard year," she said. "It's kind of a perfect storm of a lot of geopolitical events, economic status, general trends in the culture."</p>
<p>Beckett said people have been forced to make decisions that may not involve purchasing a pricey musical instrument.</p><p>"Millennials are struggling to get a house, let alone a piano to put in it," Beckett says.</p><p>One option is a digital piano, which offers a smaller, more affordable options to its acoustic counterpart. </p><p>"You still have people buying entry-level uprights and entry-level baby grands," says Chris Syllaba of Jordan Kitt's Music.  "But you still have many, many more times that number that are buying digital pianos or even hybrid pianos."</p>
<p>According to Beckett, a new generation learning on digital pianos isn't a bad thing. </p><p>"Because at least a digital you're going to have accurate sounds, accurate notes, the keys are going to go up and down," she explains, a problem that older acoustic pianos can pose for beginners. </p><p>Beckett is optimistic about the future of playing the instrument.</p><p>"At some point, you're going to start looking for musicality, for emotional expression, for shaping phrasing, for some of the things more advanced musicians are interested in," she says hopefully, adding, "we're going to see a resurgence of piano playing. I think we're all kind of weary of screens at this point." </p>

<div class="article-title">Israel says it has deported 137 flotilla activists amid large protests</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>More than 130 activists who were detained by Israel while taking part in an <span class="link">aid flotilla bound for Gaza</span> have been deported to Turkey, the Israeli foreign ministry said Saturday. </p><p>The agency said online that the 137 activists were from countries including the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy. Four Italian activists were deported on Friday. The foreign ministry said that Israel "seeks to expedite the deportation" of those detained from the flotilla. </p><p>The Global Sumud Flotilla set sail from Spain last month, with politicians and activists, including <span class="link">Greta Thunberg</span>, aboard. Nearly 50 vessels and 500 activists took part, CBS News previously reported. It was the largest attempt yet to break Israel's 18-year-long maritime blockade of Gaza, and aimed to bring food to Palestinians in the territory. Multiple drone attacks <span class="link">approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</span> targeted the flotilla as it sailed toward the territory, CBS News previously reported. </p><p>Most of the flotilla was intercepted by Israeli forces on Thursday. World leaders condemned the action, with Turkey's foreign ministry calling it a breach of international law. The vessels were sailing in international waters when they were intercepted, CBS News previously reported. The final boat in the flotilla was intercepted on Friday, the Associated Press reported. </p>
<p>Israel's foreign ministry called the detained activists "provocateurs," and said that some of them were "deliberately obstructing the legal deportation process, preferring instead to linger in Israel." The ministry also said that some foreign governments "have shown reluctance to accept flights that would return these provocateurs." Israel did not specify which activists were resisting deportation, or which countries were hesitating to accept flights.  </p>
<p>Israel's government has also accused some of the flotilla members of being linked to Hamas, while providing little evidence to support the claim. Members of the flotilla have strongly rejected the accusations and said Israel was trying to justify potential attacks on them.</p><p>Supporters of the flotilla took to the streets in major demonstrations around the world starting Thursday, according to the Associated Press. More than 2 million people in Italy took part in a one-day general strike meant to support Gazans on Friday. Tens of thousands of people are expected to attend a protest in Rome on Saturday.</p><p>In Spain, 70,000 people turned out for a demonstration in Barcelona. Events are also expected in Madrid and Lisbon, Portugal, the AP said. Officials in Greece are expecting protests in Athens on Saturday and Sunday. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hamas said in a statement Friday <span class="link">that it agreed to parts of a ceasefire deal</span> President Trump <span class="link">outlined earlier this week</span>. A U.S. official told CBS News that the United States views Hamas' response as positive, though there are still details that need to be hammered out. Netanyahu agreed to the deal on Monday. After Hamas released its statement, Mr. Trump said on Truth Social that he believes the group is "ready for a lasting PEACE" and pushed Israel to "immediately stop the bombing of Gaza." </p>
<p>An official who was not authorized to speak to the media on the record told the Associated Press that Israel has moved to a defensive-only position in Gaza and will not actively strike. The official said no forces have been removed from the strip.  </p><p>Israel and Hamas have been at war since <span class="link">Oct. 7, 2023</span>, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.</p><p>Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.</p>

<div class="article-title">Some Democrats share Trump's goal of forcing more homeless people into medical care</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>PORTLAND, Oregon —<strong> </strong>On a sunny late-summer afternoon, Logan Whalen stood outside his barbershop in downtown Portland. Two homeless people who were huddled in a doorway nearby were using illegal drugs. He said drug deals sometimes happen openly on his block. "I'm tired of it. It's mostly a nuisance, but it can also get a little bit scary," he said. </p> <p>Portland is nothing like the "war zone" that President Trump has described in recent speeches while calling for a deployment of National Guard troops in the city. It's a foodie town, with high-end shops, restaurants and boutiques. On this day, the business district was busy with locals and tourists.  </p>
<p>But after years of effort by local officials, on many streets there are still signs of homelessness, often complicated by severe addiction and mental illness.  Whalen described one recent encounter where a homeless person blew fentanyl smoke in his face.  </p>
<p>"I'm gay, very much a liberal Democrat, but compassion fatigue is a big thing," he said. "I don't want to walk on the street [to avoid homeless people]. I want to walk on the sidewalk."</p> <p>Trump's answer to growing frustration, and fear, over America's homelessness crisis includes a plan to expand use of a legal process known as civil commitment. He says that in more cases, judges should be able to force people to accept medical care for addiction and mental illness.</p> <p>"Our once-great cities have become unlivable, unsanitary nightmares, surrendered to the homeless, the drug-addicted and the violent and dangerously deranged," Trump said in a campaign video posted in April 2023. "For who those are severely mentally ill and deeply disturbed, we will bring them back to mental institutions, where they belong."</p>
<p>In July, Trump signed an executive order urging local and state governments to make this kind of forced medical care significantly more common. "Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order," he said. </p>
<h3 class="edTag">Democrats and Republicans move to expand civil commitment</h3>
<p>As the United States' homelessness crisis has deepened, Trump isn't alone in believing this kind of intervention should be used more often.  </p> <p>Most states already have some form of civil commitment law. The process is typically used only in rare cases, when individuals pose an immediate threat to themselves or others. Judges may force individuals to accept closely monitored outpatient care; in other cases, they may be institutionalized in hospitals or residential care facilities, usually for brief periods.</p> <p>California, New York and now Oregon are among states led by Democrats that have moved to expand use of forced medical care. Another blue state, Massachusetts, has one of the highest rates of involuntary commitments in the U.S. for people facing drug addiction.  <strong> </strong></p> <p>Oregon Democratic state Rep. Jason Kropf, who crafted his state's new law, says he embraced the idea after seeing families and communities struggle.  </p> <p>"How do you balance helping people in crisis who aren't able to help themselves with not abusing that ability to over-institutionalize people?" Kropf said.   </p> <p>Judy Thompson, a longtime advocate for mental illness services in Oregon, lobbied in favor of the new standards. She, too, came to believe that civil commitment should be used more often after her son's bipolar schizoaffective disorder spiraled out of control in 2019. The episode led to a dangerous car crash.</p>
<p>No one was killed, but Thompson said her son put people in grave danger and he ended up with a criminal record, before a judge finally agreed to send him to a mental hospital. "We need some wiggle room [in the law so judges can act] before things collapse and end up in this horrific nightmare," Thompson said.</p> <p>Thompson's son, Alton Aanderud, said he agrees that civil commitment was an important intervention that forced him to accept the medical help he needed. But he also said being hospitalized, even for relatively short periods of time, is disruptive and disorienting.</p>
<p>"It's not just, throw them all in an institution," he said. "When I got out of Oregon State Hospital, I had nothing when I came home — no place to live, one pair of pants, one shirt," he said. "It's disheartening when you go, 'Geez, I'm back at square one again.'"</p> <p>With his mother's help, Aanderud was able to rebuild his life and now lives independently in his own apartment. But he says many homeless people don't have that kind of support network. </p> <p>"Civil commitment is very scary because you don't know what you're getting into. They treat you, you get somewhat stabilized — then you're out the door and left to manage yourself," he said.</p> <p>Many experts interviewed by NPR agree that civil commitment, even when expanded, should be used sparingly. Some voiced alarm at Trump's goal of using forced medical care to "restore public order," especially if it leads to people being institutionalized for long periods. </p> <p>"What we don't want is to simply look at these folks as <em>They're annoying. They're on the streets. Let's lock them up where nobody can ever see them again</em>," said Dr. Kenneth Minkoff, a psychiatrist and nationally recognized expert on government-mandated health care. "That's not OK."</p> <p>Many people who study addiction and mental illness said they believe most homeless Americans should be helped with less invasive programs, including affordable health care and housing subsidies.</p> <p>"We are talking about using a sledgehammer, removing people's freedom in institutions, in facilities which don't even exist," said Morgan Godvin, a drug policy researcher who spent years on the streets of Portland addicted to heroin, before recovering. "Why are we going to the most expensive thing, that is most concerning for people's civil liberties?"</p> <h3 class="edTag">If more homeless people are institutionalized, who will pay?</h3>
<p>One unanswered question in Trump's call for a national effort to expand civil commitment and long-term institutionalization is who would pay for it? There aren't enough residential facilities or trained medical personnel to care for even a tiny fraction of the 270,000 Americans who, according to federal data, live on the streets.</p>
<p>Republicans in Congress have actually cut roughly $900 billion from Medicaid, the government insurance program that pays for most addiction treatment and mental health care in the United States. </p>
<p>Trump administration officials told NPR they believe taxpayer dollars have been wasted by Democrats on "woke" liberal responses to homelessness, including "housing first" subsidies and "harm reduction" addiction programs. Trump's executive order calls for diverting some of those funds.</p> <p>"Honestly, we think we can solve this without more money," said a senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "Part of it's simply accountability. We want federal dollars used more efficiently."</p> <p>Kropf, the Oregon state representative who pushed for Oregon's expanded civil commitment law, disagrees. He points out that Oregon has already budgeted $65 million to pay for new residential facilities to help care for people who may be forced into the health care system under the state's new civil commitment guidelines.   </p> <p>"It's the question everybody should be asking," Kropf said. "If we're going to change the standard, do we have the ability to execute on that standard and make sure people get the services they need?"  </p> <p>Minkoff, the expert on institutionalization, said homeless people with severe addiction and mental illness will be costly to treat.  </p> <p>Many have complex medical needs and require support after they've been stabilized to prevent them from winding up back on the street.</p> <p>"We need more resources as it is," he said. "These are folks who often, even when they're better, they're extremely vulnerable. They need appropriately ongoing supportive housing. There simply are not enough of those [programs] with adequate resources." </p> <p>Thompson, the advocate and mother who lobbied for Oregon's expanded civil commitment standards, is also wary of Trump's executive order.  </p> <p>She thinks Oregon's new law is well crafted and nuanced and includes limitations on the amount of time an individual can be hospitalized.  </p>
<p>But Thompson worries that many states will expand civil commitment and forced institutionalization in ways designed to sweep homeless people with addiction and mental illness out of sight.</p> <p>"It's like, throw the garbage away — these people are worthless," she said. "It can be used for good or bad. It can be used to help or to harm."</p> <p>Supporters and critics of expanding civil commitment say they agree the test will come in the details of how each state law is crafted. The White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believe Trump's executive order will be implemented in ways that help more people escape homelessness while respecting their rights.</p>

<div class="article-title">Federal judge temporarily blocks Trump's National Guard deployment to Portland</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A federal judge in Portland, Ore. temporarily blocked President Trump from federalizing 200 members of the state's National Guard.</p> <p>U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut ruled that the government didn't meet the threshold for declaring recent ongoing protests outside an ICE facility in Portland a rebellion. She noted in her ruling that the Portland Police Bureau's 812 officers are trained in crowd management and First Amendment law. She also noted their mutual aid agreements with neighboring law enforcement agencies, as well as with the Oregon State Police and federal law enforcement, signaling that they had protests well in hand. </p>
<p>"If additional resources beyond all of these are critically needed, PPB may request that Oregon's Governor provide National Guard resources for a locally declared emergency," she wrote.</p> <p>Since July, the judge's ruling said, the protests generally were limited to fewer than 30 people and were "largely sedate." </p> <p>The ruling stated the Trump administration "presented evidence of sporadic violence against federal officers and property damage to a federal building." Immergut wrote that the government has not, however, offered any evidence demonstrating that those violent incidents were part of an organized attempt "to overthrow the government as a whole."</p> <p>Immergut was appointed by President Trump in 2019.</p> <p>A broader lawsuit filed Sept. 28 by the city and state asking the courts to declare Trump's deployment unlawful will move forward separately on a slower track.</p> <p>The judge's decision in Portland comes as the administration deploys the National Guard to a number of American cities. Trump has sent troops to Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and will soon send them to Memphis, Tennessee with the state's approval. </p> <p>He's threatened to send them to Chicago, despite objections from city and state leaders there. Louisiana's Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, meanwhile, has requested troops to help with "high crime rates" in cities like New Orleans.</p>
<p>President Trump has said the deployments are needed to protect ICE agents as they carry out his mass deportation operations, as well as to reduce street crime. That's even though crime in some of the cities mentioned has been going down – including in Portland. The deployment to California was the first time in 60 years – since they were sent to protect civil rights activists in Alabama -- that a president deployed the National Guard over the objections of a state's governor.</p> <h3 class="edTag" id="Trump">Trump turned to Portland last week</h3> <p>President Trump announced on Sept. 27 his plan to send troops to "war ravaged Portland." In his social media post, the president said he was "authorizing Full Force, if necessary" to deal with "domestic terrorists." Trump did not specify what he meant by "Full Force."</p> <p>In court documents, the Trump administration argued it was necessary to federalize the National Guard to protect federal personnel at an ICE facility in Portland that has "experienced significant unrest targeting both the facility itself and those who work in it."</p> <p>State and local officials reject the idea that the situation on the ground requires the National Guard – saying protests outside the ICE facility have been small with no arrests by Portland Police in months until Trump's decision to federalize Oregon's Guard.</p> <p>By day, legal observers, clergy and leaders from other religious and spiritual denominations stand outside the building, prepared to assist people showing up for required "check-ins" with ICE officials. By night, a small group of protesters – sometimes a dozen or fewer – have demonstrated outside the building.</p> <p>Typically, says Portland's Police Chief Bob Day, they have largely been nonviolent and contained.</p> <p>"The city of Portland is 145 square miles. And this is one city block," Day told reporters Monday. "And even the events that are happening down there do not rise to the level of attention that they are receiving."</p>
<h3 class="edTag" id="Local">Local officials say the protests had already dwindled</h3> <p>The protests are much smaller than the scores of people who for months in 2020 gathered at the federal courthouse in downtown Portland following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.</p> <p>On September 28, the State of Oregon and City of Portland sued to block the Trump administration from deploying troops to the state's largest city.</p> <p>"In furtherance of a nationwide campaign to incorporate the military into civilian law enforcement—while also seeking to punish select, politically disfavored jurisdictions—they are preparing to deploy troops in Portland, Oregon," attorneys for the city and state wrote in their motion for a restraining order filed Monday. "The facts do not remotely justify this overreach."</p> <p>In the same document, they said the Portland Police Bureau made 25 arrests at the ICE facility between June 11 and June 19 of this year, but hadn't had cause to make any more until administration announced they were deploying the National Guard. After the President's announcement Saturday, two more people were arrested Sunday. Cammilla Wamsley, a regional ICE supervisor, said in a sworn statement that federal law enforcement made more than 20 arrests over roughly three weeks this summer, separate from arrests by local police.</p> <p>"On any given weekend," attorneys for the city and state wrote, "the nightlife in Portland's entertainment district has required PPB to dedicate greater resources than the small protests outside the ICE facility."</p> <h3 class="edTag" id="Trump">Trump lawyers maintain federal agents are under threat</h3> <p>Lawyers for the administration countered in their own court documents that the deployment was justified because protests in Portland required the facility to close for about three weeks in June and July. They say protesters blocked the entrance, spray painted threats and doxed ICE agents online.</p> <p>"Agitators have assaulted federal law enforcement officers with rocks, bricks, pepper spray and incendiary devices. They have damaged federal property, including by breaking office windows, security cameras, and card readers permitting entry to the building," they said.</p>
<p>On Friday, the administration announced it was investigating how Portland police have handled anti-ICE protests.</p> <p>Records provided to the court by the city of Portland show throughout September before Trump made his announcement, protests rarely drew more than a few dozen people. The records show police were in regular communication with federal officers at the Portland ICE facility.</p> <p>There were nights with incidents, such as Sept 20 when Portland Police noted that a Federal Protective Service officer called them "throughout the night with info about black blockers assaulting people." "Black bloc" groups wear black clothing and face coverings.</p> <p>But the records show the majority of nights were calm, like the night before Trump's Sept. 27 announcement to send in the National Guard, when Portland police observed 8-15 people at any given time: "Mostly sitting in lawn chairs and walking around." Portland Police wrote, "Energy was low, minimal activity."</p> <h3 class="edTag" id="Courts">Courts have been deliberating over the National Guard in California  </h3> <p>This is not the first time that the courts have weighed in on Trump's deployment of the National Guard over the objections of local officials. In June, Trump sent 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to confront protests against ICE operations. A federal judge ruled that the situation there did not constitute a level of interference with ICE or a "rebellion" against federal authority to justify sending in the troops.</p> <p>But an appeals court overruled that finding, citing instances where ICE agents were "pinned down" and had "concrete chunks" and "bottles of liquid" thrown at them. Oregon officials tried to draw a distinction there.</p> <p>"Those facts bear no resemblance to the recent ICE facility protests in Portland," attorneys representing Portland and Oregon argued when they asked the court to block the deployment. "If the relatively small, contained, and largely sedated protests near Portland's ICE facility in recent weeks can justify military intervention, then the President's authority to federalize a state's National Guard … would be virtually unlimited."</p>
<p>On Sept. 2, a California judge ruled that the troops in Los Angeles violated long-standing law against military forces performing civilian law enforcement by assisting ICE agents with traffic control and cordons for their operations. That ruling is now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p> <p><em>NPR's Larry Kaplow contributed to this story.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Largest US Lutheran denomination installs first Black presiding bishop</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop Saturday, a landmark moment for the predominantly white denomination.</p> <p>"It hasn't really hit me yet," Curry told The Associated Press a week before his installation. "The fact that you're a first."</p> <p>Curry succeeds the Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, who served for 12 years and was the first woman to lead the ELCA.</p> <p>During Eaton's tenure, Curry watched as the ELCA conference of bishops went from majority men to majority women.</p> <p>"I think her presence mattered," he said. "And I'm hopeful that if presence matters that we will start to see more and more leaders of color."</p>
<p>A formal ceremony at Central Lutheran Church in Minneapolis kicked off Curry's six-year term, which began Oct. 1. He was elected at the ELCA Churchwide Assembly on July 30 in Phoenix.</p>
<p>American Lutheranism is often stereotyped by its Scandinavian and German roots and concentration in the upper Midwest. By some measures, the ELCA is more than 95% white. But it has invested in local congregations of color and multicultural ministries, while maintaining ties to growing Lutheran churches globally.</p> <p>"He is representing a very white denomination as a Black man from the United States. I think it's a daunting, daunting call," said the Rev. Leila Ortiz, a friend who recently finished a term as ELCA bishop of the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., Synod. "I trust him, and I trust God and I can't wait to watch."</p> <p>As leader of the largest American Lutheran Church body, Curry will face challenges common to other mainline Protestant denominations, which in recent years have weathered theological disputes over LGBTQ+ inclusion and precipitous membership declines. The ELCA has dropped from 5.3 million members in 1988 to 2.7 million members today.</p> <p>Since 2009, the ELCA has blessed same-sex marriages and welcomed LGBTQ+ clergy, elevating its first openly gay regional bishop in 2013 and its first openly transgender regional bishop in 2021.</p>
<p>Curry, 53, is only the fifth presiding bishop of the ELCA, which formed from a merger of denominations in 1988. Until his election, he was one of 65 synodal, or regional, bishops. He led the Metropolitan Chicago Synod, where the ELCA's headquarters is also located.</p> <h2 class="edTag"><strong>A unique path to Lutheran Church leadership</strong></h2> <p>Born the seventh of 11 children on the south side of Chicago, Curry grew up Catholic and attended Catholic schools through college. He was a social worker before becoming a public schoolteacher.</p> <p>When he and his wife first visited Shekinah Chapel, they were in their mid-twenties, and it was a fledging congregation in Chicago. "I never paid attention that it was in a Lutheran Church."</p> <p>The church had a mentoring program for young Black men and boys that he thought could serve some of his middle school students.</p> <p>"For me, it was the traditional Black worship experience except it was a little bit more contemporary," he said. "There was poetry, there was liturgical dance, there was a band and praise and worship."</p> <p>Shekinah Chapel grew from an ELCA program to an official congregation. Curry went from a lay leader to a more formal leadership role while going to seminary. He was ordained within the ELCA in 2009.</p> <p>"That's uncommon where you get to lead in a place where you've been raised," Curry said. "I now recognize how fortunate I am."</p> <p>He was part of the Theological Education for Emerging Ministries (TEEM) program, which the ELCA says prepares ministers in "ethnic-specific, multicultural, rural and inner-city settings."</p>
<p>His path to ministry highlights one way of growing new and diverse congregations within older church structures.</p> <h2 class="edTag"><strong>The diversity of Lutherans</strong></h2> <p>Curry's forerunners as African American Lutheran leaders include the Rev. Nelson Wesley Trout, the first Black ELCA synod bishop, and the Rev. Will Herzfeld, a Black presiding bishop for a predecessor ELCA denomination.</p> <p>"Blacks have been around the Lutheran Church since it presented itself in New Amsterdam in the 1600s. We have been present in some small way from the beginning," said the Rev. James Thomas, a retired ELCA seminary professor and author of "A Rumor of Black Lutherans."</p>
<p>Around the globe, the largest and fastest-growing Lutheran churches are in Africa.</p> <p>A benefit of Curry's leadership is that it can help elevate "the fact that African Americans have been contributing to Lutheranism for a very long time, and not just here in the United States but around the world and in Africa," said the Rev. Yolanda Denson-Byers, who wrote "See Me, Believe Me," a book on the challenges leaders of color face in the mainly white ELCA.</p> <p>Bishop Regina Hassanally of the ELCA Southeastern Minnesota Synod said Curry's elevation is a dual call — for him and the denomination.</p> <p>"There can be a temptation to think that calling a leader of color is enough," she said. "But the reality is that it means creating supports and infrastructure and actually allowing that person to lead out of all of their gifts and their full identity, not just one piece of their identity."</p> <p>Curry said his goals include exploring ways for the ELCA to be a more connected church, from local congregations up through the hierarchy. Along with being a welcoming and thriving church, it's one of the goals the denomination has already set.</p> <p>"Sometimes you come up with these unique statements and strategies, but then we move on as transition happens," he said. "I want to take something that we've affirmed already and maybe dig a little deeper."</p>

<div class="article-title">National parks caught in the crosshairs of government shutdown</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>As Congress remains at an impasse on an agreement to fund government operations, several sites under the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt.</p> <p>Across the country, parks have been forced to close, operate under reduced staffing or rely on outside donations to keep the lights on as the shutdown stretches into its fourth day.</p> <p>The lack of a unified plan across all parks and sparse details outlined by official government resources has sparked confusion about which places parkgoers can visit or if the shutdown has caused sites to temporarily shutter their services.</p>
<p>"National parks remain as accessible as possible during the federal government shutdown," a notice on the NPS website reads.</p> <p>"However, some services may be limited or unavailable," it continues, with a link directing readers to a site with contingency plans outlining how funds would be appropriated during the shutdown.</p> <p>A contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails "will generally remain accessible to visitors" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.</p> <p>"As part of their orderly shutdown activities, park staff will post signs notifying visitors that only basic or no visitor services, maintenance, or other management activities will be conducted, and emergency services will be limited," according to the plan.</p> <p>At some park locations that collect fees, the memo stipulates that basic services can be provided such as those that maintain restrooms, collect trash and road maintenance.  </p> <p>But at some closed park locations, services will be stripped to the bone, including no trash collection, restrooms, road or walkway maintenance or visitor information.</p> <p>NPR reached out to the NPS on Saturday for comment but has not received a response.</p> <h2 class="edTag">States step in and donations for some relief</h2> <p>Several states have taken it into their own hands to see to it that their parks remain open during the federal funding spat, either directly funding the sites themselves or collecting third-party relief to help keep the doors open.</p>
<p>According to National Parks Traveler, parks in states including West Virginia, Utah and Hawaii, have managed to secure funds and donations necessary to keep operations temporarily rolling.</p>
<p>Visitors in other states have not been so lucky.</p> <p>Kathy Ten Eyck flew from Utica, New York into New Mexico to visit the glistening dunes of White Sands National Park. Instead, she was met with a notice of closure.</p> <p>"I just couldn't wait — could not wait to — get here," Ten Eyck said. "We stopped at the [PistachioLand] right up the street there, and that's where we heard that it was closed."</p> <p>Kathy Theriot was similarly heartbroken outside of the New Mexico Park. She had driven her children more than five hours from their home in Taos and hoped that they could experience the white sands she remembered from her childhood.</p> <p>"I've been waiting 10 years to show my kids White Sands and the day we come it's closed, which is very disappointing," Theriot said.</p> <p>"But it is really, really sad though that we get to the side of the road to enjoy part of our country because our elected officials can't get along."</p> <h2 class="edTag">Vandalism and safety concerns</h2>
<p>Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.</p> <p>Some of Texas' famed national parks, such as Big Bend and Padre Island National Seashore, will remain open during this time but may have limited staffing, according to Texas Public Radio (TPR).</p> <p>A previous government shutdown, TPR reported, saw an ancient rock at Big Bend vandalized amid the lack of staffing.</p>
<p>Those concerns have caused some park advocates to recommend all parks with a reduction in force be closed until federal funding is sorted.</p> <p>"Keeping our national parks open after Trump and Republicans forced a government shutdown is stupid, short-sighted and incredibly dangerous," said Stephanie Kurose, deputy director of government affairs at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement.</p> <p>"We've seen the irreparable harm that can happen when our parks go understaffed. Vandalism, trash and human waste will tarnish natural treasures that are the envy of the world. But apparently nothing says 'Make America Great Again' like turning Yosemite into one giant toilet."</p>
<p>During the last government shutdown, which began in December 2018 during Trump's previous administration and lasted a record 35 days, several of America's beloved national parks reported significant damage, including California's Joshua Tree National Park, which saw trees cut down and new roads illegally dug in.</p> <p>The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) has also called for parks to be closed, citing past problems during government shutdowns that led to vandalism, sanitation issues and ecological harm.</p> <p>"The government has shut down, and the administration is once again putting our national parks and visitors at risk, effectively directing staff to open park gates and walk away," NPCA president and CEO Theresa Pierno said in a statement. "It's not just irresponsible, it's dangerous."</p> <p><em>NPR's Ava Pukatch contributed to this report.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Trump urges Hamas to 'move quickly' on Gaza peace plan</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>President Trump hailed an apparent reduction in Israeli military strikes on Gaza, as U.S. negotiators travel to Cairo to meet with Egyptian, Qatari and Hamas negotiators in a bid to end the two-year conflict.</p> <p>In a social media post on Saturday, Trump urged Hamas to "move quickly" to take advantage of the latest respite in Israel's combat operations, insisting he would "not tolerate delay" from the group, and warning that, absent a swift agreement, "all bets will be off."</p> <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that he hopes Hamas will have returned all remaining hostages by Oct. 13 — the end of an upcoming Jewish holiday.</p>
<p>"It is not final yet, we are working on it diligently, and, God willing, I hope that in the coming days, during the Sukkot holiday, I will be able to announce to you the return of all our hostages, the living and the fallen alike, in a single operation, while the IDF remains in the depth of the Strip and in the areas that control it," Netanyahu said in a statement.</p>
<p>A hospital official seemed to confirm Saturday that Israel's bombing of Gaza City had "significantly subsided" after weeks of intensive strikes on the devastated territory's largest urban center.</p> <p>However, the Shifa Hospital director, Mohamed Abu Selmiyah, told the Associated Press that medical teams had nonetheless recorded the deaths of at least five Palestinians, and NPR's Anas Baba noted at least three airstrikes overnight into Saturday.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the White House unveiled a 20-point peace plan, to which Hamas subsequently agreed, at least in part.</p> <p>One of the initial measures was a requirement for the group to immediately release all remaining hostages within three days of the plan's implementation.</p> <p>Following Hamas' public acceptance of that provision, Trump said Friday that Israel "must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza" to allow the group to fulfill that obligation to release hostages.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, facing mounting international and domestic pressure, Netanyahu issued a rare late-night statement on Friday, the Jewish Sabbath, that acknowledged a commitment to end the war in line with Trump's plans.</p>
<p>Israeli leaders ordered the country's military to reduce its activity in Gaza "to a minimum" and to carry out defensive actions only, a person briefed by an Israeli official told NPR. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plan publicly.</p> <p>Though Israeli forces will continue to encircle Gaza City, this lull in combat operations is intended to allow Hamas members to locate the 48 remaining hostages, the Israeli military said, with fewer than half of those estimated to be still alive.</p> <p>Since many of the hostages have died, Hamas officials have warned that locating and digging up the remains may take longer than the 72 hours allotted.</p> <p>U.S. presidential envoy Steve Witkoff said he will travel to Egypt to head the American negotiating team, accompanied by Trump's son-in-law and former adviser Jared Kushner.</p> <p>Those talks will likely focus on the positioning of Israeli forces during a phased withdrawal from Gaza, humanitarian aid, and the scale of a prisoner exchange of Palestinians held in Israeli detention, in return for the hostages still inside Gaza.</p>
<p>Hamas has also signaled that for discussions to succeed it will require approval from other Palestinian factions, including Gaza's second largest armed group, Islamic Jihad, which this week eventually backed Hamas' acceptance of Trump's latest plan.</p> <p>Protests demanding an end to the war have occurred across Europe, as Gaza's Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll since the war began — including both combatants and civilians — has topped 67,000.</p> <p>Israel's main opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on social media that he backs Trump's proposal and would support the Israeli government's implementation of it.</p>
<p>A group speaking for the families of some hostages said the chances of their loved ones returning "has never been closer."</p> <p><em>NPR's Emily Feng contributed reporting from Tel Aviv and Anas Baba contributed reporting from Gaza.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Populist billionaire Andrej Babiš wins Czech parliamentary election</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>PRAGUE — Billionaire Andrej Babiš became another populist leader in Central Europe to stage a political comeback by winning big in the Czech Republic's parliamentary election, according to nearly complete results Saturday.</p> <p>That result could steer the country away from supporting Ukraine and toward Hungary and Slovakia, which have taken a pro-Russian path.</p> <p>With the results of 99.5% of the polling stations counted by the Statistics Office, Babiš' ANO (YES) movement captured 34.7% of the vote, soundly beating the Together conservative coalition of Prime Minister Petr Fiala that received 23.2%.</p>
<p>Babiš was jubilant after his best electoral result, calling it "historic" for himself and his "catch-all" political group since it stormed into national politics in 2013.</p> <p>"We want the Czech Republic to become the best place for life in the European Union and we will do everything to make it happen," he told his supporters and media.</p> <p>With the victory, Babiš would join the ranks of Prime Ministers Viktor Orbán of Hungary and Robert Fico of Slovakia, whose countries have refused to provide military aid to Ukraine, continue to import Russian oil and oppose European Union sanctions on Russia.</p> <p>The Czech Republic has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. The country has donated arms, including heavy weapons to the Ukrainian armed forces and is behind an initiative that acquires artillery shells Ukraine badly needs from countries outside the EU.</p> <p>"We don't like it," Babiš said about that internationally recognized initiative. "We have a different view of it," he said.</p> <p>The opposition led by Babiš blamed Fiala for all the troubles of recent years, from the energy crisis to soaring inflation, and pledged to revoke his pension reform and help for Ukraine.</p> <p>Fiala congratulated him, saying the result was clear and "it's necessary to accept it."</p>
<p>His campaign focused on security amid the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>A group of mayors known as STAN, also a member of Fiala's government, had 11.1% of the vote, with another ally of Fiala, the Pirates party, reaching 8.7%.</p>
<p>The major anti-migrant force, the Freedom and Direct Democracy party, got 7.9% while a right-wing group calling itself the Motorists collected 6.8%.</p> <p>Babiš said his aim was to form a one-party government and he will have to seek tolerance from the two groups.</p> <p>The two-day election filled 200 seats in the lower house of the Czech parliament. Babiš won 80 seats, the Freedom Party has 15 and the Motorists 13. The Together coalition won 52.</p> <p>He joined forces with his friend Orbán last year to create a new alliance in the European Parliament, the "Patriots for Europe," to represent hard-right groups, a significant shift from the liberal Renew group that Babiš previously belonged to.</p> <p>The Patriots are united by anti-migrant rhetoric, a critical stance toward EU policies tackling climate change, and the protection of national sovereignty.</p> <p>The Motorists, who are backed by former EU-skeptic President Václav Klaus, share the views while the Freedom party wants to lead the country out of the EU and NATO and plans to expel almost all of some 380,000 Ukrainian refugees from the country.</p> <p>"We're clearly pro-European and pro-NATO," Babiš still declared after the victory.</p> <p>President Petr Pavel is scheduled to meet with Babiš and other party leaders on Sunday. The head of the strongest political force usually gets a chance from the president to form a new government.</p> <p>If he wants to govern alone, his minority Cabinet would need at least tacit support from the Freedom party and the Motorists to win a mandatory parliamentary confidence vote to rule.</p> <p>The result was a fiasco for a coalition of four far-left fringe parties led by the maverick Communists who are openly pro-Russian and failed to win a seat.</p>

<div class="article-title">Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>On Capitol Hill right now, there's a partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. That's where 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — buy health plans.</p> <p>The argument is at the heart of the government shutdown that started Oct. 1. </p> <p>Democratic lawmakers say extending enhanced premium tax credits is urgent, with open enrollment weeks away. Republican lawmakers say there's time to negotiate over a policy later, since the subsidies expire in December.</p> <p>Who's right?</p> <p>"The window is rapidly closing," says Jon Godfread, North Dakota's insurance commissioner. He says the enhanced subsidies need to be extended before open enrollment starts Nov. 1. "Let's do this now."</p>
<p>If lawmakers miss that deadline, he says, "it's going to be really, really challenging to go back [to consumers] and say, 'OK, now we fixed it, please come back and shop at this market that you were priced out of.' I just don't believe consumers are going to do that."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Insurance honchos in Red and Blue states all want it done</h3> <p>Godfread insists this issue is not about partisan politics. He himself is an elected Republican, and he is also president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a membership organization of state insurance regulators across the country. "Red state, blue state, appointed, elected — we have unanimous approval supporting these tax credits," he says.</p> <p>The insurance commissioners have been warning lawmakers about this impending problem for months. "Since January, to be honest — we've sent four different letters," he says. He also spent the whole month of May in Washington D.C. meeting with members of Congress and explaining how an expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits will hit consumers very hard — he calls it a "double hit."</p> <h3 class="edTag">From $800 to $3,000 a month in premiums</h3> <p>"We're seeing increases in premiums because health care costs are going up, but when you also take away these subsidies, you essentially pull the rug out from people," he says. "You're looking at a family that maybe was paying $800 a month for their health insurance and that jumps to $3,000."</p>
<p>Premiums on average would go up 114% for consumers, according to an analysis published this week by KFF, the nonpartisan health research organization.</p>
<p>In North Dakota, the people who will be affected are mostly farmers and ranchers, Godfread explains. "With these enhancements, we saw more farmers and ranchers purchasing coverage for their families, so it's been really, really good on that front," he says.</p> <p>According to KFF, more than 3 in 4 enrollees in these ACA plans live in states President Trump won in 2024. KFF also published a poll Friday that found that 78% of voters across the political spectrum are in favor of continuing the enhanced subsidies, including most Republicans and "Make American Great Again" supporters.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Time for 'action'</h3> <p>After a bumpy first decade, right now, the ACA insurance markets like Healthcare.gov are working pretty well, Godfread says. Consumers are happy with their options and find the plans affordable. If premiums spike for consumers and the healthiest people drop their coverage, "that really sickens and weakens the risk pool," he says. Plus, more uninsured people mean more uncompensated care for hospitals, which presents its own problems for state budgets.</p> <p>When he talks with lawmakers, Godfread says, sometimes they balk at the cost of the subsidies and at how expensive premiums have become. "That discussion is separate," he argues. "We can talk about the costs of health care and pharmaceuticals, all the pieces — but we've still got to get access to consumers, and that's what these subsidies have helped provide."</p> <p>He is hopeful lawmakers might act since, at last, there's more attention and awareness about the policy issue. "I'm happy we've had more conversations — we've got to get some action, though," he says.</p> <h3 class="edTag">States stand ready to respond</h3> <p>With open enrollment just a few weeks away — Nov. 1 everywhere except Idaho where it's Oct. 15 — health insurers have locked in their rates for 2026. But Godfread explains there's still an opportunity to give consumers the subsidized rates if Congress acts quickly.</p>
<p>"Most states, if not all states, had their [insurance] carriers file two sets of rates — one with subsidies, one without," he says. "And so if they do a clean extension of these subsidies, I think most states will be ready to go on that."</p>
<p>The key, again, is getting it done before open enrollment begins, he says, so that consumers see a rate they can afford when they log in to shop for a plan. "I don't see consumers taking multiple bites of this apple."<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Opinion: Jane Goodall helped humans understand their place in the world</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Outside the Field Museum in Chicago, a bronze sculpture by artist Marla Friedman captures a moment a friendship was made.</p> <p>It's called "The Red Palm Nut." A young woman sits barefoot on the ground, reaching out her hand to a chimpanzee, who sits about a yard away. And he lightly, seemingly shyly, takes her human fingers into his own. A bright, red palm nut has dropped on the soil between them.</p> <p>The woman in the sculpture is the great primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, at the moment she first earned the trust of a wild chimp. "He reached out and he took and dropped that palm nut," she later remembered. "But then very gently squeezed my fingers and that's how chimpanzees reassure each other. So in that moment we understood each other without the use of human words, the language of gestures."</p>
<p>Jane Goodall called the silvery-chinned chimp David Greybeard. She met him when she was in her 20s, a former secretary from Bournemouth, England, who saved cash tips she'd earned as a waitress to journey to Africa, where she talked herself into a job as assistant to the famed anthropologist Louis Leakey.</p> <p>She had no college experience. But Jane Goodall convinced Leakey she would be just the person to live among and study a group of chimpanzees he had discovered on the shores of Lake Tanganyika.</p> <p>And on what she recalled was a rainy morning, November 4, 1960, she saw David Greybeard and other chimps take twigs from a tree, pluck their leaves, and use them as sticks to pierce a termite mound and slurp the insects off the end — almost like how those primates called human beings might lick peanut butter off a spoon.</p> <p>What she saw and documented was startling: the chimps had made the twigs into tools. When she wrote about it to Louis Leakey, he famously replied, "We must now redefine man, redefine tools, or accept chimpanzees as humans."</p> <p>By the time Jane Goodall died this week, at the age of 91, she'd been honored around the world for her work with chimps and people, and established animal sanctuaries and forest conservation programs.</p>
<p>David Greybeard, I think she'd want us to note, died in 1968. Jane Goodall and her friend saw strangers in a jungle, reached out their hands, and began a friendship that changed how humans understood our place in the world.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>BOGOTÁ, Colombia — Manuel Alejandro Tique used to live in a peaceful condo on the outskirts of Bogotá, from where he would bike to his office in the center of the city several times a week. Now, he's in a maximum security prison in Venezuela, where inmates are rarely allowed to communicate with the outside world.</p> <p>"We are constantly worried about how he's doing," says his sister Diana Tique, who lives in the three-bedroom apartment that has been the family's home for years.</p> <p>She says that during the first months of her brother's detention, she had trouble sleeping, adding that the "emotional toll" of having him detained without trial in a foreign prison has been immense.</p>
<p>Manuel Tique, a 32-year-old humanitarian worker, is among a growing number of foreign nationals detained by Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian government as Venezuela faces economic sanctions and political isolation from the United States and Europe.</p> <p>With the U.S. now amassing naval forces and even blowing up several boats  in the southern Caribbean in an anti-narcotics mission that Maduro has described as the start of a potential attack on his government, relatives of the prisoners say they face a new level of uncertainty.</p>
<p>"I'm scared about the military pressure," says Manuel Tique's father, Víctor Manuel. "It might lead to freedom, but it could also mean Maduro holds these prisoners for longer."</p> <p>Venezuela's government has accused many of the foreigners in its prisons of plotting to overthrow President Maduro.</p> <p>But human rights groups say these prisoners are mostly tourists, business people and humanitarian workers who had nothing to do with Venezuelan politics.</p> <p>Juan Pappier, the deputy Americas director at Human Rights Watch, says that currently there are 89 foreign nationals imprisoned in Venezuelan jails, from countries that include Colombia, Spain, Argentina, France and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Venezuela released 10 Americans held in its jails in exchange for more than 200 Venezuelan migrants whom the U.S. had deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador.</p> <p>Pappier says that Venezuela intensified detentions of foreigners after its presidential election in 2024 — a vote that Maduro has been widely accused of stealing.</p>
<p>Dozens of countries did not recognize Maduro's reelection last year, with current White House officials describing the Venezuelan president as an "illegitimate" leader who heads a "narco-terror cartel." </p> <p>"It appears that the Venezuelan regime is holding these foreigners as hostages," Pappier says.</p> <p>"Foreign governments did the right thing by condemning the electoral fraud in 2024. And in response, the Maduro regime is extorting them by holding their nationals in prison and forcing them to engage with the Maduro regime for their release."</p>
<p>Manuel Tique was working for a humanitarian group called the Danish Refugee Council when he traveled to Venezuela last year. He had been asked to deliver a workshop to local aid groups on how to monitor food and medicine distribution.</p> <p>But Tique was arrested at a border post while seeking entry into Venezuela, and was not heard from for weeks, in what amounts to a forced disappearance, according to human rights groups.</p> <p>"We lost contact with him on Sept. 14 [of last year]," says his sister Diana Tique. "And only got news of him on Oct. 17, when Venezuelan officials spoke about him on TV." Venezuela's powerful interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, accused Tique of being a mercenary who was in Venezuela to recruit fighters for an anti-government mission.</p> <p>In a year, Tique has only been allowed to make two phone calls. He's currently in a prison known as Rodeo One, where inmates are rarely allowed to leave their cells.</p>
<p>"It's heart-wrenching," says his father, Víctor Manuel, "because it's a situation that you cannot control."</p> <p>Human rights groups say that it's not clear what the Venezuelan government wants in exchange for Tique, or some of the other foreigners in Venezuelan jails.</p> <p>But some say that as Maduro's grip on power comes under pressure, his government is likely to take more prisoners.</p> <p>"It's an act of desperation," says David Guillaume, a nurse from Florida who spent four months in Rodeo One — and shared a cell with Tique, where the two inmates coped with boredom and anxiety by playing chess with pieces they made out of toilet paper.</p> <p>Guillaume says he was arrested in September of last year after trying to enter Venezuela as a tourist.</p> <p>He was freed in January, along with five other Americans, after a Trump envoy met with Maduro and discussed possible economic sanctions relief.</p>
<p>"My American privilege kind of made me chill, because I realized I wasn't going to be there for a long time," Guillaume says. "So I tried to learn the names and nationalities of the people there" to relay the information to foreign governments and human rights groups.</p> <p>But while negotiations to free prisoners have worked in some cases, they can also make things worse, says Laura Dib, a human rights lawyer at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), a think tank and advocacy group.</p> <p>"It actually creates a very dangerous environment in which anyone can be detained," Dib says, adding that the Venezuelan government has realized there are benefits from keeping international hostages.</p> <p>"Seeking other ways to pressure without necessarily negotiating and giving an authoritarian government what they want is very, very important," she says.</p>
<p>Dib points out that several nations are now issuing travel warnings, telling their citizens not to go to Venezuela as a result of the large number of foreigners imprisoned there without trial.</p> <p>Back in Bogotá, the Tique family says they want the Colombian government to be more vocal about the release of its citizens — and to link trade and security cooperation to their freedom.</p> <p>But with American naval forces gathering off Venezuela's coast, fears are intensifying over what this growing show of force could mean for the prisoners — trapped between fragile diplomacy and the prospect of armed confrontation.</p> <p>"What has happened to us is an injustice," says Víctor Manuel Tique. "And it doesn't help to improve Venezuela's situation."</p>

<div class="article-title">Here's how the fashion industry is using AI to predict the next big trend</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Predicting what matters in fashion was once an elite sport, the province of those who attend those big runway shows in New York, Milan, London, and – right now – Paris, like the editors of influential magazines. (A line from 2006's <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>, about Miranda Priestly, a tyrannical fashion editor, conveys the idea succinctly: "You still don't get it do you? Her opinion is the only one that matters.")</p> <p>While elite opinions continue to carry weight, the trend prediction game has expanded enormously over the past decade. Platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Pinterest are redefining how trends spread. According to a report from the data company Launchmetrics, more than 40% of global consumers purchased apparel and accessories at least three times via social media in 2024.<em> </em></p>
<p>"There is more information available, certainly," said Amy Sullivan, vice president of buying and private brands at the online fashion retailer and styling service Stitch Fix. "And I think the trends because of social media move faster."</p>
<p>With so much data floating around, fashion industry players are leaning on AI in order to remain competitive.</p> <p>Sullivan said AI recently helped her team decide whether to go with a red or blue stripe shirt for next Spring.</p> <p>"In the past, to answer that question, you either make a spot decision without really looking at it, or you're requesting samples from vendors overseas that could take weeks and cost a lot of money," Sullivan said. "But when this happened a few weeks ago, we just put it into AI and you can actually see it in a full on-body image and make the right decision."</p> <p>They went with the blue.</p> <h3 class="edTag">How AI is used to make predictions</h3> <p>AI algorithms are helping the fashion industry on a number of fronts including the creation of personalized customer experiences, such as allowing customers to "try on" clothes virtually, supply chain management, and image generation. Its use in figuring out what's likely to fly off racks next season involves mining data from many different places.</p>
<p>"Our models track everything from runway shows to social media," said Noémie Voyer, the fashion expertise lead at Heuritech. The Paris-based company works with such brands as New Balance, Skims and Prada. "We have a massive scale of data that allows our AI to detect early signals of trends – sometimes months before they become visible on the mainstream market."</p> <p>Voyer said her company's algorithms successfully predicted a bunch of emerging trends for next year. Examples include dotted prints, the flat-thong sandal and the color yellow. These trends have all shown up on runways at this year's fashion weeks. Eventually, they'll appear in Target and H&amp;M.</p>
<p>But Voyer and the other sources NPR spoke with for this story all agree that AI cannot do fashion prediction on its own.</p> <p>"While our AI is extremely sophisticated, the human [aspect] still remains essential," Voyer said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Human expertise is still necessary</h3> <p>"We can use AI to supercharge what we do," said Francesca Muston, chief forecasting officer at the global consumer trend forecasting company, WGSN, which counts Levi's and Coach among its clients. "But you have to really start putting a lot of rigor and a lot of process into what you're doing."</p>
<p>Muston said AI is excellent at efficiently predicting things like how much of a popular item a retailer should stock. But she said her company's human experts have to ensure the information the AI provides doesn't lead to the wrong conclusions.</p> <p>"When you are looking online at social media, trends can blow up and feel huge," Muston said. "But entertainment and commerciality are two different things."</p> <p>Muston said it's one thing for an entertaining fashion post on social media to get a lot of engagement. But it's quite another for someone to go out and buy the featured item: "Are they actually going to go away and spend some money and wear it to the bar after work?"</p>
