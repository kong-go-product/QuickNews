<div class="article-title">With hostages freed, Trump thanks others in Israel speech but is too quick to declare war is over</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>It was a speech unlike any other President Trump has delivered.</p><p>After freeing the Hamas hostages – a moment of pure joy – he spent most of his address to the Israeli parliament praising others.</p><p>There was constant applause at the Knesset in Jerusalem yesterday as Trump invoked "the almighty God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob" – and then hailed more modern figures.</p><p>Bibi Netanhayu. Marco Rubio. Pete Hegseth. Jared Kushner (mentioning that his daughter Ivanka had converted to Judaism to marry him). Various generals. And Steve Witkoff – he went on and on about the talents of his Mideast envoy and his four-hour meeting with Vladimir Putin.</p><p>The president also said he’d gotten invaluable help from Arab and Muslim nations as he envisioned "peace, God willing, for all eternity."</p><p>All eternity is a long time – and while Trump didn’t exactly land on an aircraft carrier with a Mission Accomplished banner, à la George W. Bush, he explicitly said he views the war as over.</p><p>Watching the Israeli footage of some of the 20 freed hostages tearfully embracing family members, it was impossible not to be moved. Even when watching it a second or third time, given the horrifying ordeal they have endured. If your heart wasn’t stuck in your throat, you don’t have a heart.</p><p>As Trump loosened up and began ad-libbing, the message was clear: He was the one who had orchestrated this peace deal. He was also careful to blame the war on the "heinous" Oct. 7 massacre by the Hamas terrorists, causing the greatest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust. </p><p>Still, Trump couldn’t restrain himself from taking partisan shots at Joe Biden and Barack Obama. </p><p>He really went off-script late in the hourlong speech by turning to Israel’s president and suggesting he give Netanyahu a pardon. Bibi is the defendant in a long-running corruption trial that has been dragged out in part because of the two-year war.</p><p>I was among the first to observe last week that Trump’s international peacemaking was in stark contrast to his refusal to negotiate with Democrats to end the government shutdown that has stretched into its second week. Peace abroad but not at home. But right now the red-hot media spotlight is on the Mideast.</p><p>When Trump was running out of people to thank, he praised Israel’s opposition leader, Yair Lapid. And he spotted Miriam Adelson, the widow of billionaire Sheldon Adelson, and coaxed her into standing up, as they regularly visited Trump on Israel’s behalf. </p><p>You know who is praising Trump? Hillary Clinton. Rahm Emanuel. Condoleezza Rice. Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan. John Fetterman (You know who won’t mention his name? Obama, called out by CNN).</p><p>Trump was even drawing plaudits on MSNBC from the likes of Jon Meacham and Ben Rhodes, at least for the short-term win.</p><p>One can detest a president of the other party, or other ideological divide, and still applaud when he does something that’s good for America and the world. </p><p>Trump knows full well the difficulties ahead, which is why he left for Egypt to sign the deal and conduct further negotiations with Arab leaders.</p><p>On CNN, on MSNBC, on Fox, which got an exclusive pull-aside interview with Trump, the tone was much the same – upbeat, celebratory, filled with praise, but also wary of what comes next – and those are fair journalistic questions.</p><p>Some former Israeli officials and journalists said this could have been achieved a year or 18 months ago, but that Netanyahu wanted to keep fighting. Trump agreed that Netanyahu wanted to keep fighting, calling him a tough man to deal with, and forced him to accept the peace plan by threatening to walk away. He even forced Bibi to apologize to Qatar for attacking the exiled Hamas leadership there. Without almost breaking Bibi’s arm, none of this would have happened. </p><p>Check this out: Trump said in Egypt: "I want to thank the media, you’ve been so respectful," that he had listened to various newscasts on Air Force One, and they had been "all fair." Wowza.</p><p>This was during a pull-aside interview with Fox’s Trey Yingst, who’s been my guest so many times. "You are a real professional — not because it’s good or bad, you’re just really professional," Trump told him. "It would be great if other people could do what you do because they put negative spin" on the news.</p><p>Among other things, Trump said he wants to make a deal with Iran – which would horrify many Israelis – but spoke only briefly about the Council of Peace, which he would head and which would include Arab and European leaders. The U.S. would contribute 200 troops based outside Gaza. </p><p>Taking press questions with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, Trump projected optimism about Phase 2 of the process. But he knows it’s no cakewalk, to borrow a phrase from a Bush defense adviser, Ken Adelman, whose Washington Post op-ed said "Cakewalk in Iraq" – and the resulting quagmire turned out to be anything but.</p><p>The question of who will run Gaza, and whether what remains of Hamas will turn in their weapons, is very much up in the air.</p><p>The strip has largely been reduced to rubble. What the region needs, more than military guarantees, is money, from the wealthier Arab nations. </p><p>With 2 million Palestinians having been displaced or lost their homes, will the top priority be building housing? Or will it be putting up hotels, to attract tourists? It’s hard to imagine many people taking vacations there for years to come.</p><p>In urging Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, Trump said: "Cigars and Champagne, who the hell cares about that?"</p><p>The prime minister has delayed the trial through stalling tactics and diplomatic moves related to the war. He says the whole thing is a left-wing plot against his right-wing government, if that sounds familiar.</p><p>Israeli prosecutors say he exchanged regulatory favors with media big-shots for positive coverage, and 140 witnesses, including former aides, have testified against him.</p><p>In one case, Bibi and his wife Sara are charged with accepting $260,000 worth of luxury goods, including the cigars, bubbly and jewelry, for political favors.</p><p>In urging Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, Israelis were stunned, and said it could never happen because if such a pardon did magically materialize, it would require an admission of guilt by the prime minister. </p><p>Look, the 47th president says and does plenty of things that are strange, self-serving, hyperpartisan, infuriating or factually challenged.</p><p>Here’s an example from Truth Social:</p><p>"THE BIDEN FBI PLACED 274 AGENTS INTO THE CROWD ON JANUARY 6. If this is so, which it is, a lot of very good people will be owed big apologies. What a SCAM - DOSOMETHING!!! President DJT."</p><p>The problem? Therewas no Biden FBI on Jan. 6, 2021–Trump was still president! Hard to see how he could make that mistake.</p><p>Still, Trump is talking about a "golden age for Israel and the Middle East," which is a great goal. No other president could have pulled this off, and he richly deserves the praise. But the larger goal, a long-term peace in the volatile region, for the moment, remains a dream. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Jake Moody kicks game-winning field goal in first appearance with Bears</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A wet and wild Monday night game between the Chicago Bears and Washington Commanders turned into a thriller between two of the NFL’s oldest franchises.</p><p>Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels fumbled a handoff late in the fourth quarter and allowed the Bears’ defense to recover. Caleb Williams and D’Andre Swift led the offense down the field to set up a Jake Moody field goal attempt. It was Moody’s first day on the roster as the team signed him to replace an injured Cairo Santos.</p><p>Moody, with three seconds left and a steady mist coming down, nailed a 38-yard field goal to give the Bears the 25-24 win. Chicago improved to 3-2 with the win and the Commanders fell to 3-3.</p><p>The Bears jumped out to an early 13-0 lead in the first half. Moody was seemingly in good form. He nailed two field goals and Caleb Williams ran for a touchdown to start the second quarter.</p><p>The Commanders cut into the Bears’ lead when Daniels threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to Chris Moore. Washington got more points on the board after an eight-play, 25-yard drive in the third quarter, which ended with a Matt Gay field goal.</p><p>After Moody hit his third field goal of the night, the Bears’ offense went quiet.</p><p>Daniels led back-to-back scoring drives at the end of the third quarter and to start the fourth. He found Luke McCaffrey for a 33-yard touchdown pass and then fired a 6-yard touchdown to Zach Ertz.</p><p>Williams and the Bears didn’t stay down too long. The second-year quarterback hit Swift on a short pass. Swift made a few Commanders defenders miss and scampered for a 55-yard touchdown. Chicago missed out on a 2-point conversion and was down two points.</p><p>Moody was on point with his field-goal tries, despite one getting blocked.</p><p>He was cut by the San Francisco 49ers only a few weeks into the 2025 season, despite having a place in the record books during Super Bowl LVIII.</p><p>Moody turned around and etched his name into the Bears’ record books, making the most field goals in a Bears debut with four, according to ESPN.</p><p>"It’s always good to have a fresh start. I always believed in myself, believed in my teammates. Shoutout to (long snapper Scott Daly) and (holder Tory Taylor). They made the operation really easy on me. The same with the (offensive) line up front, protecting great on that last one. You can’t draw it up any better," he told ESPN’s Lisa Salters.</p><p>Williams was 17-of-29 with 252 passing yards and a touchdown pass. He completed passes to eight different receivers. Swift led the team with two catches for 67 yards. Luther Burden III had four catches for 51 yards.</p><p>Swift had 14 carries for 108 yards as well.</p><p>Daniels finished 19-of-26 with 211 passing yards, three touchdown passes and an interception. The Bears’ defense had three takeaways.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Falcons stun Bills behind brilliant offensive performances from Bijan Robinson and Drake London</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Atlanta Falcons used their bye week to find the right answers for the Buffalo Bills, who they beat 24-14 on "Monday Night Football."</p><p>The Falcons improved to 3-2 on the season, while the Bills have now lost two straight after starting the season 4-0. </p><p>While there were explosive offensive plays that contributed to this Falcons victory, their defense being able to handle Bills quarterback Josh Allen was just as important at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Monday night. Allen was sacked four times, the most by any team this season, as the Falcons didn’t just get pressure in the backfield, but made sure he couldn’t escape for big rushing yards. </p><p>However, the highlight reel is surely going to have the Falcons’ offensive stars, running back Bijan Robinson and wide receiver Drake London, leading the way after their generous contributions to that side of the ball. </p><p>Robinson rushed for 170 yards on 19 carries with an 81-yard touchdown that blew this game wide open in favor of the home team. The play came right after Allen was sacked for a 15-yard loss on third down, forcing a punt by the Bills. Robinson wasted no time, finding a hole at the line of scrimmage and bouncing out to the right where safety Cole Bishop couldn’t get him out of bounds, and it was off to the races. </p><p>But before Robinson’s magic, London showcased his strength when he caught a nine-yard pass from Penix near the goal line and reached his long arms across with the ball for six points, all while being tackled. That gave the Falcons the lead back, which they originally had thanks to Tyler Allgeier’s first carry of the game going for a 21-yard touchdown on the opening drive. </p><p>Allen was able to also find Dawson Knox for an opening-drive touchdown, but they had to punt four straight times before he threw an interception near the end of the first half. It was an uncharacteristic performance for the Bills’ offense, but their defense made adjustments in the second half to keep them in the game. </p><p>Allen and the Bills started the third quarter with the touchdown drive they needed, as Ray Davis caught a short pass from his quarterback and took it 16 yards for the score. But once again, the Bills’ offense stalled as the Falcons continued to come up with stops. </p><p>With a 21-14 lead in the fourth quarter, Michael Penix Jr. and his offense were looking to put a seal on their victory, and they did so with a drive that took up 5 minutes of clock and ended with a Parker Romo field goal to make it a two-possession game. </p><p>Allen tried for a miracle on the ensuing drive, but he was picked off after a deflected pass in the red zone as the Falcons celebrated their win. </p><p>In the box score, Penix was 20-of-32 for 250 yards with his touchdown pass to London, who led the game with 158 yards on 10 catches. Robinson also added 68 yards on six catches to total over 230 scrimmage yards in a brilliant game. </p><p>For the Bills, Allen was just 15-of-26 with two touchdowns and two interceptions. James Cook was kept relatively silent in this game with 87 yards on 17 carries. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Milwaukee Brewers turned one of the strangest double plays on Monday night in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p><p>Dodgers slugger Max Muncy was at the plate in the top of the fourth inning with the bases loaded and one out. He hit a long drive to center field. Brewers center fielder Sal Frelick tracked the ball down, but it went off his glove and hit the wall.</p><p>Frelick recovered and fired the ball to the infield, and the defense was able to get Teoscar Hernandez with the force out. Will Smith misjudged the ball and never ran to third base, allowing catcher William Contreras to jog to third base and get the final out of the inning.</p><p>Frelick was astonished. The Dodgers failed to pick up any runs in that inning.</p><p>However, the offense was still limited for the Brewers. Milwaukee went down in order in the bottom of the fourth and fifth innings.</p><p>Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman hit a home run in the top of the sixth to put Los Angeles up one run.</p><p>Los Angeles ended up with a 2-1 win and took a 1-0 series lead.</p><p>The Dodgers are looking to defend their World Series championship, which they won over the New York Yankees in 2024.</p><p>The Brewers are back in the NLCS for the first time since 2018. Milwaukee lost to the Dodgers in seven games. The Brewers haven’t made an appearance in the World Series since 1982. They have no rings as an organization.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>"Late Show" host Stephen Colbert played a murdered talk show host in the quirky detective series "Elsbeth."</p><p>Colbert announced to his audience in July that CBS is cancelling his show in spring 2026. The show’s cancellation follows the network and its parent company’s settlement with President Donald Trump over the summer after he sued both for "election interference" over a "60 Minutes" interview edit of his 2024 opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><p>But the talk show host is generating new headlines this week for appearing in "Elsbeth's" Season 3 premiere. Colbert portrayed the eponymous late night talk show host of "Way Late with Scotty Bristol," who is murdered by his executive producer.</p><p>According to IMDb, "Elsbeth" focuses on an "Astute but unconventional attorney Elsbeth Tascioni utilizes her singular point of view to make unique observations and corner brilliant criminals alongside the NYPD."</p><p>With recent controversies about late-night talk shows ranging from the cancellation of Colbert’s show to the brief suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" some, like culture writer Emma Fraser, wrote in the Daily Beast that one "might be under the impression that showrunner Jonathan Tolins is taking a ripped-from-the-headlines approach to the popular series."</p><p>However, the truth is more complicated, as showrunner Tolins reportedly wrote the episode before Colbert announced his show was being shut down. </p><p>"The first thing that he [Colbert] said to me was, ‘Wow, everybody’s gonna think that the Elsbeth writers have the biggest balls in Hollywood,’" Carrie Preston, who plays the titular character, told The Daily Beast.</p><p>But while Colbert plays a talk show host who is literally killed, the character he plays is one that does not appear to be based on himself.</p><p>"Scotty isn’t the kindest TV star or boss, which is why his executive producer, Laurel (Amy Sedaris), turns a paper shredder into a murder weapon," Fraser wrote.</p><p>"Although they have the same job, Scotty Bristol is not the loving, accepting, wonderful, and welcoming person that Stephen Colbert is," Preston said.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Keira Knightley 'very sorry' she didn't know about JK Rowling boycott before joining 'Potter' audio cast</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Actress Keira Knightley said she was "not aware" of fan calls to boycott the new "Harry Potter" Full Cast audiobooks and said she was "very sorry."</p><p>"I was not aware of that, no. I’m very sorry," Knightley told Decider when asked about the calls to boycott Rowling.</p><p>Some "Harry Potter" fans were calling for the new audiobooks to be boycotted due to author J.K. Rowling’s views on transgender issues. Rowling has been an outspoken critic of transgender ideology and an advocate for women who she says have been harmed as a result. Rowling’s stance has made her the target of fierce criticism, and has caused a rift between her and the cast of the "Harry Potter" films.</p><p>Emma Watson, who played Hermione Granger in the film franchise, made a veiled criticism of Rowling in 2020 after the author began speaking out against transgender ideology. Rowling criticized a news article that referred to women as "people who menstruate," in a post that went viral on X, formerly Twitter.</p><p>"I want my trans followers to know that I and so many other people around the world see you, respect you and love you for who you are," Watson had posted, seemingly in response to Rowling, at the time. </p><p>In a September podcast appearance, Watson said she still "treasure[s]" Rowling despite their differing views on transgender issues.</p><p>"I really don’t believe that by having had that experience and holding the love and support and views that I have, mean that I can’t and don’t treasure Jo [Rowling], and the person that I had personal experiences with, I will never believe that one negates the other and that my experiences of that person, I don’t get to keep and cherish. I just don’t think these things are either-or," Watson said on the "On Purpose" podcast.  </p><p>Rowling responded on X, making it clear she was in no mood to reconcile. She shot down an X user’s contention that they were confident she would one day forgive Watson and Daniel Radcliffe, who played the titular role and has also been critical of Rowling’s views on transgenderism.</p><p>"Celebs who cozied up to a movement intent on eroding women’s hard-won rights and who used their platforms to cheer on the transitioning of minors can save their apologies for traumatized detransitioners and vulnerable women reliant on single-sex spaces," Rowling wrote. </p><p>The director of the first two "Harry Potter" films, Chris Columbus, also addressed Rowling in a September interview. He said that he wished he could direct a film adaptation of Rowling’s play "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" but that her differences with the cast made it "impossible."</p><p>"I haven’t spoken to Miss Rowling in a decade or so, so I have no idea what’s going on with her, but I keep very close contact with Daniel Radcliffe and I just spoke to him a few days ago. I still have a great relationship with all the kids in the cast," Columbus told The Times of London.</p><p>Knightley, who will voice Professor Umbridge in the audiobooks, went on to express her hope that "we can all find respect." She did not give any indication that she would be participating in the boycott. </p><p>"You know, I think we’re all living in a period of time right now where we’re all going to have to figure out how to live together, aren’t we? And we’ve all got very different opinions. I hope that we can all find respect," Knightley said. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Kylie Jenner's promo for her new King Kylie Cosmetics collection has fans divided, with critics describing it as "deeply out of touch."</p><p>On Sunday, the 28-year-old reality star posted a short clip on Instagram in which she was seen handcuffed as she strutted down a jail hallway while flanked by two police officers. </p><p>Jenner donned a black leather bra and matching micro shorts that had hanging silver chains attached at the hips. She accessorized with black fishnet tights and chunky silver jewelry along with a pair of black slingback pumps. </p><p>The makeup mogul wore her long dark hair down in loose curls with teal streaks — a nod to the daring colors that she sported during her "King Kylie" era. </p><p>The video concluded as the screen cut to black and a woman was heard whispering "King Kylie" while the words "King Kylie. Tomorrow" flashed across the screen.</p><p>Jenner's new makeup collection is a callback to the rebellious "King Kylie" persona that she popularized during the mid 2010s that helped launch her early brand identity. At the time, Jenner became known for her edgy, experimental looks, especially after dyeing her hair blue. </p><p>The time period coincided with the 2015 launch of her makeup brand, Kylie Cosmetics, which she built into a beauty empire. </p><p>After Jenner shared the teaser, fans and some of her famous friends flocked to the comments section of her post to express their excitement over her new collection. </p><p>"exactly," Hailey Bieber wrote while Lauren Sánchez Bezos added a raised hands emoji. One fan wrote, "KING KYLIE IS BACK," with another writing: "We're back."</p><p>However, online critics vented their fury in a thread on Reddit, slamming the model for the imagery she used amid the ongoing ICE raids and renewed debate over policing and immigration enforcement.</p><p>"The country’s boiling over, citizens being dragged off by rogue badge hungry rent-a-cops, and Kylie Jenner drops a handcuffed hot-pants photoshoot to promote COSMETICS. This isn’t satire; it’s American rot," wrote one Reddit user alongside a screengrab from the promo. </p><p>"She is out of touch," another agreed. </p><p>"lol as if she could ever comprehend what the people she cosplays as are going thru," one critic added. "this is insanely disgusting, and i didnt even think about how <i>deeply</i> out of touch this was til i read your title for this post. you’re so right."</p><p>Other Reddit users criticized Jenner for reviving her "King Kylie" branding, noting it followed the recent "No Kings" protests against perceived authoritarianism under the Trump administration. </p><p>"To add to this, does anyone else find it odd that there have been ‘No Kings’ protests around the country, and she drops a shoot called ‘King Kylie’ with the associated imagery mentioned by OP [original poster]?" one commenter wrote. </p><p>Some critics compared the promo to other controversial celebrity marketing campaigns, including Jenner's sister Kendall Jenner’s 2017 Pepsi ad. </p><p>In the commercial, Jenner was seen leaving a fashion photoshoot to join a protest, where she ends tension between demonstrators and police by handing an officer a can of Pepsi. </p><p>Fans quickly slammed the ad as tone-deaf and exploitative. Within 48 hours, Pepsi pulled the campaign and apologized, admitting it had "missed the mark." </p><p>Jenner later tearfully addressed the incident on an episode of "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," saying she felt "so f----- stupid."</p><p>"Is she actually trying to recreate the same controversy Kendall went through with the tone-deaf Pespi [sic] ad???" one Reddit user wrote of Jenner. </p><p>"the outrage over this should compare kendall’s pepsi campaign…. like it’s that all over again…." another agreed. </p><p>Jenner has not spoken out about the controversy.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Jenner's representative for comment. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Ellen Greenberg’s controversial death ruled suicide again, new report ‘deeply flawed’ says lawyer</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Ellen Greenberg’s death has once again been ruled a suicide, following a new review by the Philadelphia Medical Examiner’s Office, according to media reports.</p><p>Per People, the report reaffirms that Greenberg, a 27-year-old Philadelphia schoolteacher, died by suicide despite sustaining 20 stab wounds to her back, neck, and head, with a knife found protruding from her chest.</p><p>Greenberg, who taught first grade at Juniata Park Academy, was found dead in her locked apartment on January 26, 2011, after returning home early from work due because of a snowstorm. </p><p>Her fiancé, Samuel Goldberg, said he discovered her body after forcing open the door when she didn’t respond. Goldberg was never a suspect and was never charged with any crime.</p><p>The circumstances, including multiple stab wounds and no signs of forced entry, have fueled years of debate and legal challenges from her family over whether her death was self-inflicted.</p><p>The new ruling sparked backlash, with the Greenberg family attorney Joseph Podraza Jr. saying in a statement that the review was "a deeply flawed attempt to justify a predetermined conclusion."</p><p>"It includes false claims like the assertion that a stab wound in Ellen’s spinal column was made during the autopsy, a theory rejected by every credible expert, including the City’s own neuropathologist," Podraza said in a statement.</p><p>"By ignoring key evidence that contradicts suicide, the extensive 3D photogrammetry, a recreation which proves Ellen could not self-inflict all the wounds, unexplained bruises, missing surveillance footage, an intact lock, accounts of a toxic relationship," he said.</p><p>Greenberg’s death was initially ruled a homicide in 2011, before Assistant Medical Examiner Dr. Marlon Osbourne changed the manner of death to suicide after meeting with Philadelphia Police investigators.</p><p>Chief Medical Examiner Lindsay Simon led the most recent review as part of a settlement with Greenberg’s parents, who have spent years contesting the suicide finding.</p><p>In February, Greenberg's family settled lawsuits with the City of Philadelphia and others, asking them to reevaluate Ellen's manner of death. The family said it should be changed to homicide or undetermined.</p><p>Per People, the new report said that "while the distribution of injuries is admittedly unusual, the fact remains that Ellen would be capable of inflicting these injuries herself," noting she was a "young woman suffering from anxiety."</p><p>The chief medical examiner wrote that "the fiancé’s DNA was not detected on the knife used to inflict the injuries" and that there was no evidence of an abusive relationship or a struggle at the scene. </p><p>"With all of this information considered, it is the opinion of the undersigned that the manner of Ellen Greenberg’s death is best classified as ‘suicide,'" the report said.</p><p>In his statement, Podraza said Simon's report was "an embarrassment to the City, and an insult to Ellen and her family."</p><p>"Ellen’s family just wanted the truth. It is clear the truth will not come from Philadelphia’s law enforcement machinery. Though Ellen’s city turned its back on her, we will continue through other avenues to get justice for her murder, by any means necessary," he said.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the Philadelphia Medical Examiner’s Office and the City of Philadelphia Law Department for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The NFL announced that Detroit Lions safety Brian Branch was suspended one game without pay for his fight with Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Juju Smith-Schuster on Sunday night.</p><p>"Your aggressive, non-football act was entirely unwarranted, posed a serious risk of injury, and clearly violated the standards of conduct and sportsmanship expected of NFL players," Jon Runyan, the NFL vice president of football operations, wrote in a letter to Branch, per ESPN. "Your conduct reflected poorly on the NFL and has no place in our game."</p><p>Branch will reportedly appeal his suspension, according to NFL Network. </p><p>Branch is currently set to miss the team’s Monday night game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 7. </p><p>The incident occurred after the Lions fell to the Chiefs, 30-17, on Sunday night. Patrick Mahomes was seen trying to high-five Branch, but the latter completely ignored him and went up to Smith-Schuster. They exchanged a few words, and Branch proceeded to slap Smith-Schuster across the helmet. </p><p>Smith-Schuster went to the ground, but would quickly get back on his feet and charge at Branch. Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco tried to get in between them to break up the altercation, but Branch ripped off Smith-Schuster’s helmet as players from both teams started to get involved in the scrum. </p><p>After players and coaches finally got the situation under control, Branch regretted his decision to start the bout. </p><p>"It was a childish thing, but I'm tired of people doing stuff in between the play and refs don't catch it," Branch said. "They be trying to bully me out there. I should have never did it. It was childish."</p><p>Lions head coach Dan Campbell also condemned Branch’s actions after the game. </p><p>"I love Brian Branch, but what he did is inexcusable, and it's not going to be accepted here. It's not what we do. It's not what we're about," Campbell said. "I apologized to coach (Andy) Reid and the Chiefs, and Smith-Schuster. </p><p>"That's not OK. That's not what we do here. It's not going to be OK. He knows it. Our team knows it. That's not what we do."</p><p>Branch has already been fined this season for an unsportsmanlike situation. He was docked $23,186 for facemask and unsportsmanlike penalties against the Green Bay Packers in September. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche criticized the New York Times for an article on Monday claiming that Blanche had "disdain" for Patel.</p><p>The article, titled "Part Enabler, Part Buffer: The Bind of the Justice Dept.’s No. 2," centered on Blanche allegedly clashing with other members of the Trump administration in terms of agenda, including Attorney General Pam Bondi. </p><p>Reporters Glenn Thrush and Alan Feuer claimed that both Bondi and Blanche, however, were united in their dislike for Patel.</p><p>"They bonded, in particular, over their mutual disdain for the FBI director, Kash Patel, whom they view as a lightweight more interested in social media than doing his job, according to seven current and former administration officials," they wrote. "Mr. Patel is supposed to report to Mr. Blanche. In reality, Mr. Blanche and Ms. Bondi sometimes have trouble getting him on the same page with them, those people said."</p><p>Both Blanche and Patel pushed back on their X accounts, attacking the publication as "failing" and "trash."</p><p>"Hey @FBIDirectorKash- the failing New York Times says we don’t like each other. Guess we’ll have to stop hanging out after work? Those dummies. Virtually every part of their ‘reporting’ is exaggerated or fabricated, per usual. If it wasn’t for Wordle, nobody would subscribe," Blanche wrote.</p><p>Patel responded, "NYTrash- the journalistic equivalent of crash test dummies."</p><p>In a comment to Fox News Digital, a New York Times spokesperson said, "The Times's article is based on conversations with seven current and former administration officials with direct knowledge of the working relationships inside the Justice Department. We are confident in our reporting."</p><p>Patel and Blanche were recently interviewed last week by Fox News Digital at the FBI’s Chicago Field Office regarding President Donald Trump’s crackdown on crime and illegal immigration through "Operation Midway Blitz." </p><p>During the interview, Patel dismissed reports from mainstream media claiming that former FBI Director James Comey would be arrested and paraded in a "perp walk" display.</p><p>"The mainstream media wants to take the eye off the ball and create theater," Patel said. "We're not about theater. We're about producing our results in court. And that's what you're going to see tomorrow start, the revelation of details, and it will be forthcoming in the judicial process as everyone in America is entitled to, including Mr. Comey, and we want him to have his day in court, and it starts tomorrow."</p></body></div></body></html>

The Browns, Steelers and Bengals each play in the AFC North.</p><p>Tomlin and the Steelers dominated the Browns in Week 6 and now play the Bengals on Thursday night to start Week 7.</p><p>"To be honest, it was shocking to me," Tomlin said of the trade, via Pro Football Talk. "Andrew Berry must be a lot smarter than me or us, because it doesn’t make sense to me to trade a quarterback that you think enough of to make your opening starter to a divisional opponent that’s hurting in that area. But that’s just my personal feeling."</p><p>Tomlin went on to praise Flacco’s savviness as he gets more ingrained into the Bengals’ offense.</p><p>Flacco led the Browns to a victory over the Green Bay Packers on Sept. 21. His performance in that game gave fans and experts the expectation that he would help the Bengals on Sunday.</p><p>Flacco had 219 passing yards and two touchdown passes, but the Packers came out on top 27-18.</p><p>Pittsburgh topped Cleveland, 23-9, on Sunday.

<div class="article-title">Jeffries tells Lawler to 'keep your mouth shut' as shutdown sparks Capitol Hill confrontations</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The National Hockey League played seven games in its young 2025-2026 season by the end of the day last Wednesday. The contests featured a grand total of two fights. </p><p>The government shutdown had run for eight days by the end of the day on that Wednesday. And the now lengthy shutdown sparked two extraordinary verbal brawls in the halls of Congress between lawmakers.</p><p>NHL referees Gord Dwyer and Mitch Dunning worked the Washington Capitals/Boston Bruins tilt Wednesday night in DC. Perhaps the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms could have summoned Dwyer and Dunning up to Capitol Hill to dole out a few ten-minute misconducts beforehand.</p><p>"You're embarrassing yourself right now!" hollered House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., at Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y.</p><p>"The only embarrassment here is you!" thundered Lawler at Jeffries.</p><p>Tempers exploded as Lawler lay in wait outside the House Radio/TV Gallery Studio for a shutdown smackdown after Jeffries concluded his now-daily press conference. </p><p>"You're not going to talk to me and talk over me when you don't want to hear what I'm going to say!" yelled an animated Jeffries at Lawler, jabbing his index finger toward his colleague's chest but never poking him. </p><p>"Oh, I'm listening," said Lawler.</p><p>"So just keep your mouth shut!" shouted the usually cool Jeffries. </p><p>There were multiple rounds of vocal fisticuffs between Members and Congressional leaders.</p><p>Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., summoned the press to the hallway outside the office of House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to complain about the shutdown and criticize the Speaker for not swearing-in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., more than two weeks after her election. Johnson then confronted the Arizona senators. And Lawler was nearby, serving as "fourth man in."</p><p>"This is absurd," seethed an exasperated Johnson.</p><p>"This is the longest the House has gone…" interrupted Gallego.</p><p>"Do you want me to answer the question?" shot back Johnson.</p><p>"You’re not actually answering the question," countered Gallego.</p><p>The multiple rounds of brawls in the halls between lawmakers were nearly unprecedented in Congress. The shutdown smackdowns featured arguments about health care. Lawler waved around legislation focused on the Democrats’ push during the shutdown: a package to extend Obamacare subsidies.</p><p>"If you believe in it so much!" chided Lawler, with a rhetorical uppercut. </p><p>"Bro, do you understand math?" counterpunched Jeffries.</p><p>Tensions are spiking at the Capitol. Yours truly asked Johnson about Lawler confronting Jeffries and his decision to step out of the Speaker’s Office to engage Kelly and Gallego. I noted to the Speaker that if the House was in session, there may be fistfights in the hallways.</p><p>"Are you concerned and is it incumbent upon you as the Speaker to try to lower this temperature?" I asked.</p><p>Johnson added that the contretemps "concerns me." He added that he wanted to "restore civility to the institution."</p><p>"Let's have policy disputes. But not make it personal. This gets personal. Emotions are high. People are upset. I'm upset. I'm a very patient man. But I am very angry right now because this is dangerous stuff. And so is it better for them to be physically separated right now? It probably is." said Johnson. </p><p>Lawmakers aren’t the only ones raging. Thousands of federal workers are fuming at the shutdown. The administration is now firing federal workers. </p><p>"Right now, many families are paying the price for political gridlock that they didn't cause," said American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley.</p><p>Rep. Sarah Elfreth, D-Md., represents 44,000 federal employees in her district near Washington, DC. She notes that Maryland has lost 15,000 federal jobs since President Trump took office in January. </p><p>"I believe that (the firings) are not only unethical and immoral, but illegal for him to be RIF-ing people during a shutdown. There's no new authority granted to the President or OMB during a shutdown," said Elfreth. "I don't believe in negotiating by threat. It also shows that I think they have the weaker hand and that they're losing the PR battle nationally to resort to threats."</p><p>While the shutdown is the main event, the undercard is a fight between Democrats and Johnson over Grijalva to succeed her late father, Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz. The elder Grijalva died in March after a battle with cancer.</p><p>"I can't hire staff. We don't have an office," said Grijalva "So it's very much second-class citizen feeling for me."</p><p>Democrats have tried on multiple occasions to compel the House to swear-in Grijalva during brief, pro forma sessions where the body gavels in and gavels out after just a few seconds. Once in office, Grijalva would provide the crucial 218th signature to go over the head of the Speaker and force the House to vote on a measure to release the Epstein files.</p><p>"Get your people in and stop covering up for the pedophiles<i>,</i>" shouted Gallego at Johnson during their confrontation in the corridor.</p><p>"That’s ridiculous," responded Johnson. </p><p>"There's nobody covering up for pedophiles," chirped Lawler from the back of the scrum. "So knock it the hell off."</p><p>Johnson denies the Grijalva holdup is about the Epstein files. </p><p>"We'll schedule it, I guess, as soon as she wants. It has nothing to do with it," said Johnson. </p><p>But Grijalva wrote to the Speaker last week demanding the House swear her in immediately. And the House still hasn’t sworn her in.</p><p>Circumstances were different this spring when the House GOP majority dwindled to a net seat of one. Republicans needed as many votes as they could muster to pass parliamentary frameworks for the Big, Beautiful Bill. Johnson swore-in Reps. Randy Fine, R-Fla., and Jimmy Patronis, R-Fla., a day after they won special elections.</p><p>"These guys worked hard and they earned the position," said Johnson when he met with them back in April. "These gentlemen are going to come in and help us deliver the America First agenda." </p><p>Johnson noted that swearing-in Fine and Patronis made "the margin a little more comfortable" for House Republicans.</p><p>So Johnson is keeping the House out of session for now. House Democrats are returning to Capitol Hill this week to make a point of Johnson keeping the House out of session during the shutdown. Regardless, pouring everyone back into the Capitol would likely trigger the Congressional equivalent of a line brawl. </p><p>There are unwritten rules about hockey fights. You don’t sucker punch someone. You don’t knee your opponent. You generally square off in a fight with someone in your same weight class. In hockey, both sides warm up on their own side of the red line before the game and between periods. Violation of that code might trigger a big brawl.</p><p>Lawmakers from both sides seemingly left their own side of the rink to pick fights with the other side. Gallego and Kelly outside the Speaker’s Office. Lawler outside Jeffries’ news conference.</p><p>But lawmakers are apparently ignoring these unwritten rules. The government shutdown soon enters its third week and everyone is dropping their gloves.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Penn State athletic director explains decision to fire head coach James Franklin: 'I felt it was time'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Penn State Nittany Lions athletic director Pat Kraft made the decision to fire head football coach James Franklin, and he told reporters on Monday that it wasn’t just the three-game losing streak that led to the decision.</p><p>Franklin’s departure is a shock to college football, as the leader in the locker room since 2014 parts ways with the Nittany Lions, who will have a whopping $50 million buyout to pay him. </p><p>Kraft said he was "looking at everything" after Penn State’s loss to Northwestern, 22-21, on Saturday. </p><p>"I felt after sitting down Saturday and looking at everything, at where we were in terms of the best interest of the athletes and where the program was going that we had to make the hard decision," Kraft told reporters, via Sports Illustrated. "Looking at where the program was, where it is, and where we want to be, I felt that there was no other course. I felt it was time."</p><p>This is a Penn State program that was ranked No. 2 in the country before the season started. They went 3-0 to begin, but have been in a free fall since. It came to a head against an unranked Northwestern team, as fans’ chants to fire Franklin roared even louder than they were when Oregon went into Beaver Stadium and handed them their first loss. </p><p>Kraft and Franklin have had a longstanding friendship as well as a professional relationship, making his firing hard on many levels. </p><p>"James Franklin is a good friend who has always carried himself with dignity, and represented Penn State with absolute class," Kraft explained. "We are all fortunate to have had James Franklin to lead this program for more than a decade and we wish nothing but the best for him and his family."</p><p>The Nittany Lions will be led by Terry Smith, Franklin’s assistant coach, who has been named the interim head coach. </p><p>Franklin took over as Penn State’s head coach before the 2014 season after leading Vanderbilt for three seasons in the same role. He was in his 12th season at Penn State, having brought the team to the College Football Playoff semifinals last season. </p><p>As the team’s head coach, Franklin was 104-45. </p><p>Looking ahead, Penn State will be without quarterback Drew Allar for the remainder of the season due to a leg injury suffered in the loss to Northwestern. They will head into a matchup with Iowa next week, but the schedule gets much harder from there. </p><p>Penn State will see No. 1 Ohio State on Nov. 1, No. 7 Indiana on Nov. 8, and four or more losses would keep them out of the College Football Playoff for this season. </p><p><i>Fox News’ Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.</i></p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Israeli-American actress Natalie Portman expressed excitement Monday over the prospect of peace between Israel and Gaza.</p><p>While at the Lumière Film Festival in Lyon, France, Portman remarked that it was a "momentous day" as the two-year war between Israel and Hamas appeared to be ending, and the remaining living hostages were being released from Gaza. </p><p>"To see the end of the war today and the release and the swap of the prisoners and the hostages is really a momentous day," the "Star Wars" actress said.</p><p>Former President Donald Trump recently brokered a peace deal between Israel and Hamas that went into effect this week.</p><p>The prisoner exchange began Monday, with Hamas releasing the final 20 living hostages in exchange for Israel freeing about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, according to the Associated Press and Reuters. The swap is part of Trump’s 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the conflict and rebuilding Gaza. So far, only four of the 28 presumed-dead hostages have been recovered.</p><p>Portman attended the festival as a guest of honor, with the Lumière Film Festival recognizing her Hollywood career. During a Q&amp;A and a screening of her 2010 film "Black Swan," festival director Thierry Frémaux asked where she was from, prompting her to reflect on events in Israel. </p><p>"Well, I’m from Jerusalem, I am born in Jerusalem," Portman said. "So today is a very, very emotional day."</p><p>After calling it a "momentous day," the actress added, "It feels almost crazy to be talking about anything else except celebrating — hopefully — peace."</p><p>Portman previously expressed sorrow for Israel following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attacks, writing that her "heart was shattered for the people of Israel."</p><p>"Children, women and the elderly have been murdered and abducted from their own homes," Portman wrote.

<div class="article-title">DR. MARC SIEGEL: From Horror to Hope: What Gaza's freed hostages teach a weary world</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Any person who can survive captivity under extreme conditions is a hero in anyone’s book. Yes, there are variations in the degree of starvation, torture, mental anguish and deprivation; the degree of exposure to respiratory and gastrointestinal infections; not to mention the compounded torment for those who have been injured, beaten or shot, and for those with underlying medical conditions that aren’t being treated. But what all the 20 living hostages released from captivity in Gaza on Monday, Oct. 13, have in common is courage, hope and life. That is not to say they aren't suffering or won’t continue to suffer. Still, they can hold fast to the belief that they have been chosen by God to survive.</p><p>Twin brothers — the 28-year-old Bermans — were seen smiling and hugging when they arrived at Sheba Medical Center outside Tel Aviv, on Monday at one of the top medical centers in the world. But what unimaginable suffering was taking place beneath those smiles? How long will it take to treat the flashbacks, nightmares, extreme anxiety and episodes of depersonalization they will surely experience? What are the long-term effects of being dehumanized for prolonged periods while living in absolute terror?</p><p>Unfortunately, these questions are not new. President Donald Trump’s words in Israel this week, delivered before the Knesset — "Never again" and "Never forget" — refer not to Hamas but to the Holocaust, when millions of Jews and non-Jews were exterminated in Auschwitz and other camps.</p><p>Barely surviving under those circumstances often involved prayer. It brings to mind a scene from my new book, "The Miracles Among Us." Praying directly to God can affect the outcome, but God grants us the miracles He wants to give, not necessarily those we ask Him for.</p><p>In 1944, Isaac Mittelman was interned in a labor camp in Hungary when he was discovered praying on Yom Kippur. He was strung up on a tree and left to freeze. Somehow he managed, barely, to survive the night. Doctors later placed him in a hospital and simply watched as his frostbitten arm became increasingly necrotic. Eventually, the cruel hospital doctors amputated it with only a towel between Isaac’s teeth for anesthesia. </p><p>Still, Isaac managed to survive, and weeks later he was again praying to God — reciting the Shema ("Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one") — when bombs hit the hospital where he was recovering, killing everyone but Isaac. He escaped wearing a Hungarian soldier’s uniform, and in Budapest was mistaken for a soldier because he spoke fluent Hungarian. When the Allies liberated the city, they nearly shot Isaac on sight but stopped when they heard him speaking Yiddish.</p><p>Why did God save him? Isaac later told his son Barry he believed it was so that he could go on to become a great rabbi and kosher butcher (mashgiach) later in life.</p><p>Why did God save Dr. Ellay Hogeg Golan, her 18-month-old baby and her husband after Hamas set fire to their home on their kibbutz on Oct. 7, 2023? Many months later — after the baby survived, thanks to her mother’s breast milk, and Ellay herself survived a month-long coma at Sheba Medical Center, overcoming severe burns, blood clots and multiple infections including COVID — it became clear that God’s purpose was to have Ellay return to her work as a critical care anesthesiologist, where she could save others using the same ventilators that once kept her alive.</p><p>I tell this story in my forthcoming book, "The Miracles Among Us," though it practically tells itself. Ellay and her husband, Ariel, told me they don’t consider their family’s survival a miracle because that would dishonor those who weren’t chosen to survive.</p><p>The return of 20 hostages to Israel on Monday — thanks to the efforts of President Trump, Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner and others—was a miraculous event.</p><p>In October 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu quoted Ecclesiastes, saying there is "a time for war." Again, this week, Netanyahu referred to the Bible's book of Ecclesiastes and to the teachings of wise King Solomon, who said the path to righteousness and meaning involves fear of God and obedience to His commandments.</p><p>That remains the wisest path for Israel and the world now, with the hostages’ example of fortitude and resilience inspiring many of us forward.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday announced that he intends to nominate President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in securing a ceasefire and hostage agreement between Hamas and Israel.</p><p>It will be Pakistan's second time putting up Trump for the prize. In June, Pakistan nominated Trump for his role in securing a ceasefire agreement between Islamabad and neighboring India.</p><p>"Pakistan had nominated President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding, extraordinary contributions to first stop the war between India and Pakistan and then achieve a ceasefire, along with his very wonderful team," Sharif said in Egypt, speaking next to Trump.</p><p>"And today, again, I would like to nominate this great president for the Nobel Peace Prize because I genuinely feel that he is the most genuine and most wonderful candidate for the Peace Prize because he has brought not only peace in South Asia, saving millions of people and their lives," he added. "And today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieving peace in Gaza is saving millions of lives in the Middle East."</p><p>Trump and Sharif were part of a delegation of world leaders gathered in Egypt’s coastal resort area of Sharm el-Sheikh to sign documents related to the peace deal in Gaza.</p><p>After announcing his intention to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, Sharif turned to the president and made a brief saluting gesture toward him.</p><p>"Mr. President, I would like to salute you for your exemplary, visionary leadership. I think you are the man this world needs most at this point in time. The world will always remember you as a man who did everything — who went out of his way to stop seven and, today, eight wars," Sharif added.</p><p>Last week, the Nobel Committee in Norway awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado.</p><p>While introducing the other world leaders, Trump appeared to chide Norway over last week’s choice.</p><p>"Oh, Norway — aye, yay, yay," Trump said.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Longevity is a lifestyle practice, according to 100-year-old Ruth Lemay, who has gone viral for sharing her vibrant energy and fitness routine.</p><p>Lemay, who lives in Virginia Beach, was featured in a video while pedaling on a recumbent exercise bike at the gym. The video was posted by the health brand evry.day club (@evrydayclub) on Instagram.</p><p>The centenarian was asked what she does to stay so fit and "look so great" for her age, as she was wrapping up three miles on the bike after 30 minutes.</p><p>"Then I’ll do 30 more minutes," she commented. "And I walk — [I’ll] do a mile."</p><p>Lemay shared her "secret to longevity" — the fact that she started walking four miles every day after she retired.</p><p>"That’s just what keeps you going," she said. "A lot of exercise. Plenty of sleep. I go to bed at 9:30 at night and I eat a lot of vegetables — trying to keep healthy."</p><p>Lemay said that she and her 78-year-old daughter attend the gym three times per week. They typically do individual workouts.</p><p>Her sessions include riding the recumbent bike, which is reclined to support the lower back, for two 30-minute stints, reaching about three miles both times.</p><p>That is followed by a 1.4-mile walk, as Lemay is currently working toward reaching a mile and a half.</p><p>"When I don't go to the recreation center, I still try and walk from one end of my house to the other," she told Women’s Health. "It's 170 steps, 40 times, which is 6,800 steps (3.22 miles)."</p><p>In an interview with TODAY.com, Lemay said she lives in her own home and enjoys cooking. She drove a car until she was 98.</p><p>"I've always exercised," she said. "I feel fine. I might be a little bit tired after riding the bicycle and the walk, but that's OK. I don't expect not to feel tired."</p><p>Her late husband of 56 years would encourage her to walk after work, said Lemay.</p><p>"He said, ‘You just take the dog and go for a walk, and I'll fix dinner,’" she recalled. "It was wonderful."</p><p>Lemay’s daughter, Annette Parker, shared with TODAY that her mother has "always been very conscious of her diet."</p><p>This includes non-fat yogurt, walnuts, oatmeal with banana and milk, or a scrambled egg with toast in the mornings. For protein, Lemay sticks with chicken, turkey or seafood.</p><p>Lemay’s diet also includes red grapes, blueberries and many vegetables.</p><p>"I love vegetables. I grew up in the country, and my dad grew all kinds of vegetables, and they were wonderful for you," she said.</p><p>Lemay, who has never smoked and doesn’t drink alcohol, added, "I’m in pretty good health for my age."</p><p>While genetics may impact longevity, Lemay shared with TODAY that she doesn't know anyone in her family who has lived as long as her. Her mother died of colon cancer at 65 and her father died from a heart condition at 74.</p><p>Other than one heart valve replacement, the great-grandmother has avoided major health complications.</p><p>In addition to paying attention to nutrition and fitness, Lemay and Parker said that maintaining good mental health and keeping a vibrant social life have been key longevity factors.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Lemay and her representatives for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Mamdani breaks silence on freed Israeli hostages in statement that doesn't mention Trump</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>After facing backlash for staying silent as Israeli hostages were freed from Gaza, New York City socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani finally broke his silence Monday afternoon.</p><p>"Today’s scenes of Israelis and Palestinians are profoundly moving: Israeli hostages being freed and families reunited after years of fear, uncertainty, and torture; the first days in Gaza without relentless Israeli bombardment of Palestinians as families return to rubble and loved ones freed from detention," Mamdani posted on X on Monday shortly after 4 p.m. EST in a message that did not mention President Donald Trump or acknowledge his role in the negotiations. </p><p>Mamdani went on to mark the development as a "glimmer of hope" that the ceasefire will "hold" and the "long and difficult work of reconstruction can begin."</p><p>"I also know this news brings solace to millions of New Yorkers, who’ve felt the pain of the past few years," Mamdani said. "We have watched as our tax dollars have funded a genocide. The moral and human cost will be a lasting stain and requires accountability and real examination of our collective conscience and our government’s policies."</p><p>Mamdani’s lengthy post concluded by saying that the "responsibility now lies" with those who "believe in peace."</p><p>"Once aid is delivered, the wounded are cared for, and a lasting agreement secured, we cannot look away," Mamdani said. "We must work towards a future built upon justice, one without occupation and apartheid, and for a world where every person can live with safety and dignity."</p><p>Mamdani’s post came roughly three hours after one of his opponents, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, called him out on social media for not commenting that morning as the hostages were released. </p><p>"It shouldn’t go unnoticed that @ZohrankMamdani — who still refuses to condemn the phrase ‘globalize the intifada’ (widely understood to mean death to Jews) — has yet to comment on the release of the hostages," Cuomo posted on X. "His silence speaks volumes."</p><p>Both Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa released statements on social media earlier in the morning praising the release of the hostages, with Sliwa being the only one to offer praise to Trump by name. </p><p>In a CNN interview on Friday, Mamdani hinted that he was open to giving Trump credit. </p><p>"If the genocide ends, then I think that’s something worthy to be praised, and if the hostages are returned," Mamdani said. "Those things together have to be done in tandem."</p><p>Mamdani's post quickly brought critical reactions, including from New York City GOP Councilwoman Inna Vernikov.</p><p>"GLARINGLY MISSING FROM THIS WORD SALAD: Any single mention of HAMAS or the TERRORISTS who brought this upon themselves by murdering &amp; raping their way across Israel on 10/7," Vernikov posted on X. "You know, the same terrorists that your wife was glorifying on her Instagram story? Those terrorists?"</p><p>Mamdani, who has been widely criticized for his comments and positions on Israel, spent Sunday night raising money for a United Nations organization that employed Oct. 7 terrorists, just hours before the final living Israeli hostages were released from Hamas captivity.</p><p>Trump celebrated "peace in the Middle East" after he signed the historic peace agreement that ended two years of fighting in Gaza. </p><p>"At long last, we have peace in the Middle East, and it's a very simple expression, peace in the Middle East," Trump said during remarks at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, flanked by dozens of world leaders. </p><p>"We've heard it for many years, but nobody thought it could ever get there. And now we're there." </p><p>Trump went on: "This is the day that people across this region and around the world have been working, striving, hoping, and praying for. With the historic agreement we have just signed, those prayers of millions have finally been answered. Together, we have achieved the impossible."</p><p>His remarks came after Hamas released the final remaining 20 living hostages on Monday as Israel backed off its frontline positioning in Gaza over the weekend. </p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the Mamdani campaign but did not immediately receive a response.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Anders Hagstrom and Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Time magazine dedicated its next cover to President Donald Trump's "triumph" in the Middle East as the first phase of the peace agreement between Israel and Hamas that could have ripple effects across the globe. </p><p>On Monday, Time unveiled its next edition featuring Trump confidently looking onward with the title, "His Triumph."</p><p>"The living Israeli hostages held in Gaza have been freed under the first phase of Donald Trump's peace plan, alongside a Palestinian prisoner release," Time wrote on X. "The deal may become a signature achievement of Trump's second term, and it could mark a strategic turning point for the Middle East."</p><p>It marks a stark contrast to the numerous unflattering ones the magazine has done of Trump over the years, although it's also twice named him Person of the Year.</p><p>The article attached to the cover story highlighted Trump's mantra that the "art of the deal" could "solve anything."</p><p>"It was his creed in business, then in politics: the conviction that every conflict, no matter how intractable, can be negotiated into submission," Time told readers, discussing his use of envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in negotiations.</p><p>"The deal could become a signature achievement of Trump's second term—fulfilling his campaign vow to stop a war that has killed tens of thousands, while returning Israeli captives to their families and beginning the arduous work of rebuilding Gaza. It could also mark a strategic turning point for the Middle East," it continued, later adding, "If the peace holds, the region could enter a new era defined less by conflict than by the possibility of transformation, including the rebuilding of a post-Hamas Gaza and the normalization of Israeli relations with Saudi Arabia."  </p><p>The last 20 living Israeli hostages returned home early Monday after more than two years of captivity following the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack. Only four of the 28 bodies of Israeli hostages have been handed over so far, however. It is part of a larger swap that saw Israel free nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.</p><p>The early stages of Trump's peace deal have seen him earning rare praise in the media.</p><p>"Listen, whether you like Trump or not, I think he, I think Steve Witkoff, and I think Jared Kushner, do deserve credit for this deal," said "The View" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin on Monday. "They personally met with Hamas. I used to be of the mind we don’t negotiate with terrorists, but sometimes the only way to get peace is to sit down with some of the most evil people and try to come up with what we can do to end the bloodshed."</p><p>Trump heralded the deal as the dawn of a new era for the Middle East on Monday.</p><p>"It took us 3,000 years to get to this point," Trump said, saying the Gaza deal was only the first step toward wider peace.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Michael J. Fox is hoping his death isn't "dramatic" after battling Parkinson's disease for the past 35 years.</p><p>Fox opened up about his future with the "mysterious" disease, which he was first diagnosed with at age 29.</p><p>"There’s no timeline, there’s no series of stages that you go through — not in the same way that you would, say, with prostate cancer. It’s much more mysterious and enigmatic," the now 64-year-old actor told The Times.</p><p>"There are not many people who have had Parkinson’s for 35 years," Fox continued. "I’d like to just not wake up one day. That’d be really cool. I don’t want it to be dramatic. I don’t want to trip over furniture, smash my head."</p><p>Parkinson's disease, a degenerative brain disorder, affects the nervous system and mobility, according to the Mayo Clinic. Throughout his prolific acting career, Fox has had to find ways to work around his Parkinson's disease symptoms. A doctor once told him acting would help him cope with the symptoms of the disease, The Times reported.</p><p>"It was helpful, to a point," Fox explained. "And that’s [the point] where I break stuff. It’s absolutely incredible the stuff I broke. In a three-year period, I broke my elbow, I broke my hand, I got a big infection in my hand and I almost lost my finger."</p><p>At one point, the "Back to the Future" star lost the ability to play a guitar he now keeps beside his office desk.</p><p>"It’s terrible," he said. "I had all these little bones broken, and it got infected, and they had to cut the bones out because the bones got infected. I broke my other shoulder, had it replaced. I broke my cheekbone. I had a plate here. I’m missing something?"</p><p>"It has been just like a tragedy," he added.</p><p>"I take it easy now," Fox noted. "I don’t walk that much anymore. I can walk but it’s not pretty and it’s a bit dangerous. So I just roll that into my life, you know — no pun intended."</p><p>Fox first gained fame for his role in "Family Ties." The actor received three Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Alex P. Keaton in the sitcom. While filming "Family Ties," Fox landed the role of Marty McFly – one that would change the trajectory of his career. </p><p>"Back to the Future" gave Fox international fame. Fox attended a convention tied to the Robert Zemeckis-directed film a few years ago.</p><p>"I thought, well, I’ll do this for the fans," he told The Times. "I realized — no, it wasn’t for them, it was for me.</p><p>"I wanted to express my gratitude to them. They’ve given me so much, my life is so amazing. The disease sucks, but … people don’t feel sorry for me. They don’t think I’m pathetic. They see me as – well, I couldn’t tell you how they see me, but I sense that they see me as a positive force."</p><p>Fox hasn't given up acting all these years later. He will appear in the upcoming third season of Apple TV+'s "Shrinking," years after taking a step back from the big screen.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>With the final days closing in on an especially messy New Jersey gubernatorial election, Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli’s campaign slammed his Democratic opponent, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, for pushing a narrative that he "killed tens of thousands of people."</p><p>Sherrill accused Ciattarelli of being responsible for printing "propaganda" via the medical publishing company he founded that downplayed the dangers of opioids and of designing an app to help people access dangerous drugs. She made the claims during a gubernatorial debate on Oct. 8 and doubled down during a press conference on opioid addiction on Monday.</p><p>"Jack made millions, the opioid companies made billions, and thousands of New Jerseyans were dying," Sherrill said at the press conference.</p><p>Chris Russell, a Ciattarelli campaign strategist, told Fox News that if Sherrill "had any decency, she would retract her slanderous comments and apologize."</p><p>"Whether it's tripling her net worth in Congress and hiding details of her stock trades or concealing the true extent of her role in the Naval Academy cheating scandal, Mikie Sherrill is a proven liar and lawbreaker whose desperation is showing," said Russell.</p><p>"Her reckless and defamatory claim that Jack 'killed tens of thousands of people, including children,' has been roundly criticized by members of the press, legal scholars and people in both parties," he added.</p><p>"The truth is that Jack Ciattarelli's medical publishing company helped to create an online tool which allowed a small group of chronic pain sufferers to educate themselves on treatment options and better advocate for their own healthcare choices when meeting with their medical professionals," explained Russell.</p><p>In response, Sean Higgins, a campaign spokesperson for Sherrill, told Fox News Digital that "after years of hiding his role fueling the opioid epidemic, Jack Ciattarelli is finally admitting to being paid by an opioid company to create an app to coach patients to get a Hydrocodone prescription, all at a time when the opioid crisis was raging and killing New Jerseyans."</p><p>"He made millions off of New Jerseyans' pain and suffering and clearly cannot be trusted as governor," said Higgins. </p><p>Ciattarelli has threatened to sue Sherrill for defamation if she does not stop raising these accusations.</p><p>Despite this, Sherrill was adamant about the accusations on Monday. </p><p>She pushed back on the threat of lawsuits over the accusations, saying, "I'm dumbfounded that this perennial candidate, who has run now for three elections, saying that he's a small businessman, the minute we start to talk about that small business, he wants to shut it. He wants his lawyers to shut it down. I mean, that's ridiculous to me."</p><p>"I think we've laid out the case that Jack is … in league with these opioid companies," said Sherrill.</p><p>Pressed to clarify whether she was asserting that Ciattarelli killed tens of thousands of New Jerseyans, Sherrill answered, "Yes. Look, I think he is right there with the people that, again, paid billions of dollars. So, I think that the line is pretty clear."</p><p>For his part, Ciattarelli shot back against Sherrill at a campaign rally on Monday, saying, "her entire campaign is based on a stack of lies about me [and] her disdain for the president."</p><p>He said that for the remainder of the campaign he will be pivoting to discussing his day one plan as governor, saying he will immediately issue an executive order banning sanctuary jurisdictions for illegal immigrants, bringing state workers back to work in-person, appointing a state attorney general "who supports both police and parents," fixing the public education system and eliminating green energy initiatives in New Jersey.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Letitia James, New York's indicted attorney general, spoke at a campaign rally for mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani in her first public appearance since the Justice Department <span class="link">charged her with bank fraud</span>. </p><p>James, a longtime foe of President Trump, received a standing ovation from thousands of supporters attending the Democratic nominee's event Monday night at the United Palace Theater in Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood. </p><p>James did not mention Mr. Trump by name, but remained defiant in her remarks. </p><p>"I will not bow, I will not break, I will not bend, I will not capitulate. I will not give in. I will not give up," James said. "You come for me, you gotta come through all of us." </p>
<p>James was <span class="link">indicted</span> on one count of bank fraud and another count of making a false statement, stemming from a house she bought in Virginia. She dismissed the charges as <span class="link">"baseless"</span> shortly after they were announced last week. </p>
<p>At the rally, James wasted no time appearing to take aim at the president. </p><p>"I won't give up and I won't give in. So we have no time to linger and focus on pettiness and revenge. We've gotta press on, press forward, continue the journey, claim the victory ... and so I fear no man," she said.</p><p><span class="link">Mamdani</span>, the Queens assemblyman who won the Democratic primary, has been a champion of James since the beginning. </p><p>"For years, you have fought the good fight for New Yorkers, and now it's our chance to fight for you," Mamdani said. </p>
<p>Mamdani maintains <span class="link">a double-digit lead</span> in polling over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa, who did not appear on the campaign trail Monday. But all three candidates did <span class="link">release statements</span> Monday praising the Israel-Hamas peace plan and release of hostages. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for James said her campaign for reelection next year has raised about $1 million since her indictment, mostly from new donors.</p><p>James is scheduled to make her first appearance in a Virginia federal court on Oct. 24. </p>

<p>A husband and wife were killed when a small plane crashed onto Route 195 in Dartmouth, Massachusetts Monday morning, police said. Both sides of the highway were shut down for hours</p><p>The fuselage of the fixed-wing, single engine plane ended up on the grassy median around 8:15 a.m. and burst into flames, according to Massachusetts State Police. Other parts of the plane were found in the surrounding woods.</p>
<p>A woman who was driving on the highway was "impacted by a portion of the crashed aircraft," Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn said. She was driven to a hospital with injuries that are not considered to be life-threatening.</p><h2>Plane crash victims identified</h2><p>The district attorney identified the victims as 68-year-old Thomas Perkins and his wife, 66-year-old Agatha Perkins. Both are from Middletown, Rhode Island.</p><p>They were found in the fuselage of the plane in the median and pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>Rhode Island State Senator Lou DiPalma represents Middletown and Newport and says the couple is well-known in the area. "This is a big loss to the community and tragic of what happened," DiPalma told WPRI. </p><p>DiPalma said the couple was a part of Kirby-Perkins Construction, the Middletown-based company known for their work in historic restoration and custom homes. </p><p>He says his kids went to school with the Perkins' children at St. Philomena School in Portsmouth. "They were always there and always giving quite a bit back to the school and you always knew they were around," DiPalma said.  </p><h2>NTSB investigating crash</h2><p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is looking into what caused the crash. The agency said the Socata TBM-700 aircraft had flown out of New Bedford Regional Airport. According to Flightradar24, the plane was enroute to Kenosha, Wisconsin. </p>
<p>A photo and video on social media showed the wreckage in flames on the highway in the rain. There was also a wrecked car in the median that belonged to the injured driver.</p>
<p>In a statement, New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell said officials at the airport are prepared to support the investigation led by the NTSB. </p><p>"I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in this morning's tragic plane crash in North Dartmouth," Mayor Mitchell said. "I appreciate the swift and skillful response by New Bedford's emergency responders, as well as the Massachusetts State Police and other state and municipal officials. I am grateful that the crash miraculously did not result in serious injuries to motorists on Interstate 195." </p>
<p>Jen Jacobs was driving on the highway when she saw fiery crash. "I look over and I'm like, that doesn't look like a car. And then, I see the flames. And then I see the flames going all the way across to 195 westbound," Jacobs said. </p><p>She watched as one first responder doused the fuselage with a fire extinguisher. "I looked at the plane and I thought, nothing good is going to come out of this. It was in pieces," Jacobs said.  </p><p>All lanes of travel except the left-most eastbound lane were reopened in time for the evening commute.</p><p>"Troopers will remain at the site overnight to ensure the integrity of the scene until Federal Investigators arrive to conduct their investigation tomorrow," state police said.</p><p>It's not clear yet if the weather was a factor. A <span class="link">nor'easter</span> has been rolling through Massachusetts since Sunday, bringing heavy rain and strong wind to the region. </p>
<p>Dartmouth is about 57 miles south of Boston and 28 miles southeast of Providence, Rhode Island.</p>

<div class="article-title">5 hospitalized after helicopter crashes in busy oceanfront area of Huntington Beach</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Five people, including a child, were hospitalized when a helicopter crashed in the Southern California city of Huntington Beach on Saturday afternoon. </p><p>It happened just after 2 p.m. local time near a parking lot off Pacific Coast Highway, between Beach Boulevard and Twin Dolphins Drive, according to Huntington Beach firefighters. </p><p>City officials tell CBS News that the two people on the helicopter were safely pulled from the wreckage. Three pedestrians on the street were also injured in the incident, and all five people were taken to the hospital for treatment. None of their conditions was known.</p>
<p>Police closed PCH between Huntington Street and Beach Boulevard at around 3 p.m., as they began to investigate the crash. They asked people to avoid the area and use alternate routes for at least several hours after the closure was put into place. </p><p>A dramatic video posted on social media shows the helicopter spinning several times before crashing into palm trees and the outdoor stairway of the pedestrian bridge that runs over PCH to the Hyatt Regency Huntington Beach Resort and Spa. </p><p>Other video footage shows an object falling from the helicopter moments before it plummeted from the sky. </p>
<p>With SkyCal over the scene, scattered debris was seen in the beach access parking lot, a large part of which was blocked off by police tape. The tail of the aircraft broke off in the crash, with the rest of the helicopter still wedged between the staircase and palm trees as of 4:30 p.m.</p><p>There were several other small helicopters parked in the parking lot near where the crash happened, just in front of the Hyatt Regency and Waterfront Beach Resort. An "exclusive helicopter landing party" was being hosted by MD Helicopters at the Offshore 9 Rooftop Lounge on Saturday afternoon, where attendees were invited to "watch helicopters arrive from a bird's eye view." The landing party was scheduled ahead of the Cars 'N Copters On the Coast main event on Sunday.</p><p>Event organizers said that the event was not going to be canceled. </p><p>"We are sending our prayers out to all involved in the unfortunate incident today," said a statement. "Our plan for now is to move forward with our event tomorrow, Sunday, October 12th. We will advise everyone at the earliest possible opportunity if that plan changes."</p>
<p>Witnesses said that the helicopter appeared to dip towards the bridge before it lost control and crashed. </p><p>"You can hear this odd sound that didn't sound right," said Kevin Bullat, who saw the scene unfold. "I looked out and I see the helicopter spiraling out of control. ... My friend saw shrapnel, or just debris, catapulting across PCH."</p><p>It's unclear what caused the helicopter to crash. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have been notified of the crash, city officials said. They believe that an investigation report will be ready within 30 days. </p><p>The helicopter was a Bell 222, which is powered by two turboshaft engines, and was manufactured in 1980. Though officials haven't yet identified any of the victims, CBS News Los Angeles has learned that the helicopter was registered to a man named Eric Nixon. </p><p>An Instagram account named Nixon Helicopters posted to say that both the pilot and passenger were safe and hospitalized following the crash. Other friends of Nixon's also posted on social media, claiming that he broke some ribs and fractured his spine. </p><p>The wreckage was cleared from the parking lot on Monday afternoon. The area was reopened to the public shortly after, but city officials said that the pedestrian bridge would be closed for sometime due to necessary repairs. </p>

<div class="article-title">4 arrests made following mass shooting that killed 6 in Mississippi, FBI says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Four people have been arrested in connection with <span class="link">a weekend shooting</span> that left six dead and more than a dozen injured in a small Mississippi town, the FBI announced Monday.</p><p>Teviyon L. Powell, 29; William Bryant, 29, and Morgan Lattimore, 25, have been charged with capital murder, while Latoya A. Powell, 44, has been charged with attempted murder in the mass shooting, a spokesperson for the FBI's Jackson Field Office confirmed to CBS News.</p><p>It was not immediately clear whether the suspects have attorneys. The Associated Press left a voicemail with the Washington County Public Defender's Office asking if its attorneys are representing the defendants.</p><p>"Other arrests are pending as this investigation continues," the spokesperson said, urging anyone with information about the shooting in the rural northwest Delta region to report tips to the FBI.</p><p>The shooting happened early Saturday morning. It came as people celebrated homecoming weekend in downtown Leland shortly after a high school football game, and was the deadliest of several shootings across Mississippi over the weekend.</p>
<h2>Gun violence reports in Mississippi</h2><p>Another shooting left two people dead at Heidelberg High School on Saturday. It also occurred during a homecoming game. Other shootings were reported at two Mississippi universities on Saturday as those schools celebrated their homecoming weekends.</p><p>Authorities have not disclosed a possible motive for Friday night's shooting in Leland, but the FBI said the gunfire appears to have been "sparked by a disagreement among several individuals."</p><p>Four of the victims died at the scene, where abandoned shoes were left and blood stained the pavement of a downtown street the following day.</p><p>Witness Camish Hopkins described seeing people wounded and bleeding and four people dead on the ground. "It was the most horrific scene I'd ever seen," Hopkins told The AP.</p>
<p>The shooting in Leland was the 14th mass killing in 2025, according to The Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University Mass Killing Database. The database tracks all homicides in the U.S. since 2006 in which four or more people were killed intentionally within a 24-hour period, not including any offender.</p><p>Elsewhere, in the small town of Heidelberg on the east side of the state, the bodies of two people, including a pregnant woman, were found on a high school campus Friday night. That shooting happened the same evening Heidelberg High School played its homecoming football game, according to police and Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves. Police have not said exactly when the gunfire occurred or how close it was to the stadium.</p><p>An 18-year-old man was arrested and charged with two counts of murder and illegally having a gun on a school campus in the Heidelberg shooting, Jasper County Jail records show. </p><p>Heidelberg, a town of about 640 residents, is about 85 miles southeast of the state capital of Jackson.</p><p>On Saturday evening, three people were also found with apparent gunshot wounds on the Alcorn State University campus in Claiborne County, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation said. One of the victims died, the agency said. Police found the victims after a call reporting shots fired in the area of the industrial technology building. No arrests were announced.</p><p>The shooting happened after a crowd of more than 7,000 watched Alcorn State defeat Lincoln University of Oakland, California, in the Mississippi school's homecoming game Saturday afternoon.</p><p>In Jackson, police responded around 7 p.m. Saturday to the tailgating area of Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium, where Jackson State University hosted Alabama State University. A juvenile had been shot in the abdomen and was taken to a hospital, police said. No arrests were announced, and few other details about that shooting were immediately available.</p>

<div class="article-title">Police records reveal new details about Dallas ICE facility shooter</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The parents of the 29-year-old gunman who <span class="link">opened fire on a Dallas immigration facility</span> in September told police their son was "completely normal" before he moved to Washington state and returned home several years ago, believing he had "radiation sickness" and was "allergic to plastic," according to newly released records. </p><p>Joshua Jahn had begun wearing cotton gloves to avoid contact with plastic and practiced target shooting with a newly purchased rifle in Oklahoma a month before the deadly rooftop attack on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building, according to a report written by a Fairview Police Department officer. </p><p>Jahn <span class="link">killed two detainees</span> and wounded another before taking his own life in the Sept. 24 shooting.</p><p>The two deceased victims were identified as Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, 37, from El Salvador, and Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez, 32, from Mexico. Garcia-Hernandez was shot at least eight times during the attack and later died at Parkland Hospital after being taken off life support, according to the League of United Latin American Citizens. </p><p>The wounded victim, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina, was eventually released from the hospital, according to a Department of Homeland Security official.  </p>
<p>The records, obtained by The Associated Press through an open records request, reveal no clues about what may have motivated the attack. Federal authorities said previously that Jahn wrote "ANTI-ICE" on a bullet and left handwritten notes indicating he wanted to ambush and terrorize ICE agents. </p><p>The new records show that on the day of the shooting, Jahn's parents told the FBI he would "occasionally discuss current events" with his mother but rarely engaged in conversations. His parents said he was a "loner" who was "obsessed" with artificial intelligence technology. The parents, Andrew and Sharon Jahn, did not immediately respond Monday to text and phone messages from The AP. </p><p>The documents portray Jahn as an unemployed, friendless young man who had withdrawn into playing computer games in his bedroom at his parents' home in a Dallas suburb. Jahn was not diagnosed with or treated for any mental or physical disorders, his parents said. </p><p>Neither the police nor FBI immediately responded to a request for comment. The FBI said only that because of the government shutdown, it was focused on national security, violations of federal law and essential public safety functions.</p>
<p>Jahn had been "completely normal" until he moved back from Washington state in the past five years, his parents said. He had previously taken classes at a Texas community college on and off for years before driving across the country to answer an online advertisement for a seasonal job harvesting marijuana at a legal cannabis farm in Washington. Jahn appeared directionless and slept in his car for months, the farm's owner, Ryan Sanderson, previously told The AP. </p><p>After returning from Washington because he could not retain a job, Jahn's parents told the FBI he believed he was "allergic to plastic" and sought to avoid direct skin contact with the material. The county where he worked in Washington state was one of the sites for the secret Manhattan Project to develop atomic bombs. And they said their son became convinced that while in Washington, he had been "exposed to radiation from a nearby facility and was suffering from radiation sickness." </p><p>Photographs from the scene of the shooting show a car affixed with a map depicting radioactive fallout in the U.S. </p><p>Records suggest his family life was far from harmonious. Jahn's father had put pressure on his older brother to find a job or join the military after high school, and his mother called the police when the brother failed to show up to a meeting with an Army recruiter to sign enlistment papers in 2014, police records show. </p><p>Jahn's mother called police on his sister one morning when she slept in rather than go to high school, moving out of the home for weeks as a teenager and once spray painting an expletive on the driveway of the family's home.</p><p>But the Jahns financially supported Joshua, their youngest son, as he stayed in his second-floor bedroom and played computer games.</p><p>About a month before Jahn attacked the ICE facility, he went with his father to practice shooting at their property in Durant, Oklahoma, where they are building a new home. While Jahn's father owned several guns, he was surprised to see his son pull an "old rifle" out of his car. Jahn told his father he had "recently" purchased the gun online, police records show.</p>
<p>According to the records, his mother told the FBI she had "no idea" her son owned a gun.</p><p>The FBI said previously that Jahn legally obtained the bolt-action rifle used in the shooting. But police records don't say whether that was the gun Jahn used while target shooting.</p><p>Analysts with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which focuses on hate and extremism, working as part of a program organized by the Center for Internet Security, said it found that Jahn played games online under the username "Frank Hoenniker." The username is apparently a misspelled reference to a cold and calculating character in author Kurt Vonnegut's 1963 satirical novel, "Cat's Cradle," about politics, religion and nuclear proliferation. </p><p>Steam, a game distribution platform, shows Jahn logged more than 11,000 hours on first-person shooter and survival games. </p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>SpaceX launched its <span class="link">Super Heavy-Starship</span> rocket on Monday for the 11th time, marking another successful test flight that built upon previous launches.</p><p><span class="link">Elon Musk</span>, SpaceX founder and CEO, briefly made an appearance on the company's livestream ahead of the launch, saying it was the first time that he was going to be outside to watch the rocket. </p><p>"Normally I'm in mission control and stuff," Musk told the livestream hosts. "It's really going to be much more visceral."</p><p>Shortly after, Starship — the <span class="link">biggest and most powerful rocket</span> ever built — thundered into the evening sky from the southern tip of Texas. The booster peeled away and made a controlled entry into the Gulf as planned, with the spacecraft skimming space before descending into the Indian Ocean. Nothing was being recovered.</p>
<p>It was the 11th test flight for a full-scale Starship, which Musk intends to use to send people to Mars. NASA's need is more immediate. The space agency cannot land astronauts on the moon by decade's end without the 403-foot Starship, the reusable vehicle meant to get them from lunar orbit down to the surface and back up.</p>
<p>The previous test flight in August — a success after <span class="link">a string of explosive failures</span> — followed a similar path with similar goals. More maneuvering was built in this time, especially for the spacecraft. SpaceX planned a series of tests during the spacecraft's entry over the Indian Ocean as practice for future landings back at the launch site.</p>
<p>Like before, Starship carried up eight mock satellites mimicking SpaceX's Starlinks. The entire flight was meant to last just over an hour, originating from Starbase near the Mexican border. </p><p>SpaceX is modifying its Cape Canaveral launch sites to accommodate Starships, in addition to the much smaller Falcon rockets used to transport astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station for NASA.</p>

<div class="article-title">Missouri law targets distracted drivers as officials seek to find hot spots with data</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>On the interstate outside St. Louis, it took Missouri state trooper Brock Teague just minutes to spot a suspected <span class="link">distracted driver</span> with a taillight out and cellphone in hand.</p><p>This time, the driver got a warning, but a ticket can cost $150 for a first offense. It goes up from there, for something Teague says he sees every day.</p><p>"They're just as dangerous if not more than a drunk driver on the highway," Teague said. "They're not paying attention to the road, they're not paying attention to what they're supposed to be doing."</p><p>That's what happened in Columbia, Missouri, in 2019. A distracted driver was video chatting and speeding and crashed into volunteers picking up traffic cones after a triathlon. The crash killed Randall Siddens, a father of three. His youngest was born just a month before he died.</p><p>"They didn't get to know him, which is sad. He would have loved them, they would have loved him," said his widow, Adrienne, who pushed Missouri lawmakers to pass the hands-free law Teague is now enforcing. </p>
<p>"Once it touches your family, you realize just how it only takes an instance," Adrienne Siddens said.</p><p>On average, distracted driving kills about nine people every day in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2023, the last year for which stats were available, about 325,000 people were injured in distracted driving crashes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p><p>Missouri is one of <span class="link">32 states</span>, along with Washington, D.C., that have laws <span class="link">banning handheld cellphones</span> while driving, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association. The state has relied on police crash reports for distracted driving data, but that doesn't tell the whole story.  </p><p>Now, the Department of Transportation is aiming to identify distracted driving hot spots using data gathered anonymously from smartphones and vehicles, data that is often called telematics.</p>
<p>"Our crash reports would tell you that somewhere around 10 to 15% of our fatal crashes involve a distracted driver. When you look at the telematics data, it indicates that it's probably closer to one in three," said Jon Nelson, Missouri's highway safety and traffic engineer. </p><p>"We've learned that like, in the southeast part of our state, there's a higher rate of distracted driving happening there compared to other places of the state," Nelson said.</p><p>He's unsure exactly why that is, but said it's a more rural part of the state where there is less traffic and more open roads. </p><p>"But for us to know that now we can know, hey, maybe we need to increase our educational programs in that area. Law enforcement agencies could increase their visibility in that area," Nelson said.</p><p>Adrienne Siddens said her message is simple. </p><p>"Is it worth it? Would your family's life be worth that? And I think 100% of people would say no," she said.</p>

<div class="article-title">What's next in the Gaza peace plan after Israeli hostages freed</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The next <span class="link">phase of the Gaza peace plan</span> brokered by President Trump moved forward significantly on Monday as Hamas released all of the <span class="link">20 living Israeli hostages</span> in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, and as more aid started to flow into the Palestinian territory after two years of war. </p><p>The steps are crucial parts of <span class="link">President Trump's 20-point peace plan</span>, and they came three days after a <span class="link">ceasefire</span> took effect in Gaza and Israeli troops pulled back to a pre-determined line.</p><p>World leaders, including <span class="link">Mr. Trump</span>, met in Egypt on Monday for a summit on the future of Gaza and the broader Middle East. </p><p>But the situation remains fragile, with major questions over what comes next still to be answered.</p><h2>Negotiations over next steps</h2><p>Israel and Hamas have little trust in each other, and it took a number of failed, indirect negotiations in Doha, Qatar's capital, to get to the truce, with Egypt and Qatar acting as meditators.</p>
<p>The initial phases of the agreement called for: the release of the final hostages held by Hamas, living and dead; the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel; a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza; and a partial pullback by Israeli forces from Gaza's main cities. </p><p>Egypt's foreign minister said on Monday that it was crucial that Israel and Hamas fully implement the first phase of the deal so that the parties can start negotiations on the second phase. As of Monday evening, all living hostages were back in Israel, but the remains of many of the slain captives remained in Gaza.</p><p>"We're very committed to [the peace deal]," Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told CBS News on Monday. "The agreement specifically says 72 hours for when IDF redeploys on the new line ... That is past already, and not all hostages have returned yet, so we understand what we're dealing with."</p><p>Later phases of the plan will have to address thornier issues such as Gaza's postwar governance, Israel's demand that Hamas disarm, which the group has rejected, and Palestinian demands for a state, which the current Israeli government has rejected.</p>
<p>Negotiations over those issues could break down, and Israel has hinted it may resume military operations if its demands are not met.</p><p>President Trump's plan to end the war also stipulates that regional and international partners will work to develop the core of a new Palestinian security force. </p><p>Reconstruction will be another major challenge. The World Bank, and a postwar plan proposed by Egypt, estimates that at least $53 billion will be needed to rebuild the shattered Palestinian territory. Egypt plans to host a future reconstruction conference.</p><h2>Will Hamas disarm?</h2><p>Among the most difficult issues is Israel's insistence that a weakened Hamas completely disarm. Hamas refuses to do that and wants to ensure Israel pulls its troops completely out of Gaza.</p><p>So far, the Israeli military has withdrawn from Gaza City, the southern city of Khan Younis and other areas, but it remains in control of about 53% of the enclave, according to Israeli officials. Troops remain in most of the southern city of Rafah, towns of Gaza's far north, and a wide strip along the length of Gaza's border with Israel.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that Israel was "tightening the noose around Hamas from all sides," and vowed that Gaza would be demilitarized after the Israeli government approved the peace plan, which it did hours later.</p><p>"Hamas will disarm and Gaza will be demilitarized. If this can be achieved the easy way, all the better; if not, it will be achieved the hard way," Netanyahu said, addressing reporters.</p>
<h2>Who will govern Gaza?</h2><p>Israel and Hamas have not agreed on Gaza's postwar governance.</p><p>Under the U.S. plan, an international body is supposed to govern the Palestinian territory, overseeing Palestinian technocrats running day-to-day affairs. Hamas and other factions would not have any role in Gaza's governance.</p><p>The plan envisions an eventual role for Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas' Palestinian Authority — something Netanyahu has long opposed. But it requires the authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, to first undergo a sweeping reform program, and it does not provide any timeline for the process.</p><p>Hamas has said Gaza's government should be worked out among Palestinians.</p><p>The deal also recognizes an independent Palestinian state as, "the aspiration of the Palestinian people," but it's unclear if or when discussions on statehood could take place, and Israel's Netanyahu has repeatedly said he will not allow the creation of a Palestinian state.</p><h2>International security force </h2><p>The plan calls for an Arab-led international security force in Gaza, along with Palestinian police trained by Egypt and Jordan. It says Israeli forces will leave additional areas as those forces deploy.</p><p>Under the plan, the force would work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with the newly trained Palestinian police forces.</p>
<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said the international force needs a U.N. Security Council resolution to endorse its deployment and mandate as a peacekeeping force.</p><p>About 200 U.S. troops are now in Israel to monitor the ceasefire and the early stages of the peace plan. They were expected to carry out that work in conjunction with partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players.</p>

<div class="article-title">Amazon says it plans to hire 250,000 seasonal workers</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Amazon said Monday it plans to hire 250,000 workers this holiday season as it beefs up staffing to handle what the online retailer expects to be an uptick in orders. </p><p>This marks the third year in a row the e-commerce giant has hired at least a quarter of a million additional part- and full-time workers for the busy holiday shopping period from October through December. </p><p>Amazon's hiring spree comes as the overall number of seasonal jobs this year is expected to fall to its <span class="link">lowest level since 2009</span>, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. The outplacement firm attributes the expected decline in seasonal work to higher business costs from U.S tariffs, ongoing inflationary pressures and more reliance by retailers on automation. </p><p>Amazon said its seasonal jobs pay an average of over $19 an hour. Regular full- and part-time employee wages average $23 an hour, plus benefits, according to the company. </p><p>According to Challenger, retailers may add fewer than 500,000 positions this holiday season, down from roughly 543,000 in the final quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike in past years, retailers have been cautious in announcing their seasonal hiring goals. Department store Kohl's recently said it would add temporary positions, but did not indicate how many. Target also said it would add staff for the holidays without specifying how many additional people it planned to hire. </p><p>The more conservative seasonal hiring plans come as the broader job market is cooling. Employers <span class="link">added only 22,000 </span>jobs in August, while private estimates also point to a <span class="link">slowdown in hiring</span>. </p>

<p>Their faces stare down from every street corner in Israel on posters now sun-faded and ripped. Their stories, told by anguished family members, are almost as well-known as celebrities. They are civilians and soldiers, fathers and sons. Some were at the Nova music festival, where almost 400 people were killed and dozens kidnapped.</p><p>On Monday, Hamas — which is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and many other nations — <span class="link">released 20 hostages</span> into the custody of the Red Cross, which then brought them to Israel as part of a new ceasefire deal that many hope will signal an end to two years of war in the devastated Gaza Strip. Under the agreement, all living hostages were to be released, as well as the bodies of the deceased.</p><p>Also Monday, two hostages previously thought to be living were confirmed dead.</p>
<p>The war was triggered by the Hamas-led <span class="link">Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel</span>, when some 1,200 people were killed and 251 kidnapped.</p><p>The fighting has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around half the deaths were women and children, and displaced around 90% of the Gaza population of some 2 million. The United Nations and many independent experts consider the ministry's figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties in Gaza.</p><p>Prior to Monday's release, there were 48 hostages held in Gaza, including the body of one soldier from a previous war. Israel had determined that at least 25 of the hostages were killed on Oct. 7, 2023, or died while in captivity. Just before the release of the first hostages under the ceasefire, Hamas informed Israel that two additional hostages were no longer alive, Tamir Nimrodi and Bipin Joshi. Israel had previously expressed "grave concern" over their status.</p>
<p>There is only one remaining female hostage, who Israel believes was killed in captivity.</p><p>Under the ceasefire agreement that took effect last Friday, the remaining hostages were to be released within 72 hours. Israel released around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange, including 250 people serving life sentences for convictions in attacks on Israelis, in addition to 1,700 seized from Gaza during the war and held without charge.</p><p>President Trump <span class="link">met with some of the hostage families</span> at the Knesset before addressing Israeli lawmakers on Monday, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum said. </p><p>Here is a look at the 20 hostages released Monday:</p>
<h2>Gali Berman and Ziv Berman, 28</h2><p>The fraternal twins were taken from their homes in kibbutz Kfar Aza, on the border with Gaza, during the Oct. 7 attack. Seventeen others were also abducted from Kfar Aza, but the Berman twins were the only hostages from the kibbutz who remained in captivity. The family had heard from hostages who returned in a previous deal that, as of February, the brothers were alive but being held separately. Liran Berman, their older brother, said it's the longest the two have ever spent apart. In Kfar Aza, the twins lived in apartments across from each other. Gali is more outgoing, while Ziv is more reserved and shy with a sharp sense of humor, their brother said.</p><h2>Omri Miran, 48</h2><p>Omri Miran was kidnapped from the Nahal Oz kibbutz. During the attack, terrorists held his family, including his two daughters, ages 2 and 6 months, hostage in the kitchen of a neighbor's house and then broadcast it on Facebook Live. Miran and the father of the other family, Tsachi Idan, were kidnapped. Idan's body was released during the last hostage exchange after he was killed in captivity. Lishay Miran Lavi, Miran's wife, said their younger daughter knew "daddy Omri" only through photos and videos, and didn't really understand what a father is. Moshe Lavi, Miran's brother who lives in New York City, <span class="link">told CBS News New York</span> that Miran's sister and two young nieces survived the mental and physical torture on Oct, 7, but watched as Miran was taken away to Gaza.</p><h2>Matan Angrest, 22</h2><p>Matan Angrest, an Israeli soldier, was taken from his military tank in southern Israel. He is the oldest of four children from Kiryat Bialik, outside of Haifa. His family has been among the most vocal protesters and very critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Last Tuesday, which marked two years since the Oct. 7 attack, his mother, Anat Angrest, addressed her son at a rally. "I know you're in pain, and I can't hug you. I hear you whisper, 'Come for me, Mom,' and I can't protect you," she said.</p><h2>Eitan Mor, 25</h2><p>Eitan Mor was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival, where he helped evacuate people injured in the attack. Mor's parents helped found the Tikva Forum, a loosely organized group of hostage families. They advocated for military pressure, not an immediate ceasefire or hostage release deal, as the best chance for bringing the hostages home. That stance has put Mor's father at odds with many of the other families of hostages. The Israeli military <span class="link">released a photo</span> on Monday showing Eitan Mor beaming in an embrace with his parents.</p><h2>Alon Ohel, 24</h2><p>Alon Ohel, who also has German and Serbian citizenship, was kidnapped at the Nova music festival from a mobile bomb shelter along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an American-Israeli who was killed in captivity in August 2024. A talented pianist, his family has placed pianos across Israel and several sites around the world to raise awareness of his plight. Three other hostages who had been held with Ohel for more than a year were released during the previous ceasefire, including Eli Sharabi, who said Ohel was like his adopted son. Sharabi said they were kept chained for the entire period of their captivity and subsisted on a moldy pita bread per day. Ohel has shrapnel in his eye from the attack on the bomb shelter and his family is worried he may be partially blind. Eli Sharabi, a hostage who was previously freed, <span class="link">told "CBS Sunday Morning"</span> last month that he became a father figure to Ohel in their year-plus together, and when Sharabi found out he was going to be freed, Ohel was not on the list. "You imagine this moment hundreds of times," Sharabi said. "And you believe it's going to be the happiest moment ever. And because of Alon, this moment become very complicated. He had small panic attack. He started to cry and shaking. So, we took water, washed his face, hugging him. It wasn't easy."</p><h2>Guy Gilboa-Dalal, 24</h2><p>Guy Gilboa-Dalal was among those abducted from the Nova music festival, while his brother, Gal, managed to escape. In the past year, Guy has appeared in two videos released by Hamas. In one video, he appears alongside his childhood friend, Evyatar David, with terrorists filming them in a van begging for their freedom and watching their fellow hostages being released nearby to the Red Cross. "The hardest thing for me is that I really went there to watch over him, watch over my baby brother, and I returned without him," <span class="link">Gal Dalal told CBS News</span> in May.</p><h2>Elkana Bohbot, 36</h2><p>Elkana Bohbot was kidnapped from the Nova music festival. In the past year, Hamas has published multiple videos of Bohbot, filmed under duress, including one where he has a fake telephone conversation with his wife, Rivka; their son, Reem; his mother and his brother — pleading with them to help him get out of Gaza. His son made binoculars in kindergarten which he often used to go out and "look for his father," according to Bohbot's mother, Ruhama.</p>
<h2>Rom Braslavski, 21</h2><p>Rom Braslavski was working as a security guard at the Nova festival. He attempted to help festivalgoers evacuate and was wounded in both hands before being kidnapped, witnesses said. In August, the Islamic Jihad militant group released a video of a skeletal Braslavski sobbing and pleading for his life, adding that injuries to his foot prevent him from standing. Later videos of Braslavski and fellow hostage Evyatar David digging their own graves horrified Israelis, sparking some of the largest attendance in months at weekly protests. His father, Ofir, said Rom is usually a strong, happy-go-lucky kid, and that video is the first time he's seen his son cry.</p><h2>Nimrod Cohen, 21</h2><p>Nimrod Cohen was taken from a tank where he was stationed as a soldier in southern Israel. Cohen is obsessed with Rubik's cubes, his family said, and a burned Rubik's cube was found in the tank he was abducted from. This year, his mother, Viki Cohen, illustrated a Passover haggadah, the text laying out the rituals and story recited during the Passover holiday, in honor of hostages, partly because her family stopped celebrating holidays after the attack. "We don't gather as a family, because it reminds us how much he is missing," Cohen said. The only time the extended family would gather is at protests, she said. "The best thing about my son is that he's my son," his father, Yehuda Cohen, <span class="link">told CBS News</span> last week. "He's a normal boy like every other boy. For me, he's special like his brother, sister. We are a normal family. We are a warm, normal family, and we want to get back to being a warm, normal family."</p><h2>Ariel Cunio, 28</h2><p>The youngest of four Cunio brothers, Ariel was kidnapped from the Nir Oz kibbutz about a mile from Gaza with his girlfriend, Arbel Yehoud, and her brother, Dolev, a married father of four who was later killed in captivity. According to news reports, Cunio and Yehoud had returned from an extended trip to South America weeks before the attack and had just adopted a puppy. Yehoud was released during the ceasefire in January.</p><h2>David Cunio, 35</h2><p>David Cunio, brother of Ariel Cunio, was kidnapped with his wife, Sharon, and their 3-year-old twins from the Nir Oz kibbutz. Sharon's sister Danielle and her 5-year-old daughter, who were visiting, also were kidnapped. All were released in November, except for David Cunio. In July, Sharon shared a photo of the twins marking their fifth birthday, their second without their father, writing on Facebook that the girls have changed so much while he's been in captivity that "they're not the same little girls he knew."</p><h2>Evyatar David, 24</h2><p>Evyatar David was taken hostage at the Nova music festival along with his childhood friend, Guy Gilboa-Dalal. In August, Hamas released a video of David, gaunt and pale, who said he was digging his own grave. The condition of the hostages in the videos horrified Israelis and led tens of thousands of protesters to take to the streets and demand a ceasefire deal, in one of the largest turnouts for the weekly hostage protests in months.</p><h2>Maksym Harkin, 37</h2><p>Maksym Harkin was abducted from Nova, which was the first festival he had ever attended, according to his family. Harkin was born in Ukraine and moved to Israel with his family, where he lived in the city of Tirat HaCarmel in the north. He has a 3-year-old daughter and was the primary provider for his mother and 11-year-old brother. Just before he was taken, his mother said he sent a final text message that said, "I love you." In July, Hamas released a video of him filmed under duress several months prior.</p><h2>Eitan Horn, 38</h2><p><span class="link">Eitan Horn</span>, originally from the city of Kfar Saba, was visiting his brother Iair at the Nir Oz kibbutz on Oct. 7. Both were kidnapped. For most of the war, the two were held with three other hostages in a filthy cell underground. In early February, terrorists filmed the emotional interaction between the brothers as they were told that Iair would be released and Eitan would stay in Gaza. Since his release, Iair Horn has campaigned for his brother and the other hostages, flying frequently to the United States and meeting with politicians.</p>
<h2>Segev Kalfon, 27</h2><p>Segev Kalfon was kidnapped from the Nova music festival, where he was last seen attempting to flee terrorists along the highway. Before the attack, he worked at his family's bakery in Dimona, in southern Israel. The middle child of three, Kalfon had recently been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, a condition his family has highlighted in urging his release. Kalfon's family received a sign of life from him after the last ceasefire, when some of the hostages said they were held with him for months. Kalfon's family has focused on religious rituals in their fight for his release, including traveling to the grave of prominent rabbis and dedicating a Torah scroll in his honor.</p><h2>Bar Kupershtein, 23</h2><p>Bar Kupershtein was working at the Nova festival as a security guard when he was abducted. Witnesses said Kupershtein stayed at the festival to try to provide first aid to people who had been shot and injured. Kupershtein was the main financial support for his family after his father was severely injured in an accident several years ago, his aunt, Ora Rubinstein, told reporters. She said that his father worked with a physical therapist to regain the ability to speak, so he could meet with politicians to advocate for his son's release. He has told the family that he would walk again when his son came home, she said.</p><h2>Yosef-Chaim Ohana, 25</h2><p>Yosef-Chaim Ohana was kidnapped from the Nova music festival, where he was working as a bartender. Witnesses saw him attempting to help others escape before he was kidnapped. He is the oldest of three brothers, one of whom died from an illness about 15 years ago.</p><h2>Avinatan Or, 32</h2><p>Avinatan Or was kidnapped from the Nova music festival along with his girlfriend, N<span class="link">oa Argamani,</span> who was rescued by Israeli forces in June 2024. On Oct. 7, Hamas released a video of the pair that has become one of the most well-known videos from that day. It showed Argamani on an all-terrain vehicle crying, "Don't kill me!" and reaching out her arms to Or, who is being marched away from her by terrorists. Or worked in tech in Tel Aviv before his abduction.</p><h2>Matan Zangauker, 25</h2><p>Matan Zangauker was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz along with his girlfriend, Ilana Gritzewsky. The two met while working on a medical cannabis farm there. Gritzewsky was released after 55 days and has since advocated tirelessly for his release, wearing a hat of Zangauker's she rescued from their burned home. His mother, Einav, has been a constant presence at protests, giving impassioned speeches and even being hoisted in a cage above the crowd to draw attention to the hostages' plight. Zangauker, who said she was previously a Netanyahu supporter, has emerged as one of his harshest critics.</p><h2>Two hostages determined to be dead on Monday</h2><h2>Bipin Joshi, 24</h2><p>Bipin Joshi arrived in Israel from his native Nepal a month before the attack. He was the only non-Israeli hostage believed to be alive in Gaza. He came to Israel on a student exchange to work and study agriculture at kibbutz Alumim on the Gaza border. Ten of the 17 Nepali students in the program were killed during the attack. Joshi, who was able to throw a number of live grenades out of the bomb shelter where they were hiding, was injured and kidnapped. Joshi's sister, 17-year-old Pushpa Joshi, regularly travels eight hours one way on buses to Kathmandu from her home in western Nepal to lobby to secure her brother's release. In August, his family traveled to Israel to meet with President Isaac Herzog and join families demonstrating in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square. Last week, Joshi's family released footage of him in captivity filmed under duress from around November 2023.</p><h2>Tamir Nimrodi, 20</h2><p>Tamir Nimrodi was taken from Erez, a crossing on the northern border of Gaza that had been the main route for people entering and leaving the territory. He had been serving with the Israeli defense body overseeing humanitarian aid in Gaza. Nimrodi was taken with two other soldiers by terrorists who walked them to the Gaza gate and forced them to cross. Israel confirmed the deaths of the two soldiers who were taken with Nimrodi. There had been no sign of life from Nimrodi in the two years since he was seen in footage walking into Gaza in shorts and a T-shirt without his glasses. Herut Nimrodi, his mother, said she didn't know what was worse: to think he had been killed in captivity, or that he was alive but being held in terrible conditions. "I'm scared to even imagine," she said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump hails "historic dawn of a new Middle East" in speech to Knesset</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump hailed " the historic dawn of a new Middle East" in <span class="link">remarks</span> to Israeli lawmakers at the Knesset on Monday, after all living <span class="link">hostages were reunited</span> with their families. </p><p>The president received repeated standing ovations from the Israeli parliament during his more than hour-long speech Monday, as he declared the start of a new era in the Middle East and peace for Israel. The hostages were released to the Red Cross in Gaza early Monday, before being taken to be reunited with their families in Israel, more than two years after Hamas launched its deadly assault on Oct. 7, 2023. </p><p>"After two harrowing years in darkness and captivity, 20 courageous hostages are returning to the glorious embrace of their families, and it is glorious," Mr. Trump said. "Twenty-eight more precious loved ones are coming home at last to rest in this sacred soil for all of time. And after so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today, the skies are calm, the guns are silent, the sirens are still, and the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace, a land and a region that will live, God willing, in peace for all eternity."</p><p>He called it "a brilliant point in time" and told the Knesset, "Generations from now, this will be remembered as the moment that everything began to change, and change very much for the better, like the USA right now, it will be the golden age of Israel, and the golden age of the Middle East."</p><p>Mr. Trump singled out for praise special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who was at the forefront of negotiations and critical in reaching a deal all parties could sign. Mr. Trump lauded Witkoff, who was a real estate developer before he joined the Trump administration, for his negotiating skills but said he thinks his likeability is what makes him so successful. The Knesset chamber erupted in applause for Witkoff.</p>
<p>"Steve started this all by himself," Mr. Trump said of the peace deal. "I call him Henry Kissinger who doesn't leak, okay? Henry was a big leaker. He leaked. Steve doesn't leak. Steve just wants to get the job done, he wants to do what's right." </p><p>Two Israeli lawmakers who held up signs saying "Recognize Palestine" and interrupted Mr. Trump's remarks at the Knesset were ejected from the parliament.</p><p>The president also made light of the critics he said had predicted that he'd "drag" the U.S. into more wars. </p><p>"But when you settle eight wars in eight months, that means you don't like war," he said.</p>
<p>"Everyone thought I was going to be brutal. In fact, l remember Hillary Clinton during a debate, she said, 'Look at him, look at him, he's going to go to war with everybody.' And actually, she said, 'He's got a personality that's all about war.' No, my personality actually is all about stopping wars, and it seems to work. Seems to work."</p><p>But on Friday, Clinton, who was secretary of state during the Obama administration and lost the 2016 presidential election to Mr. Trump and has long had an acrimonious relationship with him, had words of praise for Mr. Trump and the Israel-Hamas deal he brokered. In an <span class="link">interview</span> with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, Clinton called it "a significant step" and added, "I really commend President Trump and his administration" and Arab leaders in the region for committing to the 20-point peace plan. </p><p>In one of the more awkward moments of the president's lengthy remarks, he called for Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, apparently in reference to <span class="link">corruption charges</span> Netanyahu has been fighting for years. </p><p>"I have an idea. Mr President, why don't you give him a pardon? Give him a pardon," Mr. Trump said, turning to Herzog. </p><p>"By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know! But I happen to like this gentleman right  over here, and it just seems to make so much sense."</p><p>The president also told Netanyahu the timing of the agreement to end the war is "brilliant," and he suggested continuing the war could have been politically perilous for the prime minister. Netanyahu's offensive in Gaza was <span class="link">condemned</span> by a number of countries over severe restrictions on the distribution of food to Palestinians and the killing of civilians. He has also been harshly criticized by his own people and was booed in Hostage Square Saturday night when Witkoff mentioned his name. </p><p>"The world wanted peace and Israel wanted peace, everybody did," Mr. Trump said. "What a victory it's been. If you'd kept going on for three, four years fighting, fighting, fighting, it was getting bad, it was getting heated. The timing of this is brilliant and I said, 'Bibi you're going to be remembered for this for far more than if you kept this going, going, going, kill, kill, kill.' It would not be the same. And I just want to congratulate you for having the courage — that's it."</p>
<p>He urged Israelis to focus now on peace and reconstruction: "We've won, and now let's rebuild our lives and make it stronger and bigger and better than ever before."</p><p>The president met with some of the Israeli hostages' families at the Knesset before delivering his remarks, according to the Hostage and Missing Families Forum. Afterward, the president traveled to Egypt for a peace signing ceremony. </p>

<div class="article-title">Possible Nobel leak was likely espionage, committee secretary says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A potential leak that preceded the announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader <span class="link">Maria Corina Machado</span> was "highly likely" the result of espionage, the Nobel Institute told Norwegian media on Saturday.</p><p>The odds of Machado winning the prize jumped from 3.75% to nearly 73% overnight, Thursday to Friday on the predictive betting platform Polymarket.</p><p>However, no expert or media outlet had mentioned her as being among the favorites for the prize, which was announced just a few hours later in Oslo.</p><p>"Highly likely it's espionage," the director of the Nobel Institute and secretary of the Nobel committee, Kristian Berg Harpviken, told Norway's TV2 television.</p><p>On Friday, the head of the Nobel committee said he didn't believe Machado's name had been leaked.</p>
<p>"I don't think there have ever been any leaks in the entire history of the prize. I can't imagine that's the case," committee chairman Jorgen Watne Frydnes told the NTB news agency.</p><p>Harpviken said the institute would nevertheless investigate and "where necessary, we will further tighten security".</p><p>Espionage "could make it appear as if someone on the inside deliberately leaked information. That is not likely," he said.</p><p>"It's too certain to say for sure, but it's no secret that the Nobel Institute is subject to espionage," he added.</p>
<p>"It is obvious that the institution is of interest to actors who want to acquire information, both states and other organizations," he said, adding: "The motives can be both political and economic."</p><p>"This has been going on for many decades."</p><p>Harpviken did not respond to AFP's requests for comment.</p><p>An extremely limited number of people know in advance the name of the laureate chosen by the five members of the Nobel Committee.</p><p>In the past, unexpected names of Nobel nominees have emerged in the Norwegian media, fuelling speculation about possible leaks. But this has not been the case in recent years.</p><p>Machado, an opposition leader barred from running in Venezuela's 2024 presidential election, was awarded "for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy", the committee said.</p><p>A video shared on social media showed Harpviken calling Machado on Friday morning to inform her that she had been chosen for the coveted prize. He is visibly emotional while sharing the news during a phone call with Machado before it was announced to the world.</p>
<p>"Oh my God. I have no words. Thank you so much," Machado can be heard saying during the call. "I hope you understand this is a movement, this is an achievement for a whole society. I am just one person; I certainly do not deserve this. Oh my God."</p>

<div class="article-title">Alaska hit by severe flooding that carries away homes</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The remnants of Typhoon Halong brought hurricane-force winds and catastrophic flooding to coastal communities in western Alaska on Sunday, pushing entire houses off their foundations.  </p><p>Rescue aircraft were dispatched to the tiny Alaskan villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, where there were reports of up to 20 people possibly unaccounted for, said Jeremy Zidek, spokesperson for the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.</p><p>"We have received reports that people's homes have floated away and that people were potentially in those homes," Zidek told The Associated Press.</p><p>Alaska State Troopers said both Kipnuk and Kwigillingok were hit by "strong winds and heavy flooding, which caused significant damage, including at least eight homes being pushed from their foundations."</p><p>In Kwigillingok, at least 18 people were rescued, while at least 16 people were rescued in Kipnuk, Alaska State Troopers said Sunday evening local time. Three people were still unaccounted for in Kwigillingok as of 6:50 p.m. local time. Troopers had also received reports of people still unaccounted for in Kipnuk but couldn't confirm the exact number.</p>
<p>"Search efforts will be continuing overnight as conditions allow," the troopers said in a statement Sunday evening. ... "This is an active and ongoing search and rescue effort."</p><p>That effort was being coordinated by the Alaska State Troopers, with assistance from the Alaska Air National Guard, Alaska Army National Guard and U.S. Coast Guard, the troopers pointed out.    </p><p>More than a dozen agencies are involved in the disaster response, CBS Fairbanks affiliate KXDF-TV reported, including the Alaska National Guard. </p><p>"The Alaska Organized Militia, which includes the Alaska National Guard, Alaska State Defense Force, and Alaska Naval Militia, has been requested to activate up to 60 members to assist with storm response operations across affected western Alaska communities," the National Guard wrote Saturday.</p>
<h2>Alaska governor: "Help is on the way"</h2><p>According to the nonprofit Coastal Villages Region Fund, nearly 600 people in Kipnuk were taking shelter at a local school while around 300 were sheltering in a school in Kwigillingok.</p><p>Roads and boardwalks were inundated and power lines were damaged in Bethel, Napaskiak, Napakiak, and other Yukon-Kuskokwim communities. Crews worked to clear the airport runway in Bethel, which was littered with debris from high winds. The area is among the most isolated in the U.S., and some communities have few roads and residents use boardwalks, boats and snowmobiles to get around, Zidek said.</p><p>"Every effort will be made to help those hit by this storm. Help is on the way," Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a statement.</p><p>Dunleavy also said he has expanded the state's disaster declaration to include areas impacted by the storm. He initially issued the disaster declaration Thursday in western Alaska following another powerful storm.</p>

<div class="article-title">Death toll from torrential rains in Mexico rises to 64 as search expands</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>POZA RICA, Mexico — Fifteen minutes before water from a flooded stream swept into her home, Lilia Ramírez took off running with what little she could carry. When she returned she found not only damage from the water that had flooded her first floor to the ceiling, but the oil it had carried now streaking her walls.</p>
<p>Poza Rica is an oil town, and among the challenges confronting some residents who fled flooding that has killed 64 people across five states and left 65 missing, is residue from the oil that built this city not far from the Gulf of Mexico. Authorities say some 100,000 homes across the region have been damaged by the torrential rains and flooding.</p> <p>"Never before has it been tarred before like that," Ramírez said Monday standing in her devastated ground floor, where walls that had once been pink were now vertically striped with black.</p>
<p>Mexico has deployed some 10,000 troops in addition to civilian rescue teams. Helicopters have ferried food and water to the 200 some communities that remained cut off by ground and carried out the sick and injured.</p> <p>"There are sufficient resources, this won't be skimped on ... because we're still in the emergency period," President Claudia Sheinbaum said during her daily press briefing Monday.</p> <p>But on some streets in Poza Rica, 170 miles (275 kilometers) northeast of Mexico City, the cleanup of mud and debris was complicated by thick oil deposits on trees, roofs and vehicles tossed by the current that swept through Friday.</p>
<p>Parts of Veracruz state received some 24.7 inches (62.7 centimeters) of rain from Oct. 6 to 9.</p> <p>Ramírez said that at other times of heavy rains, the state oil company Pemex had drained nearby areas with oil to avoid it spreading.</p> <p>Roberto Olvera, one of her neighbors, said that a siren from a nearby Pemex facility alerted them to danger. "It was a really anguishing moment because a lot of people from the neighborhood stayed behind and some perished," he said.</p> <p>Pemex said in a brief statement to the AP that so far it did not have reports of an oil spill in the area.</p>
<p>Sheinbaum acknowledged it could still be days before access is established to some places. "A lot of flights are required to take sufficient food and water" to those places, she said.</p> <p>The president denied that government systems had failed to provide sufficient warning. "It would have been difficult to have had much advance knowledge of this situation, (it's) different from with hurricanes," she said.</p> <p>Mexico's Civil Protection agency said the heavy rains had killed 29 people in Veracruz state on the Gulf Coast as of Monday morning, and 21 people in Hidalgo state, north of Mexico City. At least 13 were killed in Puebla, east of Mexico City. Earlier, in the central state of Querétaro, a child died in a landslide.</p> <p>Authorities have attributed the deadly downpours to two tropical systems that formed off the western coast of Mexico and have since dissipated, Hurricane Pricilla and Tropical Storm Raymond.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>SpaceX launched another of its mammoth Starship rockets on a test flight Monday, successfully making it halfway around the world while releasing mock satellites like last time.</p> <p>Starship — the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built — thundered into the evening sky from the southern tip of Texas. The booster peeled away and made a controlled entry into the Gulf of Mexico as planned, with the spacecraft skimming space before descending into the Indian Ocean. Nothing was recovered.</p> <p>"Hey, welcome back to Earth, Starship," SpaceX's Dan Huot announced as employees cheered. "What a day."</p> <p>It was the 11th test flight for a full-scale Starship, which SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk intends to use to send people to Mars. NASA's need is more immediate. The space agency cannot land astronauts on the moon by decade's end without the 403-foot (123-meter) Starship, the reusable vehicle meant to get them from lunar orbit down to the surface and back up.</p>
<p>Instead of remaining inside Launch Control as usual, Musk said that for the first time he was going outside to watch — "much more visceral."</p> <p>The previous test flight in August — a success after a string of explosive failures — followed a similar path with similar goals. More maneuvering was built in this time, especially for the spacecraft. SpaceX conducted a series of tests during the spacecraft's entry over the Indian Ocean as practice for future landings back at the launch site.</p> <p>Like before, Starship carried up eight mock satellites mimicking SpaceX's Starlinks. The entire flight lasted just over an hour, originating from Starbase near the Mexican border.</p> <p>NASA's acting administrator Sean Duffy praised Starship's progress. "Another major step toward landing Americans on the moon's south pole," he said via X.</p> <p>SpaceX is modifying its Cape Canaveral launch sites to accommodate Starships, in addition to the much smaller Falcon rockets used to transport astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station for NASA.</p>

<div class="article-title">Madagascar's president flees country in fear for his life after military rebellion</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar — Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina said he has fled the country in fear for his life following a military rebellion but did not announce his resignation in a speech broadcast on social media late Monday from an undisclosed location.</p> <p>Rajoelina has faced weeks of Gen Z-led anti-government protests, which reached a pivotal point on Saturday when an elite military unit joined the protests and called for the president and other government ministers to step down. That prompted Rajoelina to say that an illegal attempt to seize power was underway in the Indian Ocean island and leave the country.</p>
<p>"I was forced to find a safe place to protect my life," Rajoelina said in his late-night speech, which was also meant to be shown on Madagascar television but was delayed for hours after soldiers attempted to take control of the state broadcaster buildings, according to the president's office.</p> <p>The speech was ultimately broadcast on the presidency's official Facebook page but not on national TV.</p>
<p>They were Rajoelina's first public comments since the CAPSAT military unit turned against his government in an apparent coup and joined thousands of protesters rallying in a main square in the capital, Antananarivo, over the weekend.</p> <p>Rajoelina called for dialogue "to find a way out of this situation" and said the constitution should be respected. He did not say how he left Madagascar or where he was, but a report claimed he was flown out of the country on a French military plane.</p> <p>A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson declined to comment on that report.</p> <p>Madagascar is a former French colony and Rajoelina reportedly has French citizenship, which has been a source of discontent for some Madagascans for years.</p> <p>The anti-government protests began on Sept. 25 over chronic water and electricity outages but have snowballed into wider discontent with Rajoelina and his government.</p>
<p>It is the most significant unrest in the island nation of 31 million people off the east coast of Africa since Rajoelina himself first came to power as the leader of a transitional government following a 2009 military-backed coup.</p> <p>The same elite CAPSAT military unit that rebelled against Rajoelina was prominent in him first coming to power in 2009.</p> <h2 class="edTag"><strong>Elite unit claims to control the military</strong></h2>
<p>Rajoelina hasn't identified who was behind this attempted coup, but the CAPSAT unit has said it now controls all the armed forces in Madagascar and has appointed a new officer in charge of the military, which was accepted by the defense minister in Rajoelina's absence.</p> <p>CAPSAT appears to be in a position of authority and also has the backing of other military units, including the gendarmerie security forces.</p> <p>A commander of CAPSAT, Col. Michael Randrianirina, said the army had "responded to the people's calls" but denied there was a coup. Speaking at the country's military headquarters on Sunday, he told reporters that it was up to the Madagascan people to decide what happens next, and if Rajoelina leaves power and a new election is held.</p> <p>Randrianirina said his soldiers had decided to stand with protesters and had exchanged gunfire with security forces who were attempting to quell weekend protests, and one of his soldiers was killed. But there was no major fighting on the streets, and soldiers riding on armored vehicles and waving Madagascar flags were cheered by people in Antananarivo.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in Madagascar still advised American citizens to shelter in place because of a "highly volatile and unpredictable" situation. The African Union urged all parties, "both civilian and military, to exercise calm and restraint."</p> <h2 class="edTag"><strong>Weeks of protests</strong></h2> <p>Madagascar has been shaken by three weeks of deadly anti-government protests that were initially led by a group calling itself "Gen Z Madagascar."</p> <p>The United Nations says the demonstrations left at least 22 people dead and dozens injured and criticized Madagascan authorities for a "violent response" to what were largely peaceful protests in the early days of the movement. The government has disputed the number of deaths.</p>
<p>The demonstrators have brought up a range of issues, including poverty and the cost of living, access to tertiary education, and alleged corruption and embezzlement of public funds by government officials, as well as their families and associates.</p> <p>Civic groups and trade unions also joined the protests, which resulted in nighttime curfews being enforced in Antananarivo and other major cities. Curfews were still in effect in Antananarivo and the northern port city of Antsiranana.</p>
<p>The Gen Z protesters who started the uprising have mobilized over the internet and say they were inspired by the protests that toppled governments in Nepal and Sri Lanka.</p> <h2 class="edTag"><strong>History of political crises</strong></h2> <p>Madagascar has had several leaders removed in coups and has a history of political crises since it gained independence from France in 1960.</p> <p>The 51-year-old Rajoelina first came to prominence as the leader of a transitional government following the 2009 coup that forced then-President Marc Ravalomanana to flee the country and lose power. Rajoelina was elected president in 2018 and reelected in 2023 in a vote boycotted by opposition parties.</p> <p>Madagascar's former prime minister under Rajoelina and one of the president's closest advisers have also fled the country and arrived in the nearby island of Mauritius in the predawn hours Sunday, the Mauritian government said. Mauritius said it was "not satisfied" that the private plane had landed on its territory.</p>

<div class="article-title">In Marc Maron's last 'WTF' podcast episode, Obama offers advice on closing chapters</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The bi-weekly podcast by actor and comedian Marc Maron ended with presidential flair — capping a more than 15-year run that reached millions of listeners.</p> <p>Episode 1,686 of <em>WTF with Marc Maron</em> dropped on Monday featuring former President Barack Obama as the final guest.</p> <p>At the start of the episode, Maron explained that he wanted to speak with someone who can help not only reflect on the podcast's legacy, but how he and his listeners should navigate the world. He also wanted insight from the former president on the current state of politics moving forward.</p> <p>"And how do we do it with some grace and perhaps some hope and some focus," Maron said, asking how to engage in civil discourse.</p>
<p>Obama first appeared on <em>WTF</em> back in 2015, recording from inside Maron's garage. For the second conversation, Maron said it was only fair that this time he host the show from Obama's house in Washington, D.C.</p> <p>During their hour-long talk, the two spoke about President Trump's second administration, the impact of social media and the need to treat others with decency and respect.</p> <p>Maron launched <em>WTF</em> with producer Brendan McDonald in September 2009 when podcasting started to gain traction. Over the years, it became the go-to spot for in-depth conversations with actors, directors, writers and most notably, other comedians. Some entertainers who appeared on the podcast include Robin Williams, Louis C.K. and Lorne Michaels.</p> <p><em>WTF  </em>won several awards throughout the years, including Best Comedy Podcast in 2016 by the Academy of Podcasters.</p> <p>In July, Maron told <em>NPR's Fresh Air</em> that ending the podcast was a difficult decision, but that he and McDonald had reached a point where they were proud of what they created and were feeling burnt out.</p>
<p>"I just don't think there's any shame in stopping if moving forward would compromise either my or Brendan's vision of the thing or our ability to do it," he said on <em>Fresh Air</em>. "We've maintained our audience all these years, and a lot of them are very close to me. And oddly, the decision made sense to a lot of them."</p> <p>Part of Maron's charm on<em> WTF </em>was his vulnerability. He openly discussed his struggles with anxiety, loss and past addiction to drugs and alcohol.<em> </em>During the last episode of <em>WTF</em>, Maron told Obama that he was ready for the break but he also felt some nervousness about what comes next.</p>
<p>"There is sort of a fear there, of what do I do now?" he said.</p> <p>"There is a feeling of like, how am I going to feel less alone? How am I going to deal with my mental this or that? And how am I going to find, you know, a way to exist in the world that we're living in?" Maron added.</p>
<p>The former president responded by sharing how he adjusted to life after leaving the White House.</p> <p>"Don't rush into what the next thing is. Take a beat and take some satisfaction," Obama said. "Pat yourself on the back for a second."</p>

<div class="article-title">Ecuador: La reinvención andina de la cumbia</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p><em>Esta cobertura es parte de una serie especial, </em><em>Cumbia across Latin America</em><em>, un reportaje visual en seis países documentado durante varios años, que abarca seis países y cubre a las personas, lugares y culturas que mantienen vivo este género musical.</em></p>
<p>La primera cumbia grabada en Ecuador a finales de la década de 1960 tenía solo una estrofa. Se llamaba "Cumbia Triste" y fue escrita por Polibio Mayorga. Este músico de Ambato, Ecuador, tropicalizó la música nacional de la Sierra ecuatoriana, que había sido estigmatizada por considerarse demasiado triste o demasiado indígena. Mayorga combinó los ritmos del sanjuanito —música tradicional andina— con la cumbia rural colombiana, que llegó a Ecuador a través de la industria discográfica, ya procesada y blanqueada. El resultado marcó una nueva identidad para muchos migrantes provincianos que llegaron a poblar los centros urbanos del país.</p>
<p>Mientras Polibio Mayorga sentó las bases del sonido de la cumbia ecuatoriana, fueron músicos como Medardo Luzuriaga quienes transformaron el género en una sensación nacional. Su hijo, Manuel Luzuriaga, forma parte de la orquesta de cumbia Los Cumbancheros y, cuando habla de su padre, le brillan los ojos. Medardo fue maestro de Manuel y uno de los músicos más respetados en la historia de las orquestas de cumbia en Ecuador. A fines de los años 60, Medardo creó la orquesta Don Medardo y sus Players. Grabó más de 100 discos, y sus cumbias emblemáticas, como "Cumbia Chonera" y "La Novia", aún viven en la conciencia colectiva del país. Muchos de sus hijos y nietos fundaron varias orquestas tras su muerte, todas ellas siguen tocando su repertorio dorado.</p>
<p>Estefanny Guerrero quiso ser una "Canelita" desde los cinco años. Con sus botas y extensiones rojas sobre la mesa, cantaba las canciones de Tierra Canela, un grupo femenino de tecnocumbia que recluta jóvenes de todo el país. Miles participaron en la última convocatoria para encontrar nuevas integrantes. Algunos músicos y espectadores critican al grupo, diciendo que solo son caras bonitas y cuerpos sexys, pero ellas pasan largas horas en clases de canto y baile, y saben animar a cualquier público. La tecnocumbia, un producto de consumo masivo, mezcla ritmos indígenas de Ecuador y Perú para hacerlos bailables.</p>
<p>Guerrero finalmente llegó a Tierra Canela y aún usa extensiones de cabello rojo. La joven de 31 años cuenta que próximamente se retirará dignamente del grupo, para evitar que la saquen por "vieja." Los managers prefieren que las integrantes no digan su verdadera edad en entrevistas, tampoco les permiten decir que son mamás o que tienen novios para mantener una imagen. A pesar de todas estas restricciones y exigencies, son ellas las que muchas veces sostienen económicamente a sus familias.</p>

<div class="article-title">Ecuador: The Andean reinvention of cumbia</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p><em>This is part of a special series, </em><em>Cumbia Across Latin America</em><em>, a visual report across six countries developed over several years, covering the people, places and cultures that keep this music genre alive.</em></p>
<p>The first cumbia recorded in Ecuador at the end of the 1960s had only one verse. It was called "Cumbia Triste" and was written by Polibio Mayorga. This musician from Ambato, Ecuador, tropicalized the national music of the Ecuadorian highlands, which had long been stigmatized for its Indigenous roots and the sad melodies often associated with them. Mayorga combined the rhythms of the San Juanito — traditional Andean music — with rural Colombian cumbia, which arrived in Ecuador via the record industry, already processed and whitewashed. The result marked a new identity for many provincial migrants who came to populate the country's urban centers.</p>
<p>While Polibio Mayorga laid the groundwork for an Ecuadorian cumbia sound, it was musicians like Medardo Luzuriaga who transformed the genre into a national sensation. His son Manuel Luzuriaga plays for the cumbia orchestra Los Cumbancheros and when he talks about his father, his eyes shine. Medardo was Manuel's teacher and one of the most respected musicians in the history of cumbia orchestras in Ecuador. At the end of the '60s, Medardo created the orchestra Don Medardo y sus Players. Medardo recorded more than 100 albums, and his emblematic cumbias, including "Cumbia Chonera" and "La Novia," still live in the collective conscience of the entire country. Many of his children and grandchildren created multiple orchestras after his death, all still playing his golden repertoire.</p>
<p>Estafanny Guerrero has wanted to be a "Canelita" since she was 5 years old. Standing with her boots and red hair extensions on the table, she sang the songs of Tierra Canela, a female tecnocumbia group that hires young women from all over the country. Thousands participated in the latest callout to find new members. Some musicians and spectators criticize the group, saying they're just pretty faces and sexy bodies, but they spend long hours in singing and dancing classes, and can fire up any audience. Tecnocumbia, a product of mass consumption, mixes Indigenous rhythms from Ecuador and Peru to make them danceable.</p>
<p>Guerrero eventually made it to Tierra Canela and still wears red hair extensions. The 31-year-old says that she plans to withdraw from the group soon — to avoid being kicked out for being "too old." The group's managers prefer its members, who are often supporting their families, conceal their real ages and not disclose whether they're mothers or if they have boyfriends in interviews.</p>

<div class="article-title">Tackles, projectiles and gunfire: Many fear ICE tactics are growing more violent</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>There are countless videos on social media showing similar scenes. One, filmed by a photographer in Hyattsville, Md., shows a man pinned to the ground by two ICE officers. He pleads in Spanish and English for someone to help him.</p> <p>During the incident, one of the officers drops his gun and fumbles for it. Then, he appears to point it at bystanders. Emily Covington, an assistant director in ICE's Office of Public Affairs, told NPR in a statement that drawing a weapon can be used as a de-escalation tactic.</p> <p>Another video, from Broadview, Ill., near Chicago, appears to show a man outside an ICE facility getting shot in the head with a pepper ball, a projectile filled with chemical irritants. That man, Pastor David Black, has sued the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Late last month, a local CBS reporter said a masked ICE agent fired a pepper ball at her car at that same facility, causing her to vomit for hours. The reporter, Asal Rezaei, said there was no protest happening at the time. Broadview Police are now investigating.</p> <p>"These are just the tip of the iceberg," says Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. "People being tackled, people getting pepper sprayed or tear gassed. We've seen people getting threatened. And we've seen at least two incidents involving gunfire."</p> <p>A majority of Americans do not approve of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics, according to a recent survey from <em>The New York Times</em> and Siena University. Yet in Chicago, immigrant advocate groups say federal immigration officers are escalating those tactics and becoming more violent.</p> <p>"This administration overall seems more interested in heightening the tensions instead of trying to ramp them down," Tsao says.</p> <p>In late September, federal officers broke down doors and arrested dozens of people during a massive apartment raid on Chicago's south side.</p> <p>Earlier this month, federal officers shot a woman in the city, and a few weeks before, they killed a man in a nearby suburb. In both shootings, officials at the Department of Homeland Security said the victims threatened officers. But in body camera footage from the fatal shooting, the officer who responded says his injuries are "nothing major."</p>
<p>In the case of the woman, her lawyer says officer body camera footage from the incident contradicts that narrative, too. On Thursday, a grand jury indicted her and another man, alleging that they "impeded, intimidated and interfered" with the duties of a federal officer.</p> <p>"What we're seeing is a general escalation of violence and the use of excessive force by ICE officers," says Ed Yohnka, director of communications and public policy at the ACLU of Illinois, which has brought a lawsuit against the Trump administration for violating the constitutional rights of protesters.</p> <p>In Covington's statement to NPR, she said ICE officers are "highly trained and act accordingly with law and policy." The statement also cited a sharp increase in assaults against ICE officers, though reporting from Colorado Public Radio suggests those claims are overblown.</p> <p>Gil Kerlikowske, the former commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection during the Obama administration, says federal immigration officers are not prepared for what is being asked of them.</p> <p>"They do not have the training or skillset or experience to police an urban environment," says Kerlikowske, who was also the police chief in Seattle and police commissioner in Buffalo, N.Y.</p> <p>Good policing in cities, he says, relies on de-escalation, trust and public cooperation. The show of force federal agents are using in Chicago and elsewhere is unnecessary, he says.</p> <p>"These are tactics and strategies that are clearly not needed to be able to do their job," Kerlikowske says. "I couldn't be more disappointed."</p> <p>Courts have weighed in on the amount of force a police officer — whether they're local, state or federal — can legally use, and determined that any use-of-force must be "objectively reasonable."</p> <p>"What does it mean to be objectively reasonable? That term by itself doesn't actually mean anything without context," says Seth Stoughton, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who trains police officers.</p>
<p>DHS, which includes ICE, uses that standard. The agency's most recent use-of-force policy notes that officers should only use force when "no reasonably effective, safe and feasible alternative appears to exist." Among the agency's principles are "de-escalation" and "respect for human life."</p> <p>For use of force to be constitutional, there must be a valid threat. But threats can range from someone with a gun, to someone resisting arrest, to many scenarios in between. How police respond to a situation also must be proportional to the danger of the situation.</p> <p>"We look at the situation through the lens of the reasonable officer on the scene," adds Stoughton. "It might be perfectly reasonable for an officer to step in front of someone, raise a hand and say, 'Stop. I need to talk to you.' And it would be totally unreasonable for the officer to put a gun in that person's face and say, 'Stop or I'm going to shoot you.'"</p> <p>Many uses of force can be legally justified, but Stoughton says just because officers can do something doesn't mean they should.</p> <p>"I don't think most people are asking the question, is this action in this particular video consistent or inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment?" Stoughton says, referring to the law that governs searches and seizures, which also protects against excessive force. "I think what they're asking is, is this a socially and democratically legitimate police action? And that's a very different question than whether it's a legal police action."</p> <p>Immigrant rights groups in Chicago, including the ACLU of Illinois, say federal agents are violating the law – by using "violent force" against protesters and others.</p> <p>Because of that, they say it's important for bystanders to document what they witness, which helps make questions of force a little less open for interpretation.</p>

<p>BEITUNIA, West Bank — Cheers erupted among Palestinians on Monday as Israel released nearly 2,000 prisoners under a Gaza ceasefire agreement that saw them exchanged for Israeli hostages freed by Hamas.</p> <p>Large crowds greeted the freed prisoners in Beitunia in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Khan Younis in Gaza, flashing V-for-victory signs as they descended from International Committee of the Red Cross buses. In Beitunia, they were given traditional keffiyeh scarves as a show of nationalist pride. Some were lifted onto people's shoulders. Others sank into chairs, exhausted.</p>
<p>"It was an indescribable journey of suffering — hunger, unfair treatment, oppression, torture and curses — more than anything you could imagine," said Kamal Abu Shanab, a 51-year-old Fatah member from the West Bank town of Tulkarem.</p> <p>His face was gaunt. He said he lost 139 pounds (59 kilograms) in prison.</p> <p>"We don't recognize him. He's not the person we knew. Our uncle doesn't look like our uncle," said his niece, Farah Abu Shanab.</p> <p>Those freed include around 1,700 of the several thousand Palestinians that Israeli troops seized from Gaza during the 2-year war and have held without charge.</p> <p>Also among those released were 250 Palestinians sentenced to prison terms, most of them convicted for deadly attacks on Israelis dating back decades as well as others convicted on lesser charges, according to Israel's Justice Ministry. Of those, Israel exiled 154, sending them to neighboring Egypt, where officials said they will be sent to third countries.</p> <p>The rest were returning to homes in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>A profound moment</strong></h3> <p>The releases have powerful resonance on both sides.</p> <p>For Israelis, they're deeply painful, since some of those released were convicted over attacks that killed civilians and soldiers. For Palestinians, the issue of prisoners is politically charged. Nearly everyone has a friend or family member who has been jailed by Israel, particularly young men.</p>
<p>While Israel views the prisoners as terrorists, many Palestinians consider them as freedom fighters resisting a decades-long Israeli military occupation. Reports from rights groups detailing conditions while held — including isolation, abuse and illness — have made prisoners prominent symbols of their people's political struggle.</p> <p>In Khan Younis, thousands of people cheered and celebratory gunfire rang in the air. The freed Palestinians filed out wearing gray jumpsuits and entered the hospital for medical examinations.</p> <p>Israeli forces detained thousands of Palestinians during the war in raids on shelters and hospitals and at checkpoints stopping families as they fled their homes amid military operations.</p>
<p>Families often had no idea their relatives had been detained, and it often took months to determine if they were in Israeli custody, if confirmation came at all. Most were held under laws passed in Israel at the start of the war that allowed Palestinians to be detained for months as "unlawful combatants" without judicial review or access to lawyers.</p> <p>Rights groups, the U.N. and detainees have reported routine abuse in the detention facilities, including beatings and insufficient food.</p> <p>Israel says it adheres to its prison standards under law and investigates any reports of violations.</p> <p>Monday's release still leaves about 1,300 Palestinians from Gaza in Israeli custody, according to a count of detainees in September by the Israeli human rights group Hamoked.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>Warnings not to celebrate</strong></h3> <p>Celebrations in the West Bank occurred despite Israeli warnings against doing so. A flier circulated saying anyone supporting what it called "terrorist organizations" risked arrest.</p> <p>Palestinians had gathered on hills overlooking Ofer Prison. An armored Israeli vehicle drove up and fired tear gas and rubber bullets. As drones buzzed overhead, the crowd scattered.</p> <p>Israel's military did not respond to questions.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Who is on the list</strong></h3> <p>According to a list issued by Hamas, the Gaza detainees freed include two women, six teenagers under 18 and around 30 men over 60.</p>
<p>The list of 250 convicted prisoners freed, ranging in age from 19 to 64, includes 159 affiliated with Fatah, the political party that runs the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and 63 associated with Hamas. The remainder are unaffiliated or belong to other groups.</p> <p>Many were arrested in the early 2000s, which saw the eruption of the Second Intifada, a Palestinian uprising fueled by anger over continued Israeli occupation despite years of peace talks. Palestinian armed groups carried out attacks that killed hundreds of Israelis, and the Israeli military killed several thousand Palestinians.</p> <p>Some were convicted in military trials that rights advocates say often lack due process. Others have been incarcerated for months or years without trial in what is known as administrative detention. Israel says the practice, widely criticized by Palestinians and human rights groups, is needed to prevent attacks and avoid sharing sensitive intelligence.</p>
<p>The Hamas list did not include roughly half a dozen highest-profile prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti, Hassan Salameh, Ahmed Saadat and Abbas Al-Sayyed. Barghouti is widely seen as a potential successor to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.</p> <p>A list of released prisoners issued by Israel includes the following:</p> <p><strong>Raed Sheikh</strong><br/>A 51-year-old Palestinian police officer and Fatah member, Sheikh was sentenced to multiple life terms in 2000 for his role in the killing of two Israeli soldiers who were attacked by a mob at a West Bank police station, including one thrown from the station's window.</p> <p><strong>Mahmoud Issa</strong><br/>A 57-year-old Hamas commander imprisoned for life in 1993 — before the Oslo interim peace accords — Issa was among those convicted of kidnapping and killing a 29-year-old Israeli border police officer that year. Much of his more than three decades behind bars were spent in solitary confinement, conditions that have made him a symbol among prisoners' rights advocates.</p>
<p><strong>Shamasneh brothers</strong><br/>The two brothers — 56-year-old Mohammed and 62-year-old Abdel Jawad Shamasneh — were in 1993 sentenced to multiple life terms for their role in a stabbing attack that killed Israeli hitchhikers whose bodies were later found in a Jerusalem riverbed in 1990 during the first Palestinian intifada.</p> <p><strong>Iyad Fatafta</strong><br/>A 47-year-old Fatah member serving a life sentence, Fatafta was one of two men convicted of murder for stabbing American tourist Kristine Luken and a friend who was hiking with her and survived.</p>

<div class="article-title">Kids who use social media score lower on reading and memory tests, a study shows</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Preteens using increasing amounts of social media perform poorer in reading, vocabulary and memory tests in early adolescence compared with those who use no or little social media. </p> <p>That's according to a new study that suggests a link between social media use and poorer cognition in teens. The findings are published in <em>JAMA</em>.</p> <p>"This is a really exciting study," says psychologist Mitch Prinstein at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who wasn't involved in the new research.</p>
<p>"It confirms a lot of what we have been hearing about from schools all across the country, which is that kids are just having a really hard time focusing on being able to learn as well as they used to, because of the ways in which social media has changed their ability to process information, perhaps."</p> <p>While most previous research has focused on the impact of social media use on kids' mental health, "it's critical to understand how social media use during school hours specifically affects learning, especially as so many schools are considering phone bans right now," says study author and pediatrician Jason Nagata of the University of California, San Francisco.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A look at reading and memory </h3> <p>To understand that, Nagata and his colleagues used data from one of the largest ongoing studies on adolescents, called the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Scientists have been following thousands of preteens as they go through adolescence to understand the development of their brains.</p>
<p>The ongoing study has been surveying kids about their social media use every year and giving them a range of tests for learning and memory every other year. Nagata and his colleagues used data on over 6,000 children, ages 9 to 10, as scientists followed them through early adolescence.</p> <p>They classified the kids into three groups based on their evolving patterns of social media use. The biggest group, consisting of about 58% of the kids, used little or no social media over the next few years. The second-largest group, about 37% of kids, started out with low-level use of social media, but by the time they turned 13, they were spending about an hour each day on social media. </p>
<p>The remaining 6% of kids — called the "high increasing social media group" — were spending about three or more hours a day by age 13.</p> <h3 class="edTag">"The dosage effect"</h3> <p>All the groups were given a range of tests to measure their cognitive functioning at the start of the study and in early adolescence. For example, the oral reading recognition test examined their reading and vocabulary skills. Another test, called the picture vocabulary test, had them match the right pictures to words they heard.</p> <p>"What was notable actually to me and perhaps surprising was that even the low [increasing] social media users, so those who had about one hour a day by age 13, did perform on average 1 to 2 points lower on the reading and memory tasks compared to the non-social media users," says Nagata.</p> <p>And the high increasing group performed up to 4 to 5 points lower than the non-social media users.</p> <p>"So those who had the highest social media use have lower scores," notes Nagata, "but even the low users had smaller differences in their cognitive scores."</p> <p>"That really speaks to the dosage effect of these [apps]," says psychologist Sheri Madigan at the University of Calgary, who wrote an accompanying editorial for the study. "It's problematic at really high uses, but it's also problematic at even in small doses."</p> <p>While a difference of a few points in test scores may seem insignificant, "it's important to understand that kids are a moving target," explains Prinstein, who is also chief of psychology strategy and integration at the American Psychological Association.</p> <p>"Even a slight change in what they look like after a short period of time means that they're kind of now pointed on a trajectory that is different from others. That means that two, three, five years from now, we might be talking about some very significant gaps between kids who might have been heavy users or not as heavy users."</p>
<p>And other recent research shows that hours on social media increase later in adolescence, notes Nagata. "We would expect that when they hit age 15, 16, 17, their use will be much higher," which might lead to even larger gaps in cognition and learning in later years, he adds.</p> <p>In earlier studies, Nagata's team has used the same data from the ABCD Study and found other disturbing trends among underage social media users.</p> <p>They found that a majority of kids — nearly two-thirds — start using social media before they turn 13, with the average user having three social media accounts.</p> <p>They also found high levels of addiction-like symptoms with smartphones among 10-to-14-year-olds.</p> <p>"Half the kids who had smartphones said that they lose track of how much time they're using their phone," says Nagata. "A quarter who are using social media say they use social media to forget about their problems. And 11% say that social media use has negatively affected their schoolwork."</p> <h3 class="edTag">An important time for brain development</h3> <p>Adolescence is a critical period for brain development, notes Prinstein, when the brain is fine-tuning its architecture based on experiences.</p> <p>"After the first year of life, the adolescent period is the time where we see the most growth and the biggest reorganization of the brain in our lifetimes," he says.</p> <p>In a recent study, Prinstein and his colleagues found that teens who are heavy social media users have brains that are more attuned to an existence on social media, with its "rapid, constant feedback," says Prinstein. "What we're finding is that kids become hypersensitive to the kinds of likes, comments, feedback and rewards they might get from peers."</p> <p>Those findings help explain the results of the new studies, he adds. "It makes perfect sense that if their brain is growing to be optimized for social media activities, it might not be optimized for other things they need to do, like we saw in the [new] study."</p>
<p>The new study also "gives us good-enough evidence that we really need to create some policies that are really specific around creating age limits, for example, on social media apps," says Madigan.</p> <p>Denmark announced last week that it plans to enforce a social media ban for users under age 15, she notes. Australia is requiring social media companies to "take reasonable steps to prevent Australians under the age of 16 from creating or keeping an account" starting December 2025.</p> <p>Madigan hopes other countries will take note. "I think that we'll see a trickle effect on that. That's going to be really beneficial for kids."</p>
