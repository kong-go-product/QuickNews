<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New York Yankees radio voice Suzyn Waldman has once again landed in the crosshairs of a WFAN personality. </p><p>Boomer Esiason's former radio co-host Craig Carton used to routinely take jabs at Waldman, and this week the former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback appeared to renew the rivalry.</p><p>Esiason's ribbing comes after a recent lighthearted back-and-forth between Waldman and Dave Sims, the play-by-play voice of the Bronx Bombers. The 2025 season marks the first time Waldman and Sims have worked alongside one another in the Yankees broadcast booth.</p><p>The exchanges prompted WFAN morning host Gregg Giannotti to question whether Waldman harbored some level of jealousy over any endorsement deals Sims had landed.</p><p>As part of one of Sims' latest deals, the host shared a promotional post for Dude Wipes. Esiason took notice of the ad and jokingly floated a theory about Waldman.</p><p>"She could use like, uh, Vagisil daily fresh wipes," Esiason said. "I couldn’t even say that with a straight face. I couldn’t. I mean, there’s all sorts of feminine wipes."</p><p>Fox News Digital contacted WFAN's parent company, Audacy, for comment but did not immediately receive a response. Waldman's reps could not be reached.</p><p>This isn't the first time this season Esiason has made headlines for comments related to the Yankees broadcast booth.</p><p>Esiason also poked fun at Sims after the broadcaster missed a workday during the early portion of the 2025 season.</p><p>Carton frequently used a long-running — and what many viewed as unflattering — impression of Waldman during his time on the radio station's morning program. </p><p>Waldman was able to put differences aside for the 2024 Yankees season when she worked alongside Carton.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Toronto Blue Jays won Game 4 of the ALDS 5-2 on Wednesday night, eliminating the Yankees from postseason contention. </p><p>It marks the first time Toronto has advanced to the ALCS since 2016.</p><p> sports coverage on X the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">World leaders praise 'landmark' Israel-Hamas peace deal mediated by US: 'New horizon of hope'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump announced in an exclusive interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Wednesday night that a "landmark peace deal" between Israel and Hamas has been reached, hailing it as "a historic step toward peace in the Middle East."</p><p>In the interview, Trump said "the whole world came together" to make the deal happen, crediting both "luck" and "talent." </p><p>"So many countries that you wouldn’t have thought of have come together," he said on "Hannity." "It’s been so great for Israel, so great for Muslims, for the Arab countries — and so great for the United States of America. This is more than Gaza — this is peace in the Middle East."</p><p>Leaders across the world are welcoming the news and describing it as a potential turning point.</p><p>"With the approval of the first phase of the plan, all our hostages will be brought home. This is a diplomatic success and a national and moral victory for the State of Israel," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. "From the beginning, I made it clear: we will not rest until all our hostages return and all our goals are achieved." </p><p>He thanked his "great friend and ally President Trump," saying Israel has "reached this critical turning point."</p><p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog chimed in on X, offering an emphatic endorsement of the deal while thanking Trump, adding that "should he visit us in the coming days, he will be received with immense respect, affection, and gratitude by the people of Israel."</p><p>"This agreement will bring moments of indescribable relief to the dear families who have not slept for 733 days. This agreement offers a chance to mend, to heal, and to open a new horizon of hope for our region," the post read. "This is a time to honor the heroes among us: our sons and daughters who fought bravely to bring the hostages home; the bereaved families; the wounded in body and spirit; and all who have paid an unbearable price for this historic and vital moment." </p><p>At the United Nations, Secretary-General António Guterres welcomed the breakthrough and urged swift follow-through, according to Reuters.</p><p>"I welcome the announcement of an agreement to secure a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza. The United Nations will support full implementation and recovery efforts. This momentous opportunity must not be lost," Guterres said.</p><p>Under the deal, Hamas is expected to release all 20 living hostages by this weekend, and the Israeli military is expected to begin withdrawing troops from most of Gaza as part of the initial phase.</p><p>The IDF also released a statement on social media, welcoming "the signing of the agreement for the return of the hostages, which was signed overnight."</p><p>"This is a great day for peace," Trump said. "Many years they talked about peace in the Middle East — now it’s happening."</p><p>The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry says more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, a figure that has not been independently verified.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Eight people linked to a Houston-area midwife accused of allegedly performing illegal abortions have been arrested and indicted for practicing medicine without a license, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced Wednesday.</p><p>In a statement shared online, Paxton described the group as "a cabal of abortion-loving radicals" who "endangered the very people they pretended to help."</p><p>The arrests are the latest development in an investigation into Maria Margarita Rojas, 49,who earlier in 2025 became the first to be charged under the Texas Human Life Protection Act.</p><p>Rojas faces 15 felony counts, including three for performing an abortion and 12 for practicing medicine without a license. Her case is ongoing.</p><p>Paxton said the eight new defendants were working under Rojas at her clinics in Waller, Cypress, Spring, and Katy. </p><p>Those charged were identified as Yaimara Hernandez Alvarez, Alina Valeron Leon, Dalia Coromoto Yanez, Yhonder Lebrun Acosta, Liunet Grandales Estrada, Gerardo Otero Aguero, Sabiel Bosch Gongora, and Jose Manuel Cendan Ley. </p><p>In his statement, Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, said the arrests show his commitment to enforcing the state’s strict abortion laws and said, "beyond being illegal, it is evil." </p><p>"These dens of fake doctors will not be allowed to operate in Texas," Paxton added. </p><p>"Those responsible will be held accountable. I will always protect innocent life and use every tool to enforce Texas’s pro-life laws," he said.</p><p>The Center for Reproductive Rights called the case against Rojas a "sham." The organization is representing Rojas in a separate civil lawsuit.</p><p>Jenna Hudson, Senior Counsel, told Fox News Digital that the indictments were "an escalation of Texas' scare campaign against doctors and healthcare workers."</p><p>Hudson said Paxton "went after Rojas, a licensed midwife dedicated to helping her pregnant patients."</p><p>"He heartlessly shut down several clinics that provided lawful, affordable services to families around Houston, most of whom were low-income, uninsured immigrants with few options for health care, " she added.</p><p>"It’s no coincidence that he is targeting Rojas and these clinics amid the widespread anti-immigrant sentiment nationwide. Texas health care workers deserve respect, not to be treated like criminals."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Blue Jays take Game 4 over Yankees to secure first ALCS trip since 2016</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Toronto Blue Jays are heading to the American League Championship Series (ALCS) after defeating the New York Yankees, 5-2, in Game 4 of the ALDS, Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium.</p><p>It marks the first time the Blue Jays have reached the ALCS since 2016, and they will face the winner of Game 5 between the Seattle Mariners and Detroit Tigers in their ALDS series. </p><p>After a come-from-behind victory for the Yankees in Game 3 to stay alive in the series, momentum was certainly on the side of the home team in the Bronx entering Game 4. That was especially the case with Cam Schlittler, the darling rookie of the Wild Card round who shut down the Boston Red Sox to help his squad move on in the postseason. </p><p>But much like they have all series, the Blue Jays scratched and clawed their way to runs, and it was Vladimir Guerrero Jr. getting the job done once more in the first inning. With George Springer hitting a leadoff double to open the game, Guerrero served a single to right field to get Toronto on the board first. </p><p>Blue Jays manager John Schneider was working a bullpen game, meaning he would pick and choose the right matchups with his relievers. He went with Louis Varland, who gave up the game-tying three-run homer to Aaron Judge on Tuesday night, as well as the eventual game-winning solo shot to Jazz Chisholm Jr., to start the game. </p><p>Varland did his job, but Mason Fluharty allowed the Yankees to tie the game when Ryan McMahon, the No. 9 hitter, turned on an offspeed pitch and sent it over the short porch in right field to make it 1-1. </p><p>In the top of the fifth inning, Toronto saw its eight and nine hitters, Ernie Clement and Andres Gimenez, giving their team an opportunity after they both hit singles to set up runners at the corners with nobody out. Springer hit a sacrifice fly to retake the lead, though the Blue Jays couldn’t get more there. </p><p>It was still too close for comfort for the Blue Jays, as the Yankees were knocking at the door in the bottom of the sixth inning with runners on first and second – the first time they had runners in scoring position all night. But Chisholm grounded out to second base to end the threat of tying, or even better for the home team, taking the lead. </p><p>Then, the most pivotal moment came in the top of the seventh inning when Clement once again singled to get on base. Gimenez hit a sharp liner in the next at-bat, but it appeared to be an inning-ending double-play ball as it was going right to Chisholm. But Chisholm couldn’t handle it and there were runners now on second and third with one out. </p><p>Devin Williams came into the game, relieving Schlitter after he went 6.1 innings for his squad. He got Springer to strike out, a massive swing-and-miss, as the Yankees were close to getting away from a potentially fatal mistake. </p><p>But Nathan Lukes, the 31-year-old high-contact guy, slapped a single to center field, scoring Clement and Gimenez to make it a 4-1 game. Though only three runs, it felt like more considering the Yankees weren’t able to get runners on base consistently like they were in Game 3. </p><p>The Blue Jays would add one more in the top of the eighth inning thanks to Myles Straw connecting on a single to right field to score Alejandro Kirk, but it was always going to be the rest of Toronto’s bullpen that would really shut this game down. </p><p>The Yankees threatened with runners in the bottom of the seventh and eighth innings, but the Blue Jays were able to head back into the dugout unscathed. The biggest pitch was Jeff Hoffman, Toronto's closer, working out of a bases-loaded jam after Austin Wells flew out to left field. </p><p>Hoffman got the final three outs needed to start the celebration, as the Yankees and their fan base were left stunned with their season complete. </p><p>The Blue Jays finished the game with 12 total hits to the Yankees' five, and they used eight different pitchers to get the job done. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A video obtained by Politico and released Wednesday shows California Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter berating a staffer during a 2021 video call after stepping into her shot.</p><p>In the clip, then-U.S. Rep. Porter, D-Calif., is seen speaking with Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm about energy and climate issues. At one point, a staffer walks into the frame, prompting Porter to snap and yell, "Get out of my f---ing shot!"</p><p>She also scolded the staffer for having appeared in the background before.</p><p>"You were in my shot before that," Porter said. "Stay out of my shot."</p><p>Politico noted that Porter’s outburst was edited out of the Department of Energy’s final version of the webinar.</p><p>The Porter campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. </p><p>The resurfaced footage follows another viral clip this week showing Porter lashing out at a reporter and attempting to end an interview.</p><p>During a segment on California’s redistricting effort, CBS California reporter Julie Watts asked Porter, "What do you say to the 40% of California voters who you’ll need in order to win, who voted for Trump?"</p><p>Porter, considered by many to be the frontrunner in the race, responded, "How would I need them in order to win, ma’am?"</p><p>"Well, unless you think you’re going to get 60% of the vote," Watts said, prompting Porter to laugh.</p><p>The exchange grew tense as Porter pushed back on the question, arguing over whether she needs to court Trump voters, particularly if she’s running head-to-head against another Democrat.</p><p>"So you don’t need them to win," Watts asked Porter.</p><p>"I feel like this is unnecessarily argumentative," Porter said, prompting the reporter to point out that she had asked the same question to the other candidates in the race, and they answered it.</p><p>"I don’t want to keep doing this, I’m going to call it," Porter said.</p><p>"You’re not going to do the interview?" Watts said as Porter tried to remove her microphone.</p><p>"Nope, not like this I’m not, not with seven follow-ups to every single question you ask," Porter responded.</p><p>When Watts reminded Porter that every candidate had answered the question, Porter said, "I don’t care."</p><p>Porter told Watts after being pressed even more that she doesn’t "want to have an unhappy experience with you" and that she doesn’t "want this all on camera."</p><p>The clip drew widespread attention online, with conservatives criticizing Porter for struggling with follow-up questions.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Final faceoff: Democrat, Republican nominees in key race for governor blast each other on debate stage</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> With under one month to go until Election Day in New Jersey's competitive and combustible race for governor, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli battled over Sherrill's military record, Ciattarelli's business career, and support for President Donald Trump during their second and final debate.</p><p>The showdown in New Jersey in the race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, which turned increasingly bitter in recent weeks, played out at Wednesday's acrimonious debate.</p><p>In one heated exchange, Sherrill accused Ciattarelli of profiting off the opioid crisis, claiming that he "killed tens of thousands of people" through his ties to pharmaceutical industry-backed training materials.</p><p>And Ciattarelli fired back that Sherrill "broke the law," as he pointed to a fine she paid four years ago for failing to timely disclose stock trades, as members of Congress are required to do under federal conflict-of-interest law.</p><p>New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states to hold gubernatorial contests the year after a presidential election, which means the races traditionally grab outsized national attention.</p><p>And this year's ballot box showdowns are viewed as crucial early tests of Trump's popularity and second-term agenda, and are considered key barometers ahead of next year's midterm elections for the U.S. House and Senate.</p><p>The two candidates took shots at each other over key issues, including New Jersey's sky-high energy costs, property taxes, immigration, and the ongoing federal government shutdown.</p><p>And while he isn't on the ballot, Trump loomed large over the debate.</p><p>Ciattarelli, who cruised to the GOP nomination earlier this year after landing Trump's endorsement, was asked where he disagrees with the president.</p><p>"I disagree with the president on the Empire Wind Farm for Long Island," the Republican nominee answered.</p><p>Moments later, Sherrill charged that her GOP rival had "shown zero signs of standing up to this president. In fact, the president himself called Jack 100% MAGA, and he's shown every sign of being that."</p><p>Ciattarelli shot back that "in times of need, it's best to have a relationship with whoever occupies the White House, and I will."</p><p>Asked to grade the president's performance so far during his second term, Ciattarelli said, "I'd certainly give the president an A. I think he's right about everything that he's doing."</p><p>"I think that tells us all we need to know about who Jack Ciattarelli's supporting. I give him an F right now," Sherrill responded, as she pointed to New Jersey's high cost of living.</p><p>Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker and a certified public accountant who started a medical publishing company before getting into politics and winning election as a state lawmaker, is making his third straight run for New Jersey governor. And four years ago, he grabbed national attention as he came close to upsetting Murphy.</p><p>It was during the 2021 campaign that Ciattarelli's connection to opioid manufacturers first surfaced. Ciattarelli sold his company, which published content promoting the use of opioids as a low-risk treatment for chronic pain, in 2017.</p><p>"You’re trying to divert from the fact you killed tens of thousands of people by printing your misinformation, your propaganda," Sherrill charged. "I think our kids deserve better. I think the people you got addicted and died deserve better than you."</p><p>Ciattarelli responded, saying, "With regard to everything she just said about my professional career, which provided for my family, it's a lie. I'm proud of my career."</p><p>"Shame on you," Ciattarelli added.</p><p>Sherrill shot back, "Shame on you, sir."</p><p>Cittarrelli then blamed the fentanyl crisis on former President Joe Biden's "open border" policies.</p><p>And at a post-debate news conference, he claimed the attack by Sherrill was "a desperate tactic by a desperate campaign on behalf of a desperate candidate."</p><p>Sherrill, asked after the debate if she had proof directly linking Ciattarelli to the opioid deaths, told reporters, "I guess he’s not really expressed anything about this. I think there’s a lot we don’t know. I think he continues to not be very transparent about it."</p><p>Ciattarelli, during the debate, fired back at Sherrill, saying, "I got to walk at my college graduation," as he referred to the controversy surrounding Sherrill's military records.</p><p>The race was rocked two weeks ago after a New Jersey Globe report revealed that Sherrill's military records indicated that the United States Naval Academy blocked her from taking part in her 1994 graduation amid the cheating scandal.</p><p>Sherrill has claimed that Ciattarelli was going on a "witch hunt" over her improperly released military records, which raised questions about her possible involvement in a cheating scandal that rocked the U.S. Naval Academy three decades ago.</p><p>Ciattarelli and his campaign have repeatedly called on Sherrill, who went on to pilot helicopters during her military career after graduating from the Naval Academy, to release her military records to explain why she was prevented from attending her graduation ceremony.</p><p>But a separate report from CBS News revealed that the National Personnel Records Center, which is a branch of the National Archives and Records Administration, mistakenly released Sherrill's improperly redacted military personnel files, which included private information like her Social Security number, to a Ciattarelli ally. </p><p>The National Archives, in a letter two weeks ago, apologized to Sherrill, saying the improper release was due to a government worker's error over a legal records request.</p><p>Following the breach of the records, Sherrill's campaign sent cease-and-desist letters to the National Archives and to Ciattarelli's campaign, as well as to Russell and Nicholas De Gregorio, who is described by Sherrill’s team as "an agent of the campaign working at the direction of" Russell.</p><p>The Sherrill campaign also launched a digital ad taking aim at Ciattarelli.</p><p>"They broke the law to attack a veteran," the narrator in the spot charged.</p><p>Sherrill, asked why she didn't attend her graduation, said at the debate, "I didn't turn in some of my classmates, so I didn't walk at graduation because I come from an incredibly accountable place. But I went on to graduate. I was commissioned an officer in the United States Navy."</p><p>And she reiterated that she does not want to give Ciattarelli and his campaign access to the records of her Naval Academy classmates.</p><p>And she asked, "Why my opponent still won't take accountability for the release of those records. It's under federal investigation that a member of his team, someone he vetted to be his lieutenant governor, actually got access to those records, said he was shocked and disgusted, and yet nevertheless shopped them out to reporters when he was asked about it, he acted as if he had no idea what his campaign was doing."</p><p>"So either he's really incompetent or he's lying," she argued.</p><p>Ciattarelli quickly responded, calling on Sherrill to release her records.</p><p>"We know for a fact that she wasn't allowed to participate in the graduation ceremony. We know for a fact that her name was not listed in the commencement exercise program. She says it's because she didn't turn in classmates. That's the honor code at West Point. That's not the honor code at the Naval Academy. You don't get punished for that. I think she was punished for something else," he argued.</p><p>While Democrats have long dominated federal and state legislative elections in blue-leaning New Jersey, Republicans are very competitive in gubernatorial contests, winning five out of the past ten elections.</p><p>And in the 2025 race, political history favors both parties. </p><p>The party that wins the White House tends to lose the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial elections the following year, which favors the Democrats. But Democrats in New Jersey are also trying to buck history — it's been over six decades since a party won three straight Garden State gubernatorial elections.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump credited "luck" and "talent" for playing a role in getting a peace deal between Israel and Hamas after months of deadlock.</p><p>"The whole world came together, to be honest. So many countries that you wouldn't have even thought of, they came together. The world has come together around this deal," he said Wednesday in an exclusive interview on "Hannity" after announcing a deal that could see the end of the two-year-long war in the Middle East.</p><p>Trump added that the remaining hostages could be released as early as Monday. </p><p>Nearly 50 hostages remain in Gaza — 20 of whom are believed to be alive — according to figures compiled by Fox News.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on X that he would convene his government Thursday to formally approve the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage-release deal.</p><p>Trump thanked Qatar, Egypt and Turkey for helping mediate the agreement, part of his 20-point peace plan.</p><p>The announcement came after U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner arrived in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Wednesday to join negotiations to end the two-year-old war and free the remaining hostages. </p><p>"So many countries that you wouldn't have thought of have wired their best wishes and their commitment to do whatever is necessary," Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity.</p><p>"The countries surrounding have all signed. I mean, they're all signed up and — it's been really an amazing period of time and so great for Israel, so great for Muslims, for the Arab countries, and so great for this country, for the United States of America, and that we could be involved in, you know, making a deal like this happen because it was, you know — many years they talked about peace in the Middle East. This is more than Gaza, this is peace in the Middle East and it's an incredible thing."</p><p>Sources told The Associated Press that Hamas plans to release all 20 living hostages this weekend and the Israeli military will begin withdrawing from most of Gaza.</p><p>The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which has advocated for the release of all hostages since the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in southern Israel, welcomed the news of the agreement. </p><p>"The Israeli government must convene immediately to approve the agreement. Any delay could exact a heavy toll on the hostages and soldiers," the group wrote on X. "There are 48 hostages held by Hamas. Our moral and national obligation is to bring them all home — both the living and the deceased. Their return is essential to the healing and recovery of Israeli society as a whole. We will not rest until the last hostage comes home."</p><p>Israel marked two years since the deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust Tuesday amid global isolation and mounting pressure to end its ongoing war against Hamas. </p><p>The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health — which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants — says more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed in the two-year war, according to Reuters.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump suggested CBS has "hope" under a "great new owner" during a White House roundtable discussion on Wednesday. </p><p>Trump hosted what was called an "Antifa Roundtable" with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and several right-leaning and independent media journalists. The journalists discussed their first-hand experience dealing with the radical left-wing group, which Trump recently designated a domestic terror organization.</p><p>During the discussion, the journalists also criticized mainstream media outlets for either ignoring stories about Antifa or inaccurately reporting events, such as CNN’s "fiery but mostly peaceful protests" chyron from the 2020 riots.</p><p>Trump agreed with their criticism, going so far as to accuse Antifa of working "in conjunction" with some parts of the media. He went on to attack more media networks, though he expressed optimism for CBS.</p><p>"I think ABC is very bad," Trump said. "I think NBC is very bad. And CBS has a new owner, so we have hope for CBS. CBS has a great new owner [in] my opinion. But, as I will tell you, ABC is terrible. NBC is terrible. MSNBC too. You know, they changed it. They moved it over legally, so they couldn’t be tainted by the words 'MSNBC,' but they are absolutely terrible there, a lot of them."</p><p>Trump is likely referring to the recent merger between Paramount Global, CBS’ parent company, and Skydance Media in August. Both companies are now under Skydance CEO David Ellison, who has made CBS News one of his top new priorities.</p><p>One of the major changes under Ellison included appointing Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief of CBS News after Paramount acquired her media company, The Free Press. Weiss will partner with current CBS News President Tom Cibrowski and report directly to Ellison.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to CBS and Paramount for comment.</p><p>During the roundtable discussion, Trump asked some of the journalists which of the networks they felt were the worst offenders. He agreed with one who ranked MSNBC as the worst, followed by CNN.</p><p>"MSNBC. Brian Roberts, that he allows it to happen is a disgrace. And CNN is second. I would say CNN is not quite as bad as MSNBC. MSNBC is sick," Trump said.</p></body></div></body></html>

Glenn Youngkin’s immigration enforcement policies making Virginia a "sanctuary state," according to the Republican Governors Association. </p><p>This policy would prevent local law enforcement from assisting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in cases like Mejia’s, where ICE has issued a detainer for an undocumented immigrant convicted of serious crimes.</p><p>Virginia GOP governor candidate, Winsome Earle-Sears reacted by sharing a post on X and said she was "sickened beyond words." </p><p>Meija, 35, was convicted of multiple counts of raping a child under 13, indecent liberties with a minor, and statutory burglary after pleading guilty in Virginia Beach Circuit Court, according to documents seen by Fox News Digital.</p><p>The assaults happened in 2024, when Mejia was hired to renovate a family’s bathroom.</p><p>The abuse came to light when the victim’s mother discovered him in her daughter’s bed after forcing open a locked door with a butter knife. </p><p>Mejia fled the home through a window, but was later identified and arrested.</p><p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed Mejia was in the country illegally and has issued a detainer. </p><p>Following his sentence at the Virginia Department of Corrections, ICE said he will be transferred to custody for further proceedings.</p><p>During his sentencing, Mejia apologized to the victim, saying, "I know I am not the only one experiencing hard times.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Democratic lawmaker Katie Porter's disastrous viral interview was shredded by journalists across the political spectrum, who ranged from being astounded at her hostility to being unsurprised because of her reputation.</p><p>A clip of Porter threatening to walk out on CBS California's Julie Watts during a interview on the controversial redistricting effort launched by Democrats in the state spread like wildfire online Tuesday night. The interview itself took place last month.</p><p>Porter, who is running in for California governor, snapped at Watts' questions, grew visibly impatient with her follow-ups and even attempted to leave at one point in frustration, calling her interviewer "argumentative." Porter told Watts after being pressed that she doesn't "want to have an unhappy experience" with her and that she doesn't "want this all on camera."</p><p>"This will be a case study in political media trainings for how not to conduct yourself on camera," CNN senior political reporter Aaron Blake wrote.</p><p>"Someone who used to work with Katie Porter sent me this clip from a train-wreck interview with her and said, 'Now imagine what she’s like when there aren’t cameras around,'" journalist Yashar Ali commented.</p><p>"You can see the unpleasant experiences so many Dem operatives and journalists have had with former Rep. / CA-GOV candidate Katie Porter (D) pouring out, now that video of her abusive personality has leaked out. Worst kept secret in politics," Jewish Insider's Josh Kraushaar wrote.</p><p>"Democrats are so used to media being their propagandists that they totally lose it when asked basic question," OutKick's Clay Travis posted.</p><p>"The knock on Porter has always been that she’s cruel to staff and others around her. The defense was that that charge is sexist and she’s just tough. Watch to the end and you judge who’s right," liberal journalist Ryan Grim wrote on X.</p><p>"Hard to watch Katie Porter without thinking she's doing some kind of Colbert Report-style parody of a narcisstic, [sic] yet self-loathing liberal mediocrity with a startling intolerance for anything other than heavy-handed praise," Mediaite's Isaac Schorr wrote.</p><p>Democratic strategist Dan Turrentine, a frequent critic of his own party, was withering about Porter's performance on a 2Way podcast appearance.</p><p>"She is condescending and patronizing," he said. "She absolutely believes that she is right, you are wrong, she's smarter than you. It comes across… She doesn't respect Trump voters, and she didn't respect those type of questions. You just can't talk to people like that. And that is Katie Porter's problem. It's why so many people dislike her — and disliked her in Congress."</p><p>Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., argued that Porter represents a larger problem within the Democratic Party itself.</p><p>"Katie Porter just had a meltdown when asked what she’d say to GOP voters. Her tirade is a window into the mentality of radical CA Democrat politicians," he wrote. "They can’t stand those who disagree with them. They’re trying to silence their opponents with Prop 50. They even condone violent rhetoric targeting Republicans. We have to speak up. We have to vote NO on Prop 50. We have to take our state back from these extremists."</p><p>Watts herself posted on X that people should watch the entire 30-minute segment on YouTube, where she interviewed multiple candidates for governor on a range of topics, including Proposition 50 and California’s battle over redistricting.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Porter's campaign for comment.</p><p>In 2024, Porter ran for an open Senate seat in California but lost to colleague then-Rep.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Bill Belichick’s time at North Carolina might already be coming to a close. </p><p>UNC has reportedly had "potential exit strategy discussions" on Tuesday, per 247 Sports. This comes as Belichick’s Tar Heels are 2-3 through their first five games of his inaugural season as a college head coach. </p><p>North Carolina has reportedly had "preliminary conversations" about firing Belichick, which would be a whopping $20 million buyout as part of his contract. However, 247 Sports points out that an alleged rules violation could help the program either eliminate or reduce the buyout. </p><p>While the university is having the conversation, Belichick is reportedly thinking about it as well. </p><p>Belichick has "discussed buyout options with North Carolina’s hierarchy," where he has "signaled a willingness to trigger his own $1 million buyout if he can find a soft landing with another team or in media," according to college football journalist Ollie Connolly.</p><p>These rumors come as UNC is in the midst of its bye week, and it’s certainly not the way Belichick or anyone envisioned his jump into college football after his illustrious NFL coaching career. </p><p>But while the product on the field hasn’t been great, there’s been some drama off it as well. Cornerbacks coach Armond Hawkins was suspended for allegedly giving extra benefits to players, which includes sideline passes for family members. </p><p>There was also a lawsuit filed in North Carolina that alleges the university board hired Belichick illegally. </p><p>And now, things have gotten so bad for the Tar Heels that the Hulu docuseries that was to follow around Belichick through his college football journey was reportedly scrapped due to the poor start. The project had only been announced in August, but the plug has been pulled.</p><p>Belichick’s latest loss was a blowout at the hands of Clemson at home, 38-10, where the Tigers put up 28 points in the first quarter and coasted to victory from there. They owned a 35-3 lead at halftime, which ultimately led Dabo Swinney to pull some starters down the stretch. </p><p>With reported dysfunction in Belichick’s program, there is also his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, whose presence was criticized before he even made his debut in a 48-10 blowout loss to TCU. </p><p>Hudson has been regularly seen on the sideline before games, speaking with Belichick and even ACC commissioner Jim Phillips this past week. </p><p>For now, Belichick will use the bye week to gear up for the Tar Heels’ next game against the California Golden Bears on Oct. 17. But perhaps his days as the leader in Chapel Hill could be coming to an end. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

"While there, President Trump will stop by for his routine yearly checkup. He will then return to the White House."</p><p>Trump, 79, is also considering "going to the Middle East shortly thereafter," Leavitt added. The possible visit would come after Hamas agreed to the first phase of Trump's peace deal to end the war in Gaza and return the hostages.</p><p>The medical checkup will be Trump’s second this year. He had a similar exam in April, during which his physician stated that he "remains in excellent health."</p><p>"President Trump remains in excellent health, exhibiting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function," Navy Capt. Sean P. Barbabella, the physician to the president, said at the time.</p><p>However, in July, the president was diagnosed with a vein condition known as chronic venous insufficiency.

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The suspect behind last week’s deadly car and knife terror attack outside a synagogue in Manchester allegedly pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, authorities said.</p><p>Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian descent, allegedly called emergency dispatchers to claim responsibility for the attack before pledging allegiance to the Islamic State.</p><p>"We have conducted assessments across our systems, and I can reiterate that Al-Shamie had never been referred to the Prevent program, nor was otherwise known to Counter Terrorism Policing," Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said Wednesday. </p><p>The Prevent program is a U.K. government initiative aimed at offering individuals who are susceptible to radicalization proper interventions to stop them from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism.</p><p>Head of Counter Terrorism Policing Laurence Taylor said on Oct. 3 that while Al-Shamie was not known to the counterterrorism team, he was on bail at the time of the attack after being arrested on suspicion of rape.</p><p>Potts said that police are now "more confident that he was influenced by extreme Islamist ideology, the 999 call forms part of this assessment."</p><p>While Potts pointed to the call as evidence of Al-Shamie’s motivation, he stressed that authorities needed to look across all evidence gathered to determine the motive behind the attack.</p><p>"This assessment continues, and there may be further drivers and motivations identified," Potts added.</p><p>Al-Shamie was shot by police outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue after the attack in which he rammed a car into pedestrians before attacking them with a knife. The attacker was wearing what appeared to be an explosive device, but Potts called it a "hoax device" and said it was later assessed and confirmed to be "non-viable."</p><p>Two congregants, identified as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, died in the attack, which took place on Yom Kippur, Judaism’s holiest day. </p><p>Police later said that it was likely one of the two victims was accidentally shot by officers who were rushing to stop the attack, as Al-Shamie did not have a gun on him. Reports indicate Daulby was the one shot.</p><p>Potts informed reporters on Wednesday that three people injured during the attack are still hospitalized.</p><p>While investigating whether Al-Shamie acted alone, police arrested three men and three women on suspicion of the "commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism," The Associated Press reported. </p><p>The people arrested have not been identified and police have not revealed their ties, if any, to Al-Shamie.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio handed him a note indicating the United States is "very close to a deal in the Middle East," a revelation he made Wednesday at the White House during a roundtable on Antifa.</p><p>"Yeah, I was just given a note by the Secretary of State saying that we're very close to a deal in the Middle East, and they'll get to need me, pretty quickly," Trump said.</p><p>Nearly two hours later, Trump posted on Truth Social that a deal had been struck.</p><p>"I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first Phase of our Peace Plan," he said. "This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace."</p><p>"All Parties will be treated fairly!" Trump added. "This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America, and we thank the mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, who worked with us to make this Historic and Unprecedented Event happen. BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!"</p><p>Israeli TV Channel 12 reported the agreement will be signed at noon local time on Thursday, and the release of hostages and prisoners will take place Saturday.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also weighed in, saying, "With God’s help we will bring them all home."</p><p>Trump said earlier Wednesday he might travel to the Middle East as Gaza peace negotiations continued.

<div class="article-title">500 National Guard troops deployed in Chicago area amid legal battle</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Approximately 500 National Guard soldiers from Texas and Illinois have been deployed in the Chicago area and mobilized to protect federal agents and facilities amid a legal battle over their deployment.</p><p>According to the U.S. Northern Command at the Department of Defense, approximately <span class="link">200 soldiers from the Texas National Guard</span> and 300 soldiers from the Illinois National Guard have been "employed in the greater Chicago area." Their mobilization will last for a period of at least 60 days. </p><p>"These forces will protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other U.S. government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property," Northern Command said in a statement. </p><p>The troops have been stationed at the U.S. Army Reserve Center in southwest suburban Elwood, where new fencing has been installed since the Texas guard members first arrived on Tuesday. Crews also have installed privacy screens along the interior of the existing fence line.</p><p>Several trailers have been set up at the facility as temporary living quarters. Several soldiers were seen moving in with bags of belongings on Tuesday; some holding rifles and carrying folding chairs, possibly for meetings or other trainings. </p>
<p>Northern Command said as part of their duties to protect federal agents and facilities, the troops would be assigned to establish security perimeters, perform crowd control, and use de-escalation tactics. While soldiers would be allowed to temporarily detain people to prevent an assault or interference with federal agents, Northern Command said they will not be arresting protesters.</p><p>There were a handful of demonstrations outside the facility on Wednesday; a couple to protest against the arrival of Texas guard members, and a couple more to support them.</p><p>Illinois state leaders said they only got word late Monday night that the 200 Texas National Guard troops would be stationed at the Elwood base starting Tuesday.</p><p>Retired U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Richard Hayes was the highest-ranking member of the Illinois National Guard. In his 30-plus-year career, he said he's never seen a National Guard from a different state federalized and then sent to another state.    </p>
<p>"This is novel. It doesn't mean it's necessarily illegal, it's just different," he said. "As far as the soldiers are concerned, the Illinois National Guard, even the Texas National Guard, they don't get a say in whether they go or not go. It's not a political organization, they're just here to do what they're being asked to do."</p><p>There has been little movement in or out of the training facility since the troops arrived, and CBS News Chicago legal analyst Irv Miller said he's not surprised.</p><p>It remains in question whether the troops will be sent out on protection details, since the state of Illinois and city of Chicago have filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard. Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson have argued there is no crisis requiring the troops' presence in the Chicago area.</p><p>Federal judge April Perry scheduled a hearing for Thursday for arguments on a request for a temporary restraining order blocking the troop deployment. Perry declined to immediately issue that restraining order on Monday when the lawsuit was filed to give the federal government time to file briefs, which it did, minutes before the 11:59 p.m. CDT Wednesday deadline she set.</p><p>In the 59-page filing, the government argued that President Trump has the legal authority to deploy the troops and that state objections should not block the operation. The federal attorneys also argued that courts should be "highly deferential" when reviewing a president's judgment in such matters in light of the authority they say the executive branch is given by the Constitution and statutes. </p><p>Miller said it's likely leaders are waiting for the judge's decision before making any moves.</p><p>"Oh, absolutely. I mean, the judge didn't explicitly state that they couldn't come into the city, but I think if you read between the lines as to what she was saying, that it probably would be a good idea if everybody waited until she made the decision on Thursday to decide what they're going to actually do," Miller said.</p>
<p>Miller said he expects the judge to grant the temporary restraining order prohibiting the deployment for now, but any decision will likely be appealed to a higher court.</p><p>A federal judge in Oregon <span class="link">has blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Portland</span>. That judge has ruled the relatively small protests outside Portland's immigration processing facility didn't justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.</p><p>Since that ruling, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek has called on U.S. Northern Command to demobilize the 200 Oregon National Guard troops and 200 California National Guard troops that the Trump administration had mobilized for Portland.</p><p>Mr. Trump has suggested, regardless of what happens in court, he might invoke the Insurrection Act "if it was necessary" to deploy troops to Portland and Chicago.</p><p>"If people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure I'd do that. I mean, I want to make sure that people aren't killed," he said earlier this week.</p><p>U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin said the president invoking the Insurrection Act to justify a troop deployment "would be terrible."</p><p>"It would be illegal and unconstitutional, because there is no basis in law for his invasion with these troops from Texas into the state of Illinois. He is not making life any better for our state, and he's not making it any safer," Durbin said.</p>

<div class="article-title">What the candidates for California governor are saying about redistricting, immigration and other top issues</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>CBS News California Investigates correspondent Julie Watts sat for in-depth interviews with the candidates running to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom when he terms out in 2026.</p><p>In this ongoing series, candidates are pressed to go beyond campaign talking points to provide direct answers on a range of topics important to voters, such as Proposition 50 and congressional redistricting, immigration, homelessness, gas prices, affordable housing, insurance and more.</p><p>Candidates in the race for California governor include Democrats Xavier Becerra, Ian Calderon, Stephen J. Cloobeck, Katie Porter, Tony Thurmond, Antonio Villaraigosa and Betty Yee; Republicans Chad Bianco, Steve Hilton and Leo Zacky; and Green Party candidate Butch Ware. Initially, we also interviewed former California State Senate President Pro Tem  Toni Atkins, but she has since dropped out of the race.</p><h2>Where the candidates for California governor stand on redistricting, Proposition 50  </h2><p>In the first installment of this series, the remaining 11 gubernatorial candidates share where they stand on redistricting and Proposition 50, the ballot measure backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom that, if approved by voters in a Nov. 4 special election, would authorize California lawmakers to redraw the state's congressional districts. The effort, which is aimed at sending more Democrats to Congress, is meant to counter Texas' recent redistricting push that favors Republicans and was backed by President Trump.</p><p>While most Democratic candidates supported the plan and Republicans criticized it, the interviews uncovered points of tension, with former Orange County Rep. Katie Porter threatening to call off the interview over follow-up questions. She ultimately stayed and continued answering questions.</p>
<p>In upcoming installments of the series, the candidates will share their views on topics including crime, gas prices, immigration, homelessness and more in California.</p><h2>Candidates share one thing Newsom and the state Legislature did wrong and right</h2><p>In our "One Question" series, we offer voters a brief introduction to each candidate by asking: "What do you think our current governor and legislature did right, and what would you have done differently?" You can find the full YouTube playlist with each video here and links to each candidate's response below.</p><h2>Xavier Becerra</h2><p>Xavier Becerra is a former California attorney general who served as Health and Human Services secretary in the Biden administration. Becerra said he credits Newsom for strengthening the state's economy. On what he'd do differently, Becerra said he would have acted more quickly than Newsom on issues like California's high-speed rail project and the statewide housing crisis. Watch here.</p><h2>Chad Bianco</h2><p>Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said he could only praise Newsom for "acting like a Republican" in what he says is the governor's bid for the presidency. Bianco then said that he couldn't think of a single thing the state Legislature has done right during his seven years as sheriff. Watch here.  </p>
<h2>Ian Calderon</h2><p>Calderon, former state Assembly majority leader, praised Newsom for his efforts to address California's housing crisis and the legislature for focusing on addressing online safety for children. Calderon said he does believe the State of California has "lost the plot," meaning that state leaders should focus more on California issues rather than what's going on in Washington, D.C. Watch here.  </p><h2>Stephen J. Cloobeck</h2><p>Cloobeck, a business executive, said what he believes Newsom has done well as governor is be active in the public and communities. On why he's in the gubernatorial race, Cloobeck said he's "sick and tired" of the Trump administration "making us look silly." Watch here.  </p><h2>Steve Hilton</h2><p>Public policy expert Steve Hilton said the thing he most agrees with Newsom on is limiting smartphone use in schools. If elected, Hilton said he would work to improve California's rising housing costs, which he said he believes is the top reason why residents are leaving the state. Watch here.</p><h2>Katie Porter</h2><p>Consumer protection attorney and law professor Katie Porter praised Newsom for making school lunches free through the governor's universal meals program. Porter said, if she were governor, she would work to bring down housing costs statewide. Watch here.  </p><h2>Tony Thurmond</h2><p>California's Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond lauded Gov. Newsom for being a creative thinker and for investments in public education. If elected, Thurmond said he would prioritize addressing California's insurance crisis and creating more affordable housing. Watch here.  </p><h2>Antonio Villaraigosa</h2><p>Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa criticized Newsom's decision to keep kids out of schools for as long as he did during the pandemic. He said two things Newsom and the legislature got right were health care and child care. Watch here.  </p><h2>Butch Ware</h2><p>University of California professor Butch Ware criticized Newsom's response to immigration raids and the homeless crisis. Ware also disagreed with Newsom's use of social media to challenge the Trump administration, but appreciated the governor's effort to fight back. Watch here.  </p>
<h2>Betty Yee</h2><p>Former State Controller Betty Yee commended Newsom's ability to be present and accessible during key issues and emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. Yee said, if elected, she would focus on improving California's fiscal accountability. Watch here.</p><h2>Leo Zacky</h2><p>Business owner Leo Zacky said he's running to "bring common sense solutions to save my home state." Zacky said he couldn't think of one thing the governor or the state Legislature has done well while Newsom has been in office. Zacky specifically criticized raising California's minimum wage for fast food workers. Watch here.</p><h2>2025 California Educational Gubernatorial Forum</h2><p>On September 8, Watts moderated the nonpartisan 2025 California Educational Gubernatorial Forum, which featured many of the candidates vying to be the next governor, including Becerra, Porter, Thurmond, Villaraigosa, Yee, Hilton and Zacky. The event was hosted by Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs (APAPA) and California State University, Sacramento.</p><h2>Subscribe and follow</h2><p>Subscribe to our CBS News California YouTube channels and follow us on social media to hear from each candidate on the issues that matter most to you.  </p><p>Julie Watts, CBS News California Investigates: @JulieWattsTV Instagram, TikTok, YouTube</p><p>CBS News Sacramento: @CBSSacramento Instagram, TikTok, YouTube</p><p>CBS News San Francisco: @KPIXTV Instagram, TikTok, YouTube</p>

<html><body><div><article class="content content-article lazyload" data-index="0" data-path="/news/tropical-storm-priscilla-forms-pacific-maps-mexico/" id="article-0">
<section class="content__body">
<p>Priscilla weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm off Mexico's Pacific coast, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said Wednesday, but there was still the risk that it could bring flooding to the southwestern U.S. later this week and into the weekend. </p><p>After developing over the weekend, Priscilla was bringing high surf conditions and gusty winds to Mexico's Baja California Sur, according to the hurricane center. A tropical storm watch was in effect for Baja California Sur from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro.</p><p>Portions of central and northern Arizona, southern Utah, southwest Colorado and far northwest New Mexico could see up to 4 inches of rain from Priscilla between Thursday and Saturday afternoon, the hurricane center said, which includes scattered flash flooding. </p><p>As of Wednesday night, Priscilla had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, the hurricane center said, and was moving northwest at 9 mph. A Category 1 hurricane has sustained winds of at least 74 mph.</p>
<h2>Tropical Storm Priscilla's track and forecast</h2><p>The center of Priscilla was forecast to continue moving parallel to the coast of Baja California Sur through Thursday, while still offshore, the hurricane center said. Forecasters noted that the storm should continue to weaken over the next 48 hours and it should become a remnant low by Friday, which is a type of post-tropical cyclone.</p>
<p>Priscilla was approximately 235 miles west of the southern tip of Baja California, according to the hurricane center.  </p>
<p>The center warned of large swells generated by Priscilla, which were affecting parts of the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico on Wednesday, in addition to southern parts of the Baja California peninsula.</p><p>"These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition to coastal flooding," forecasters said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Tropical Storm Jerry churns over central Atlantic Ocean</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Tropical Storm Jerry continued to churn early Wednesday over tropical waters of the central Atlantic Ocean, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said, a day after it formed. </p><p>The new system, the 10th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, was far from land. The hurricane center said Jerry was some 505 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands, the Caribbean chain east of Puerto Rico that starts with the Virgin Islands and extends down to Guadeloupe. </p><p>Jerry had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph as it moved west-northwest at 18 mph across the open ocean, according to forecasters. Forecasters said it was expected to strengthen and could become a hurricane late this week or over the weekend, meaning it would have minimum sustained winds of at least 74 mph.</p><p>A tropical storm watch was in effect for Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, St. Kitts, Nevis, and Montserrat, St. Barthelemy, St. Martin, Saba and St. Eustatius, Guadeloupe and the islands adjacent to it.</p>
<h2>Maps show Jerry's path</h2><p>Jerry's core is forecast to be near or north of the northern Leeward Islands late Thursday and Thursday night, the hurricane center said. It wasn't <span class="link">posing any threat to southern Florida</span>.</p>
<p>"On Thursday into early Friday, two-to-four inches of rain are expected across the Leeward Islands due to Jerry," the center said. "This rainfall brings a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain."</p>
<p>The center also noted that swells generated by Jerry were forecast to reach the Leeward and Windward Islands on Thursday, before spreading toward the Greater Antilles.</p><p>"These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions," it said.</p>
<h2>Hurricanes this season</h2><p>Jerry developed on the heels of several Atlantic storms, including <span class="link">Hurricane Humberto</span> and <span class="link">Hurricane Imelda</span>, which emerged at the end of September. Concerns that both could strike Bermuda briefly circulated, but only Imelda ultimately brushed the coast of the island as a Category 2 hurricane before quickly weakening on its way out to the open ocean.</p>
<p>Humberto and Imelda also hit the southeastern United States with destructive surf, causing multiple coastal homes in North Carolina's Outer Banks <span class="link">to collapse</span>.</p><p>This has been a relatively <span class="link">quiet hurricane season</span>, which typically runs annually from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. While Jerry is the 10th named storm this year, just one of the nine others — <span class="link">Chantal</span> — actually made landfall in the U.S. </p><p>When the current season began, <span class="link">an outlook</span> released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration indicated that between 13 and 19 named storms would form in the Atlantic, with up to nine becoming hurricanes and as many as five strengthening into powerful Category 5 storms. But, as the months progressed, <span class="link">NOAA revised its outlook</span> in August to predict that 13 to 18 named storms would form, including five to nine hurricanes.</p>

<div class="article-title">Colombian president alleges U.S. bombed boat from his country; White House denies</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The president of Colombia alleged Wednesday that a boat <span class="link">struck by the U.S. military</span> in the Caribbean Sea last week carried Colombian citizens, a claim a White House official called "baseless and reprehensible."</p><p>The U.S. military has hit at least four alleged drug boats since last month, with the most recent known strike on Oct. 3 killing four "narco-terrorists" in a vessel off the coast of Venezuela, according to <span class="link">Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth</span>. The Trump administration argues the attacks are necessary to halt drug trafficking, but <span class="link">critics say</span> the administration lacks legal approval to carry out the strikes.</p><p>On Wednesday, Colombian President Gustavo Petro wrote on X: "Indications show that the last bombed boat was Colombian with Colombian citizens inside it." </p><p>Petro did not specify the source of his information or why he believes the people on the boat were Colombian citizens, though he said he hopes their families come forward. The U.S. military has not publicly identified the boat's passengers.</p><p>The White House quickly denounced Petro's statement. A White House official told CBS News the U.S. "looks forward to President Petro publicly retracting his baseless and reprehensible statement so that we can return to a productive dialogue on building a strong, prosperous future for the people of [the] United States and Colombia."</p>
<p>The White House official also described Colombia as an important U.S. partner despite "policy differences with the current government."</p><p>The<span class="link"> first leftist elected president</span> of Colombia in decades, Petro has periodically clashed with the Trump administration. He denounced the strikes on alleged drug boats in a speech before the United Nations last month, and days later, he encouraged members of the U.S. military to "disobey" Mr. Trump's orders during a New York protest — leading the State Department to announce<span class="link"> it would revoke his visa</span>. Meanwhile, the U.S. has accused his government of not cooperating on anti-drug trafficking efforts.</p><p>Petro's most recent allegation adds to mounting scrutiny of the Trump administration's campaign of strikes against alleged drug-carrying vessels in the Caribbean.</p><p>President Trump <span class="link">has cast the strikes</span> as part of a broader gambit to combat drug smuggling and stem the flow of deadly narcotics into the U.S. His administration has designated several cartels and Latin American gangs as terrorist organizations, and since August, several U.S. Navy vessels have been stationed in the Caribbean as part of an <span class="link">anti-cartel mission</span> — drawing stiff backlash from the Venezuelan government.</p>
<p>"Every one of those boats is responsible for the death of 25,000 American people and the destruction of families," Mr. Trump said in a speech in Virginia marking the Navy's 250th anniversary over the weekend. "So when you think of it that way, what we're doing is actually an act of kindness."</p><p>In a notice to Congress <span class="link">obtained by CBS News</span>, the Trump administration described the passengers on one alleged drug boat as "unlawful combatants" — the term that President George W. Bush's administration used to describe members of al Qaeda — and argued that the U.S. is in a "non-international armed conflict" with the cartels.</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Wednesday the attacks are "targeted strikes against imminent threats against the United States," and the president does not need permission from Congress to carry them out.</p><p>But critics — including some members of Congress — have argued Mr. Trump is acting without legal authority, and have pushed the administration to provide evidence that the boats were carrying drugs or that the passengers were guilty of anything. Congress has not authorized the use of military force against drug cartels.</p><p>On Wednesday, Senate Democrats <span class="link">forced a vote on a resolution</span> that sought to block further strikes. The measure failed 48-51, but it picked up support from Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a longstanding skeptic of military force.</p><p>"If anyone gave a you-know-what about justice, perhaps those in charge of deciding whom to kill might let us know their names, present proof of their guilt, show evidence of their crimes," Paul said. "Is it too much to ask to know the names of those we kill before we kill them? To know what evidence exists of their guilt? At the very least, the government should explain how the gang came to be labeled as terrorists."</p>

<div class="article-title">Senate votes down war powers resolution aimed at blocking Trump's boat strikes</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington</em> — Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked an effort aimed at preventing continued U.S. strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats off the coast of Venezuela. </p><p>Democrats forced a vote on the issue under the War Powers Act. In a 48-51 vote, the effort failed to garner enough support to move forward. </p><p>The resolution, led by Sens. Adam Schiff of California and Tim Kaine of Virginia, would have blocked the U.S. military from engaging in hostilities with "any non-state organization engaged in the promotion, trafficking, and distribution of illegal drugs and other related activities" without congressional authorization. </p><p>"There has been no authorization to use force by Congress in this way," Schiff said Wednesday, saying the strikes risk escalating into a full-blown conflict with Venezuela. "I feel it is plainly unconstitutional." </p><p>The strikes in the Caribbean Sea have prompted bipartisan backlash, with lawmakers questioning their legality. Congress, which has the sole authority under the Constitution to declare war, has not authorized the use of military force against drug cartels.</p>
<p>The Trump administration says it has conducted four strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats near Venezuela since Sept. 2, killing at least 21 people.</p><p>In <span class="link">a notification</span> to Congress after the second strike in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an "armed attack" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House. </p><p>The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13. </p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was at the Capitol on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans, told reporters the president has the authority to order the strikes without congressional authorization. </p>
<p>"These are targeted strikes against imminent threats against the United States," he said. </p><p>Regarding claims that the U.S. is acting in self-defense, David Janovsky, the acting director of The Constitution Project, said, "The situation in the Caribbean is not that."</p><p>Democrats' war powers resolution said the designation of drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations "provides no legal authority for the president to use force against members of designated organizations or any foreign state."   </p><p>Kaine said the administration has not provided answers to lawmakers' questions on the intelligence supporting the strikes, the legal rationale for them or why the decision was made to attack the boats instead of intercept them. </p><p>"The White House does not maintain there's any congressional authorization," Kaine said. "These military actions should stop unless authorized by Congress — not stopped, period, permanently, forever, can't-do-them stopped — unless authorized by congressional action." </p><p>Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. If Congress does not authorize military force, the president has to withdraw forces within 90 days. The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.</p><p>Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has been the loudest GOP critic of the strikes on the alleged drug smuggling boats. After the first strike, Paul condemned Vice President JD Vance, who said "killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military." </p>
<p>"What a despicable and thoughtless sentiment it is to glorify killing someone without a trial," Paul wrote.  </p><p>Paul underscored his point in a floor speech Wednesday, saying the strikes risk killing innocent people and the administration has presented no evidence that the boats were carrying drugs. </p><p>"If anyone gave a you-know-what about justice, perhaps those in charge of deciding whom to kill might let us know their names, present proof of their guilt, show evidence of their crimes," Paul said. "Is it too much to ask to know the names of those we kill before we kill them? To know what evidence exists of their guilt? At the very least, the government should explain how the gang came to be labeled as terrorists." </p><p>Paul added, "the blow-them-to-smithereens crowd also conveniently ignores the fact that death is generally not the penalty for drug smuggling." </p><p>During debate on the resolution, other Republicans were untroubled about the president taking unilateral action against the alleged drug traffickers and that the administration has left Congress in the dark on details of the strikes. </p><p>"These strikes were fully compliant and fully justified," Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho said. </p><p>There were similar efforts by Congress over the summer to reassert its authority to declare war as tensions boiled over between Israel and Iran. The U.S. became directly involved in the 12-day war by bombing Iran's nuclear facilities before Iran and Israel agreed to a ceasefire.</p>
<p>After the Iran strikes, the Senate <span class="link">voted down</span> a measure that Kaine had introduced in the days before the bombings to block President Trump from using further military force against Iran. </p><p>"The Iran situation was extremely time-limited," Janovsky said. "The administration has made it very clear that they continue, and have in fact continued, to carry out these strikes in the Caribbean. So I think that certainly creates more ongoing urgency for Congress to act in some way in this case." </p><p>Schiff said Congress has abdicated its war-declaring responsibilities because members don't want to go on the record on the issue. He said that sets a dangerous precedent. </p><p>"We're blowing up ships thousands of miles from our shore," Schiff said. "What is to stop some other nation from deciding, well, they're going to use the same precedent to blow up ships thousands of miles from their shore, whether in the South China Sea or elsewhere, with a purported rationale that they're engaged in some kind of trafficking and therefore they're taking action? I don't think this is a practice we want to see other nations adopt." </p>

<div class="article-title">Israel and Hamas reach deal to release all hostages, Trump says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Israel and Hamas have struck a deal for Hamas to release all remaining hostages and for Israel to withdraw its forces to an "agreed upon line," President Trump announced Wednesday, in what he called the "first Phase" of a peace deal <span class="link">to end the two-year-long war</span>. </p><p>"This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America," the president wrote on Truth Social. "BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!"</p><p>Two regional sources told CBS News there is an agreement on all sides in principle on a hostage release, but procedural issues remain. Once those details are handled, it will be 48 hours before any release starts, sources said. </p><p>Mr. Trump, in an interview Wednesday night with Fox News host Sean Hannity, said that hostages would "probably" be released on Monday, and the exchange would include the release of the bodies of deceased hostages still being held by Hamas.</p><p>"Hostages are going to be released. It's, probably, our time, would be probably Monday," Mr. Trump told Hannity. "... And that'll include the bodies of the dead."</p>
<p>A senior White House official previously told CBS News that the hostages could be released on Monday. The deal will go to Israel's cabinet for approval on Thursday, and if it votes yes, the Israeli military will need to withdraw to an agreed-upon line in the Gaza Strip, which should take under 24 hours. Then Hamas will have 72 hours to release the hostages, the official said. </p><p>Mr. Trump suggested to Hannity that other parts of the Israel-Hamas <span class="link">peace plan he laid out last week</span> — including a committee to oversee governance in Gaza — could be forthcoming. </p><p>"I think you're going to see people getting along, and you'll see Gaza being rebuilt," the president said. "People are going to be taken care of. It's going to be a different world."</p><p>Majed al-Ansari, an adviser to Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, also confirmed the deal on Wednesday, writing on X that an agreement was reached on "the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid."</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also released a short statement on the hostages that read, "With God's help we will bring them all home."  </p><p>In a follow-up statement, Netanyahu said it was a "big day for Israel" and that he would "convene the government to approve the agreement and bring all our dear hostages home." Netanyahu and Mr. Trump spoke Wednesday, which the Israeli government described as a "very emotional and warm conversation."</p><p>Hamas also confirmed in a statement it had reached an agreement.</p><p>The terrorist group praised Qatari, Egyptian and Turkish mediators in helping broker a deal, and specifically thanked Mr. Trump for his "efforts." It also called on the president to ensure that Israel "fully complies with the terms of the agreement."</p><p>In his earlier Truth Social post, Mr. Trump wrote: "All Parties will be treated fairly!" </p><p>The announcement came just hours after Mr. Trump <span class="link">said he may travel to the Middle East</span> this weekend, and was open to potentially traveling to the Gaza Strip. </p><p>During an unrelated event at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump read a note that was passed to him by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The president said Rubio's note said negotiators were "pretty close to a deal," and that they would "need him" pretty quickly. </p>
<p>A little over a week ago, Mr. Trump unveiled a <span class="link">20-point peace plan</span> at a White House meeting with Netanyahu, who expressed his full support for the proposal. </p><p>The current round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 6 in Egypt, with Egyptian and Qatari officials acting as intermediaries. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, had been expected to join the talks on Wednesday, days after Netanyahu confirmed he had sent a delegation "to close the technical details of the release of our hostages."</p><p>The war in Gaza, which has roiled the Middle East, was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel. That attack killed some 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza.</p><p>Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza against Hamas, which the U.S. and Israel consider a terrorist organization, has killed more than 67,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant casualties.</p><p>Of the 251 hostages who were taken into Gaza, 148 were either freed as part of previous ceasefire agreements or <span class="link">rescued by Israeli forces</span>, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The bodies of another 57 hostages were returned or recovered, the ministry says.</p><p>Mr. Trump's peace plan had called for Hamas to release all 48 remaining hostages. Israel believes 20 of them are still alive. In return, Israel would release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, along with approximately 1,700 other Gazans detained since the start of the war.</p><p>Hamas said on Oct. 4 it agreed to key portions of Mr. Trump's original proposal — including the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and relinquishing its governance of Gaza. But the group had said other parts of the plan needed to be further negotiated.</p>

<div class="article-title">Escaped New Orleans inmate Derrick Groves captured after standoff in Atlanta, police say</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The last of 10 inmates who <span class="link">escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center</span> in May was captured on Wednesday in southwest Atlanta after a brief standoff, according to the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office.</p><p>Derrick Groves' arrest marks the end of a months-long, multi-agency manhunt that began after he and nine other inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish facility on May 16, 2025.</p><p>Groves was taken into custody at a home on Honeysuckle Lane following a coordinated operation involving Crimestoppers Greater New Orleans, the U.S. Marshals Service, the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations, Louisiana State Police, the New Orleans Police Department, the Atlanta Police Department, and other agencies.</p><p>Officials with the U.S. Marshals Office in Louisiana <span class="link">told CBS News' Nicole Sganga</span> that they had received a tip through Crime Stoppers that pointed them to metro Atlanta. The nonprofit organization received several hundred tips on Groves over the past months, and they were all vetted, President of Crime Stoppers of the Greater New Orleans area Darlene Cusanza said at a news conference Wednesday.</p><p>After a SWAT team deployed a number of gas canisters, law enforcement agencies found Groves in the crawl space of the home, a spokesperson for the Atlanta Police Department said. He was the only one in the home at the time and was taken into custody without incident.</p>
<p>In video provided by the Atlanta Police Department, Groves is seen smiling and blowing a kiss as officers put him in the back of a patrol vehicle.</p><p>"I guess they're taking me to jail," Groves said during his arrest, the Atlanta Police Department confirmed.</p>
<p>Investigators have not said how long Groves has been at the home or his relationship with the owner of the property. Authorities are working to learn how he got to Atlanta after his escape.</p><p>Records from the Fulton County Jail show that Groves was booked on fugitive from justice charges on Wednesday. He is expected to be extradited to Louisiana at a later date.</p>
<h2>Louisiana officials react to Derrick Groves' arrest</h2><p>"Groves' escape represented a serious breach of public safety and a historic failure of custodial security. His capture brings long-awaited calm to victims, their families, the witnesses who testified, the assistant district attorneys who prosecuted him, and the people of New Orleans who were rightly concerned that a convicted violent offender had escaped so easily and evaded justice for so long," New Orleans District Attorney Jason Rogers Williams said in a statement. "We will pursue every available legal avenue to ensure that Derrick Groves answers for every crime he has committed and every consequence he has sought to avoid."</p><p>Williams added that the collaboration among local, state, and federal authorities was key to locating Groves and safely bringing him into custody. </p><p>At a news conference on Wednesday night, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said Groves is expected to be prosecuted for the jailbreak in Georgia, and possibly by federal prosecutors. Groves was expected to be sentenced to life in prison for his previous convictions and he will likely face additional time.</p><p>"This has been extraordinary taxing," Murrill said. "It's been expensive. It has been scary for a lot of people, for staff at the DA's office, for victims and witnesses who might have been involved or have implicated Derrick Groves."</p>
<h2>New Orleans jailbreak </h2><p>On May 16, Groves and nine other men broke out of the Orleans Justice Center by fleeing through a hole behind a toilet, prompting an elaborate nationwide manhunt. Within 24 hours, three escapees were tracked down and captured by law enforcement, while several others were taken back into custody within a few weeks. </p><p>In July,  Dkenan Dennis, Gary Price, Robert Moody, Kendell Myles, Corey Boyd, Lenton VanBuren, Jermaine Donald, Antoine Massey, and Leo Tate pleaded not guilty to charges of simple escape.</p><p><span class="link">Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson told CBS News</span> in an exclusive interview earlier this year that prison staffing and design flaws played a major role in the breakout.   </p>
<p>Sheriff Hutson said the Orleans Parish Justice Center jail, built in 2015, was poorly constructed from the start.  </p><p>"There are major design flaws in it that make it unsafe for those who are housed here and make it unsafe for those who work here," Hutson said. "And I included the locks and other mechanisms that I don't want to talk about on camera that are safety issues. But we talked about this, and we alerted everybody in the system." </p><p>Darriana Burton, a former employee at the jail who allegedly was involved in a relationship with Groves during his incarceration, is accused of helping him coordinate the escape.  Authorities believe Burton arranged phone calls that avoided the jail's monitoring system. She is one of at least 16 people, including many family members of the escapees, who are facing charges for providing transport, food, shelter, and cash to the fugitives.</p><h2>Who is Derrick Groves? </h2><p>According to court records, Groves, who goes by "Woo," dropped out of school in ninth grade and sold heroin in New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward for years. The FBI began monitoring his social media while he was still a teenager, and Groves pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking charges in 2019.</p><p>Groves has been in jail since at least 2019, after his involvement in four killings over 18 months.</p><p>In October 2024, a jury convicted Groves of second-degree murder for using an assault rifle to fire dozens of bullets into a family block party on Mardi Gras. </p><p>Byron Jackson, 21, and 26-year-old Jamar Robinson were killed, and several others were wounded. He faces life imprisonment without parole, but administrative delays have kept him in jail for years instead of a more secure prison facility.</p>
<p>Groves later pleaded guilty to manslaughter charges in two separate shootings, according to the Orleans Parish District Attorney's office. He was scheduled to be sentenced in December 2024 but a judge in the case recused herself, and Groves still had not been sentenced when he escaped, according to Murrill.</p><p>In a follow-up statement Wednesday night, Murrill called Groves "the most violent of all the inmates who escaped the Orleans Justice Center back in May, with at least four bodies to his name. He will spend the rest of his life in the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. Anyone who may have helped him will also be arrested and prosecuted. A lot of people will sleep much better tonight knowing this convicted murderer is finally back in custody."    </p>

<div class="article-title">New DoD credential restrictions send "message of intimidation," press corps says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Pentagon press corps' negotiations with the Defense Department over easing proposed restrictions on their reporting have reached an impasse, according to the Pentagon Press Association — though the Pentagon says it has negotiated in good faith.</p><p>In a statement Wednesday, the Association said it "has been cautious" with its public statements about the restrictions as negotiations were underway over revising the new rules, which reporters are required to sign off on or else lose their Pentagon press credentials.</p><p>"Unfortunately, those negotiations have not been as successful as we had hoped," said the Association, which represents reporters who cover the Pentagon.</p><p>In September, the Defense Department sent reporters a memo saying that they'd be required to sign a document acknowledging they would not disclose either classified or controlled unclassified information that is not formally authorized for publication. It warned Pentagon reporters they could lose their press credentials for "unauthorized access, attempted unauthorized access, or unauthorized disclosure" of classified information or anything designated as "controlled unclassified information."</p><p>The memo also said, "DoW information must be approved before public release … even if it is unclassified." The Trump administration <span class="link">has sought to rename</span> the Defense Department to the Department of War, though a permanent renaming could require congressional approval.</p>
<p>Currently, news organizations, including CBS News, are assigned workspaces and credentials that allow journalists limited access in the Pentagon.</p><p>Compliance with the directive would mean that journalists would not be able to use unnamed U.S. military sources in much of their reporting without risking loss of access to the Pentagon.</p><p>Many media outlets balked at the directive and vowed to push back. The New York Times said in a statement the restrictions were "at stark odds with the constitutional protections of a free press in a democracy."</p><p>Over the course of negotiations over the restrictions, the Pentagon dropped a requirement for reporters "to express agreement with the new policy as a condition for obtaining press credentials," the Association's statement said. But it went on to say that "the Pentagon is still asking us to affirm in writing our 'understanding' of policies that appear designed to stifle a free press and potentially expose us to prosecution for simply doing our jobs."</p>
<p>The Association said that the new credentialing policy "still leaves open the threat of the Department of Defense revoking credentials for reporters who exercise their First Amendment rights by seeking information that hasn't been pre-approved for formal release, even when the information is entirely unclassified." </p><p>"The policy conveys an unprecedented message of intimidation to everyone within the DoD, warning against any unapproved interactions with the press and even suggesting it's criminal to speak without express permission — which plainly, it is not," the statement said.</p><p>News outlets were asked to sign the revised guidelines by next week.</p><p>The Association also said it was "surprised and disturbed to learn through the new policy statement that the Pentagon plans to move all of our news organizations from our dedicated workspaces," a move it fears will isolate reporters and make it more difficult to communicate with sources and military spokespeople.</p><p>"We hope the Pentagon reconsiders," the Association said.</p><p>Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said on X that the department has taken an "accommodating approach" and "engaged in good-faith negotiations with the Pentagon Press Association, maintaining open dialogue with its members and accepting many of their suggested edits."</p><p>Parnell said reporters are not required to clear their stories with the Pentagon, and are only being asked to confirm that they understand the department's policies on how information is handled.</p>
<p>"Access to the Pentagon is a privilege, not a right and the Department is not only legally permitted, but morally obligated to impose reasonable regulations on the exercise of that privilege," Parnell wrote.</p>

<div class="article-title">How one principal used debate to turn a failing middle school around</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>At Middle School 50 in Brooklyn, New York, principal Benjamin Honoroff and his students are pumped to start the day — a dramatic transformation from when he came in a decade ago.</p><p>"We were on a list of persistently dangerous schools, and there'd been some pretty drastic enrollment decline from over a thousand students to 160 students," Honoroff said.</p><p>But the former high school debate coach had an idea. He took a chance and integrated <span class="link">debate</span> into every class, across all grade levels. He also expanded the debate team, and a third of the students enrolled with a select group traveling to tournaments. </p><p>Seventh grader Aria Rana says being on the debate team has helped her academically. </p><p>"I've noticed my words and my writing structure has become much better just in the time I've been in debate," Rana said.</p>
<p>Debate is infused into every subject, including math.</p><p>"For example, a ratio problem — are they going to use a ratio table, are they going to use a double number line? And what we find is when students explain their mathematical reasoning, it really deepens their conceptual understanding," Honoroff said.</p><p>The gamble paid off. Within a few years, test scores started to rise, enrollment increased and the debate team started to win. Proficiency scores, which had been in the single digits, jumped up to 60% in English and 70% in math, Honoroff said. </p><p>Erick Williams and his debate partner, Anedwin Moran, first found success at the local state level.</p>
<p>"I felt like it kind of gave us an edge when we went to tournaments because we were kind of already used to it," Williams said.</p><p>Then, last June, as eighth graders competing at the largest middle school debate tournament in the country, they won the national championship in policy debate.</p><p>"I was so happy. I couldn't process nothing. I was really happy and excited," Moran said.</p><p>"When I, like, really snapped into it and realized what we had accomplished, it took me back to, like, when we was in sixth grade, I wasn't even a registered debater. It felt like a journey worth taking," Williams said.</p><p>It was a journey that started with a principal who believed anything was possible with debate. </p><p>"There's a deep, deep pride in this school as a community hub. It's inspiring every day to walk down the block and have people say, I went to that school and, you know, keep it going, keep it going," Honoroff said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Anxiety grows in Portland amid Trump's effort to send in National Guard</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Portland, Oregon</em> — Ongoing protests outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in Portland, Oregon, have largely been contained to a single block in the downtown South Waterfront neighborhood, but the perception of Portland as unsafe has created ripple effects across this 135-square-mile city.  </p><p>On one particular October day, Mother's Bistro and Bar in downtown Portland was seeing more customers than usual, which is rare, according to longtime owner Lisa Schroeder.  </p><p>"You know, we have our days where we're busy, but it's not like it used to be," Schroeder told CBS News. </p><p>Schroeder said that since the 2020 pandemic and ensuing social justice protests emptied out downtown, business has gone from bad to worse.</p><p>Portland has recently been afocal point in President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to quell opposition to ICE activity in blue cities. </p>
<p>On Sept. 28, Mr. Trump <span class="link">announced</span> he would be deploying federal troops to Portland in response to the protests at the South Waterfront ICE facility, describing the city in a social media post as "war-ravaged." The Trump administration later confirmed it would be placing 200 Oregon National Guard troops under federal control for a period of 60 days. </p><p><span class="link">Speaking to</span> hundreds of generals and admirals on Sept. 30 at the Marine Corps Museum in Quantico, Virginia, Mr. Trump called Portland a "war zone."</p><p>And on Oct. 5, he told reporters that "Portland is burning to the ground." </p><p>"My business is half of what it was, but it's certainly not going to get better by somebody telling the world that our city is war-ravaged," Schroeder said. </p>
<p>On Saturday, <span class="link">in response to a lawsuit</span> from the state of Oregon, a Trump-appointed federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking the federalization and deployment of Oregon National Guard troops, and a day later, the same judge <span class="link">blocked the deployment</span> of any National Guard troops to Oregon from other states as the Pentagon said that it planned to send another 200 California National Guard troops to Portland.   </p><p>On Wednesday, an appeals court temporarily granted a White House request that the 200 Oregon National Guard troops remain under federal control. However, the appellate court noted that National Guard troops are still prohibited from deploying to Portland while the case plays out.</p>
<p>Business owners have submitted legal declarations of support for the state's lawsuit, saying the president's rhetoric has been damaging.</p><p>Diners here feel it, too.</p><p>"No, it's not Portlanders," one diner at Mother's Bistro and Bar said of the Rose City when asked if the city is a warzone. "It's not who Portland is, and it's not the 99.9% of who's out there."</p><p>Schroeder says that Portland has an "image problem."</p><p>"I feel like Goliath is coming after David," Schroeder said. "We're a little city here, just trying to get by, trying to sort out our problems. And we don't need the big cheese to come here... We are definitely in a state of recovery. We are not there."</p>
<p>According to data from the Portland Police Bureau, total crime was down 19% in 2024 compared to 2022. But as the protests play out on the national stage, Schroeder says she is losing money. <strong> </strong>"This does not help," Schroeder said. "It does not help at all. We don't need this. And certainly to spend our money on troops to come here for this... This is what our government is spending money on? It's a shame, a crying shame. And I'm crying."</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><span class="link">Dolly Parton</span> isn't dying, she assured worried fans on Wednesday in a video posted to her social media.</p><p>"I want to say something," the 79-year-old music legend said at the start of the video, which she said was taken on Wednesday.  "I know lately everybody thinks I'm sicker than I am. Do I look sick to you? I'm working hard here." </p><p>She said she was "doing some commercials for the Grand Ole Opry," and stated: "I'm not dying."</p><p>Parton's spokesperson, Marcel Pariseau, told CBS News on Tuesday that she was filming the video to address everyone's concerns. It comes after Parton's sister, Freida Parton, posted on social media asking for prayers for the "9 to 5" singer.</p><p>"I wanted to put everybody's mind at ease," Parton said in her video. "I appreciate your prayers because I'm a person of faith. I could always use the prayers for anything and everything. But I want you to know that I'm OK."</p>
<p>Parton appeared in good spirits and joked that she had seen some AI images of <span class="link">Reba</span> McEntire at her deathbed.</p><p>"If I was really dying, I don't think Reba would be the one at my death bed. She might come visit me earlier," she said. "Anyway, there's just a lot of rumors flying around, but I figured if you heard it from me, you'd know that I was OK."</p><p>The country superstar added that she had not been taking care of herself when her husband <span class="link">Carl Dean, who died earlier this year</span>, was sick for a long time.</p><p>"When I got around to it, the doctor said, 'We need to take care of this. We need to take care of that.' Nothing major but I did have to cancel some things so I could be closer to home," Parton said.</p>
<p>Last month, Parton announced she was <span class="link">postponing her upcoming Las Vegas concerts</span> over recent "health challenges."</p><p>"I'm not ready to die yet," Parton said in closing. "I don't think God is through with me and I ain't done working. So I love you for caring, and thank you for praying for me."</p>

<div class="article-title">California's redistricting plan sparks fierce debate in 2026 governor's race</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>California's controversial plan to redraw its congressional maps mid-decade is among the most pressing issues discussed by <span class="link">candidates in the 2026 gubernatorial race</span>.</p><p>Xavier Becerra, Chad Bianco, Ian Calderon, Stephen J. Cloobeck, Steve Hilton, Katie Porter, Tony Thurmond, Antonio Villaraigosa, Butch Ware, Betty Yee and Leo Zacky shared their thoughts and where they stand on the issue. </p><p>Proposition 50, placed on the ballot by the state legislature for a November special election, would authorize California lawmakers to redraw the state's congressional districts.</p><p>The redistricting effort, backed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, is aimed at sending more Democrats to Congress by redrawing<span class="link"> five of the state's districts for U.S. House seats</span> to be more favorable to Democrats in next year's midterm elections. California Democrats call it a countermeasure to President Trump's push for <span class="link">Texas' recent redistricting</span>, which favors Republicans in the midterms.</p><p>Unlike in Texas, California voters took the power to draw these maps away from lawmakers in 2020 and established an independent redistricting commission. Proposition 50 would give that power back to lawmakers for the next five years, through the next presidential election.</p>
<p>Over several weeks in September, CBS News California Investigates sat down with each candidate to ask questions on a variety of issues that matter to voters, including Proposition 50. </p><p>While Democratic candidates generally backed Proposition 50 along party lines, some admitted unease when pressed on the controversial partisan details. Republican and Green Party opponents defended their opposition as they responded to arguments in favor of the measure.</p>
<h2>What do you think of the governor's plan?</h2>
<p>Former Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat who served as Health and Human Services Secretary in the Biden administration, defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington, saying it would "make sure that Donald Trump doesn't put his thumb on the scale on the votes in Congress."</p><p>Republican candidate Steve Hilton condemned the plan, saying outright that it is "totally corrupt and it's unconstitutional and it is illegal."</p>
<p>"Politicians shouldn't draw their own maps," Hilton said. "I mean, that's obviously wrong and corrupt. Common sense tells you that."</p><p>Former state Assemblymember Ian Calderon, also a Democrat, said he supports the plan and emphasized California's position as a donor state.</p><p>"At the end of the day, if we're going to have hope of any type of leverage throughout the next couple of years during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress, so that we could fight back and secure the money that is coming to California," Calderon said.</p><p>However, he acknowledged unease with the Democratic gerrymandering and noted that his wife vehemently opposed Prop 50.  "She thinks that districts should be drawn by independent redistricting commissions and that it is wrong for the state to be putting its finger on the scale, Calderon said.  </p><p>Republican candidate Leo Zacky called the proposal "unconstitutional," criticizing Democratic lawmakers for redrawing the independent redistricting commission's maps for their own partisan purposes. </p><p>"The way that it's set up is that we, the people, are supposed to figure out how the districts are supposed to be drawn," he said. "[Newsom is] violating the Constitution. He's spending a ton of money doing it. It's trash. It's a waste."</p><p>Green Party candidate Butch Ware accused Democrats of consolidating power under the guise of fighting Republican overreach.</p>
<p>"In the state of California, are y'all feeling that this has been a state that has been well-run and for your best interest? So you're going to essentially hand them the keys to make sure that they own every district in the state? You imagine thinking that you can fight fascism with fascism," Ware said.</p><p>While Democratic former State Controller Betty Yee called the redistricting effort "essential" to prevent the manipulation of elections, "as the president has asked the state of Texas to do."</p><p>"We have a process for this. It's after every decennial census… And just the idea that there is manipulation that is being directed from the top, that's going to affect California's representation, our proportionate representation," Yee said. "We have to fight that."</p><p>Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, who is running as a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is California's opportunity to counter "gerrymandering coming out of states like Texas."</p><p>"Not only will it give voters something better and the chance to gain five new Democratic seats. We're doing it in a way that is transparent," he said. "We're going to do it in a way that lets the voters decide."</p><p>Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, also a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is a necessary response to Republican attempts to rig elections elsewhere.</p><p>"Let the people decide, and I'm for it. I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do," Villaraigosa said.</p>
<p>Businessman Steve Cloobeck, a Democrat, supported the plan and said "we have to preserve Democracy." Another Democrat, Katie Porter, who's a law professor and former member of Congress, said she is in "support of the governor's plan."</p><p>Republican Sheriff Chad Bianco of Riverside County expressed opposition.</p><p>"It's like saying murder is not acceptable, so I'm going to go murder you," Bianco said. "Let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more."</p><h2>Message to Californians who voted for Trump</h2>
<p>The Democratic candidates also explained their message   to the roughly 40% of California voters who supported Donald Trump in 2020, voters whose political representation could be diminished under the new district maps.</p><p>Becerra said he would talk to them "straight out" and emphasized his intention to win every vote. Becerra also emphasized that now is the time to stand up for the rule of law and Democracy.</p><p>"No one should do power grabs. No one is a king. No one has a right to deny you your vote," he said.</p><p>Like Becerra, Calderon said his campaign would focus on listening to all voters, not just talking at them.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of Republicans in the state who don't necessarily love everything Trump is doing," Calderon said. "They just want to be heard."</p><p>Thurmond echoed similar arguments, saying that many of Mr. Trump's voters may not support all of the president's policies.</p><p>"Most Americans do not support attacks on the immigrant communities or education cuts," he said. "Just because they voted for Trump doesn't mean they agree with everything."</p><p>Yee acknowledged that some voters, particularly in rural Republican districts, may feel disenfranchised.</p><p>"What I will say to them also is, look, these are areas of the state that actually want to become vital economies. These are areas that actually have probably disproportionate rates of people on Medicaid. These are parts of the states where people are relying on food assistance more than probably other parts," Yee said. "I would just say, who's going to best represent those interests when those cuts are upon you?"</p><p>Businessman Steve Cloobeck emphasized loyalty to California's interests rather than party politics.</p><p>"I would look at the polls of the state right now. The polls say protect California. Whatever the California customers want, I will be their leader and represent them," Cloobeck said.</p>
<p>Villaraigosa said he expects to alienate some voters on both sides, but believes many are still looking for leadership that bridges divides.</p><p>"I know there are Democrats that I might alienate in the course of this race, and there will be Republicans I alienate. There will also be Democrats and some Republicans that want a leader who's a uniter who wants to work with both sides, who wants the focus on common sense. So you win a few, you lose a few."</p><p>Porter, who has represented a swing district in Orange County, was the only candidate to refuse to directly answer the question, taking issue with the premise that she might need Republican voters to win.</p><p>"How would I need them in order to win?" Porter asked. "If it is me versus a Republican, I think that I will win the people who did not vote for Trump."</p><p>As several of her opponents noted, in California's top-two open primary system, Republican voters could help put a Democratic candidate over the top.  </p><p>Porter then threatened to call off the interview, taking issue with too many follow-up questions. She ultimately stayed and continued answering questions. </p><p>The Republican and Green Party Proposition 50 opponents also defended their opposition to pro-redistricting arguments.  </p>
<h2>Do two wrongs make a right?</h2>
<p>The candidates also confronted the ethical dilemma that even some Prop 50 supporters acknowledge: Does fighting one partisan maneuver with another set the wrong precedent? In other words, do two wrongs make right?</p><p>"It's let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more," Bianco said.</p><p>Becerra defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington.</p><p>"Donald Trump is afraid he's going to lose his slim majority of Republicans come 2026," Becerra said. "So he's trying to rig the process to give himself more Republicans. That is not a Democratic process. We're going to fight as we need to make sure our votes count."</p><p>Calderon offered a conflicted view, calling it "kind of a sh---- choice" but emphasizing the political stakes.</p><p>"If we're going to have hope of any type of leverage during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress."</p><p>Ware warned voters not to fall for partisan manipulation.</p>
<p>"This doesn't serve the voters of California. It serves the DNC. It does not help us. It helps them," Ware said. "They are using Californians essentially as a prop in their battle between Democrats and Republicans."</p><p>Porter said it's not two wrongs, highlighting the nature in which Texas approached its redistricting.</p><p>"What Texas is doing is acting out of the course of the census, not following new census data… They're doing it because Donald Trump instructed them to do it," she said.</p><p>Villaraigosa said he's for letting the people decide on the matter to challenge corruption.</p><p>"I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do," he said.</p><p>Thurmond called the special election on Proposition 50 "an important moment for voters to decide."</p><p>Yee reaffirmed her stance on California's move to counter Texas' redistricting effort.</p>
<p>"Just the idea that there's manipulation that is being directed from the top that's going to affect California's proportionate representation, we have to fight back," she said.</p><p>Cloobeck also highlighted California's position as a donor state.</p><p>"Donald Trump's actions have been such that he wants to just attack California. He has not shown us any gratitude for all the billions of dollars of tax dollars the federal government gets from California," he said.</p><p>Hilton described the difficulty California faces in properly redrawing its congressional districts mid-decade rather than after the federal census every 10 years.</p><p>"By drawing these maps in the middle, they don't know who lives where," he said. "Millions of people have left California. In Los Angeles, whole communities have burned down. Who knows who lives there? There's no way that they can honor that constitutional requirement."</p><p>Hilton stressed that even before Newsom's redistricting effort, California already had "a massively distorted political map."</p><p>Acknowledging that Republicans make up about 40% of the vote in California but have just 17% of the congressional seats, Hilton said, "With this new plan that they've got, it would be down to 6%."</p>
<p>Hilton argued that those voters are being pushed out of representation altogether, saying that the plan would unfairly increase the weight of Democratic votes by as much as eight times compared to Republican ones.</p><p>"We're completely violating the principle of equal protection, the whole idea," Hilton said.</p><p>While candidates differ sharply on Proposition 50, voters will have the final say. The redistricting plan will go before voters in a special election on November 4. If approved, the new congressional maps would remain intact through the 2028 presidential election, until 2030.</p>

<div class="article-title">At the Supreme Court, the case of the candidate who sued, even though he won</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>At the Supreme Court on Wednesday, conservative and liberal justices alike appeared to have little use for either side in a case that tests Illinois voting regulations. The often fractious justices teamed up to have a bit of fun at the expense of two seasoned advocates.</p> <p>At issue was a suit by Rep. Michael Bost, R-Ill., challenging the constitutionality of an Illinois regulation that allows ballots mailed in by Election Day to be counted for up to 14 days after polls close. The lower courts ruled against Bost after finding that he failed to show he was individually harmed by the ballot regulation since he won.</p>
<p>Representing Bost, former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement contended that Bost was harmed by the mail-in ballots because they lowered his margin of victory and because he had to pay staffers during the two week vote count. But Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Elena Kagan were not buying it. Bost's arguments, Roberts said,  boiled down to "Hi, I'm a candidate. These rules apply to me, and I'm suing."</p> <p>Justice Samuel Alito piled on, telling Bost's lawyer, "It's not clear to me why you couldn't have done a lot better than you did in your complaint and alleged what I think a lot of people believe to be true, which is that loosening the rules for counting votes like this generally hurts Republican candidates, generally helps Democratic candidates."</p> <p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor followed up, pointing out the Bost brief "didn't even track our legal language. You didn't put in any facts."</p> <p>When the justices asked whether candidates with no real chance of winning an election should still automatically be able to sue, Clement replied with what was perhaps a tongue-in-cheek statement: "I'm going to stand with the 2% candidate.  I stand in locked shoulder with the Socialist Workers Party" and other candidates who get very few votes.</p>
<p> "Those are interesting bedfellows you're taking," observed Sotomayor. Justice Neil Gorsuch seemed to agree, noting that in a prior Socialist Workers Party case,  "Boy, they had zero chance of winning the election, zero chance."</p> <p>Next up to the lectern was Illinois Solicitor General Jane Notz, who started out by describing how, under Bost's preferred rule, "Any self-declared candidate could challenge any election rule that they happen to have a policy disagreement with, even if that rule were entirely harmless."</p> <p>But she quickly ran into trouble, arguing that only candidates with a chance of winning the election can sue. </p> <p>"What you're sketching out for us is a potential disaster," replied Chief Justice Roberts.</p> <p>Alito asked if Notz was "seriously arguing that whether or not the allegations here are sufficient requires an analysis of the particular background and experience of the candidate who files the complaint?"</p> <p>Gorsuch questioned whether there was "something unseemly about federal courts making prognostications about a candidate's chance of success immediately before an election. Thoughts?"</p> <p>And both Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson seemed to be in agreement that Illinois was "walking away" from arguments laid out in its own brief. Of course, said Kavanaugh, "That's your choice."</p>

<div class="article-title">Israel and Hamas agree on the 'first phase' of Gaza ceasefire deal</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>TEL AVIV — Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire deal that's intended to end to the devastating Gaza war which unleashed the deadliest fighting ever between Israelis and Palestinians. </p> <p>President Trump said on Truth Social that Israel and Hamas "have both signed off on the first Phase of our Peace Plan." </p> <p>"This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace. All Parties will be treated fairly! This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America, and we thank the mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, who worked with us to make this Historic and Unprecedented Event happen. BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!" </p>
<p>The announcement came just hours after Trump told reporters at the White House he was prepared to travel to the Middle East as early as this weekend.</p> <p>Israel and Hamas don't speak to each other directly, requiring indirect negotiations that were brokered by President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as mediators from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey in Sharm-El-Sheikh, Egypt.</p> <p>It is not clear when the ceasefire is due to take effect.  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on social media that the cabinet would meet on Thursday, where they are expected to take vote on the ceasefire deal, "to approve the agreement and bring all our beloved hostages home". </p> <p>In the same social media posting, Netanyahu offered his "heartfelt thanks to President Trump and his team for their dedication to this sacred mission of freeing our hostages." The two later spoke on the phone, in a call the Israeli Prime Minister described as "a very emotional and warm conversation." In the same statement the Prime Minister said he had invited Trump to address the Knesset (Israeli parliament).</p> <p>It is believed the deal calls for Hamas to release nearly 50 hostages, living and dead, and for Israel to free nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.</p>
<p>According to a senior White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, "the deal goes to the Israeli cabinet tomorrow. Once they vote yes, Israel has to withdraw to the line which should take under 24 hours. Then the 72 hour clock begins, and Hamas will try to go earlier if possible. Our assessment is that hostages will begin getting released on Monday."</p>
<p>As outlined by Trump last week, other key elements of the deal call for Hamas to disarm and give up a future role in governing Gaza, the seaside territory devastated by two years of fighting. </p> <p>Israel is expected to keep some troops in Gaza for now, but would eventually remove them as the ceasefire solidifies and peace takes hold. </p> <p>The precise details of these key provisions were not immediately clear.</p> <p>The agreement marks a major breakthrough after multiple failed efforts — and two previous ceasefires that unraveled. A truce reached in January of this year fell apart in March when Israel renewed an offensive in Gaza. An ceasefire in the early days of the war, in November 2023, lasted just a week before collapsing.</p> <p>The broad international effort has built widespread support for the latest ceasefire and raised hopes that this one will last. In both Israeli and the Palestinian societies, strong majorities have favored an end to the fighting. </p>
<p>The war began with a surprise attack by Hamas on southern Israel in the early morning of Oct. 7, 2023. Nearly 1,200 people were killed, mostly Israeli civilians, including many attending a weekend music festival. This was the worst one-day attack on Israel since the country's founding in 1948.</p> <p>Israel unleased a ferocious response that has claimed the lives of more then 67,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children. Israel's sustained bombing campaign and relentless ground force offensives have leveled most of Gaza's homes, schools, hospitals and businesses. Israel has limited aid to Gaza throughout the conflict, leading to desperate shortages of food and medicine.</p> <p>The Gaza population of more than 2 million has been repeatedly uprooted throughout the war, with most residents now squeezed into tent encampments in the southern part of the territory, near the border with Egypt.   </p> <p>An end to the fighting is expected to lead to rapid increases in the supply of food and other basic needs. </p>
<p>But the rebuilding of houses, roads, water and electricity systems will be a project lasting many years. </p> <p>And while an end of the war may now be within reach, there's no clear roadmap to resolve the question of Palestinian political rights.</p> <p>The plan calls for Hamas to step aside after ruling Gaza for nearly two decades. It calls for "qualified Palestinians and international experts" to form a transitional governing committee. In addition, an international "Board of Peace,"  chaired by Trump, would supervise the committee and oversee the reconstruction of Gaza.</p> <p>On the critical question of a Palestinian state, the plan offers a vague call for a "credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood," but provides no details. </p> <p>Israel, meanwhile, has emerged from the war in a much stronger security position after decimating Hamas in Gaza, slamming Hezbollah in Lebanon, and hammering Iran's nuclear facilities.</p> <p>Yet Israel has been isolated internationally for the way it carried out the Gaza war, inflicting so many civilian casualties, restricting humanitarian aid, and damaging so much of the territory's infrastructure. </p>

<div class="article-title">After Spain's blackout, critics blamed renewable energy. It's part of a bigger attack</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Last spring, tens of millions of people lost electricity across Spain, Portugal and part of France. Trains stopped in their tracks, and people were stuck in elevators, as southwestern Europe went without power for — in some cases — more than ten hours.</p> <p>Immediately the finger-point began. Many people blamed solar and wind energy. Spain, one of Europe's front runners in renewable energy, gets about 46% of its power from solar and wind, according to the think tank Ember— sometimes more than 70%.</p>
<p>In the hours after the outage <em>The Daily Mail</em> published the headline "Could renewable energy be to blame for huge Spain blackout?"</p> <p>And on the day of the outage U.S. energy secretary and former fracking executive Chris Wright went on CNBC to talk about the outage and criticized solar and wind. "When you hitch your wagon to the weather," Wright said, "it's just a risky endeavor."</p> <p>The idea that solar and wind are inherently risky and unreliable is a common talking point for critics of renewable energy, often repeated by groups with ties to the fossil fuel industry. It's false. When renewable energy is paired with large batteries or other forms of grid management, it's proven to be reliable.</p> <p>Now a new report from an expert panel of European grid operators details what happened. The report finds that for the first time in Europe, a voltage surge caused the massive outage. Voltage needs to remain within limits for an electrical grid to work. While many things went wrong, the problem was not a power grid with too much wind or solar, says Chris Rosslowe, a senior energy analyst at Ember who was not involved in drafting the report.</p> <p>"It contradicts the numerous claims that we've seen that an overreliance on renewables was the cause," Rosslowe says. "That is clearly not true."</p>
<p>But the misinformation about solar and wind energy causing the outage has had an impact. A new survey found that a majority of Spanish respondents believe at least one false narrative about the blackout, and the most common was that too much reliance on renewable energy was to blame.</p> <p>Countries around the world are using renewable energy to move away from polluting fossil fuels. That's why it's so important to counter false narratives about solar and wind, says Philip Newell, communications co-chair of the Climate Action Against Disinformation, a coalition of nonprofits.</p> <p>"This content makes it seem more normal and feel more normal to hate on renewables," Newell says. "Even though they're a solution to climate change."</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>What did happen before the outage</strong></h3> <p>The new report from the European grid operators' expert panel found multiple triggers shortly before the blackout.</p> <p>First, oscillations, or sudden swings in power flow, hit the grid. It's still unclear what caused them. Spain's main grid operator took steps to control the oscillations, including sending less power to France. While these actions helped dampen the oscillations, they caused the voltage to surge upwards.</p> <p>Voltage is like pressure in a water system. Just like it's key to have a certain amount of pressure for water to flow, there needs to be a certain amount of voltage to push electrons through a circuit. But voltage can't be too high, or it can cause short circuits or even fires.</p> <p>When the voltage surged, transformers and power plants shut down. Antonio Gómez-Expósito, electrical engineering professor at University of Seville, says the outage shows that Spain needs more regulations around controlling voltage.</p> <p>The expert panel report, like other recent analyses from Spain's government and main grid operator, does not indicate that reliance on solar or wind power led to the outage. The panel will issue a final report next year.</p>
<p>Newell says the immediate accusations against renewable energy didn't surprise many people who study attacks on climate solutions. "We've known this has been a recurring issue," Newell says. "The big frame is that 'renewables are bad and we can't trust them'."</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Renewable critics said blackout was caused by lack of "inertia" - it wasn't</strong></h3> <p>When critics of renewable energy pointed the finger at solar or wind for causing the blackout, many used one word: inertia.</p> <p>Michael Shellenberger, a longtime critic of renewable energy and proponent of nuclear power with 1.4 million followers on X, said in a post the day of the blackout, "Renewables don't risk blackouts, said the media. But they did and they do… it's clear that too little 'inertia' due to excess solar resulted in system collapse."</p>
<p>Inertia is important to the electrical grid because it can help stabilize sudden fluctuations in a grid's frequency. Power plants that run on gas, coal or nuclear use large spinning turbines that create electricity and have inertia. More modern power resources, like wind, solar, and batteries, don't involve inertia, because they are digitally controlled. "Wind and solar plants either have no inertia or very little," Gómez-Expósito says, "but in return, they have infinitely greater response speeds."</p> <p>There is no indication that a lack of inertia was the cause of the outage, Gómez-Expósito says. Spain's main grid operator, Red Eléctrica, released a report about the outage this summer. "The incident was not caused by an inertia problem," it said in a press release.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>Renewable misinformation has an impact</strong></h3> <p>False claims that too much reliance on solar and wind caused the blackout in Spain and Portugal fit into broader attacks on renewable energy.</p> <p>In winter 2021, a massive power outage hit Texas. Investigations ultimately found that the outage's cause was gas and coal plants that were forced offline because of freezing temperatures. But critics of renewable energy blamed solar and wind, says Timmons Roberts, professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University.</p>
<p> "In 2021, again, there was uncertainty on what caused it, but immediately there were attacks on renewable energy," Roberts says. " Sort of exploiting, taking advantage of a crisis to make unfounded accusations."</p>
<p>Shortly after the power went out in Spain, Newell and his team from the Climate Action Against Disinformation Coalition decided to do a survey about false narratives in the blackout's wake. They surveyed 1,200 people in Spain and 1,200 in the United Kingdom – because many in the U.K. were also paying attention to the outage.</p> <p>They found seven in ten in Spain and six in ten in the U.K. fell for at least one false narrative about the blackout causes. The most commonly believed false narrative was that the reliance on renewables was at fault.</p> <p>Newell says while most of the survey respondents acknowledge the reality of climate change, misinformation led many to question the reliability of renewable energy.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>Renewable energy plus batteries proving to be reliable in warming world</strong></h3> <p>Solar and wind resources are already proving to be part of a reliable grid, says Elliot Mainzer, chief executive of the California Independent System Operator, which assures the reliability of California's grid. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available.</p> <p>Mainzer says the key is pairing solar and wind energy with massive batteries. Batteries are especially important with solar, as they absorb excess solar energy during the day, and send it back into the grid after the sun sets and evening demand stays high, Mainzer says.</p> <p>Mainzer says older power sources have their own problems. California faces a loss of hydropower during droughts. And Mainzer says, gas power plants have some reliability challenges, too.</p> <p>" During the kind of heat waves we've seen in recent years, the natural gas plants can come under some significant strain," Mainzer says. "They have to run harder, they mechanically get challenged, and we tend to see a higher outage rate amongst the gas fleet when the temperatures are really, really hot."</p>
<p>Mainzer says the use of solar plus batteries helped prevent blackouts in California in 2022 when there was a heatwave hitting much of the state and gas plants were under performing. Texas' main grid operator, ERCOT, has also said that an increase in solar and battery storage has helped the state avoid power outages — especially as the state sees unexpected outages with coal plants.</p> <p>As the planet sees longer and more intense heat waves with global warming, primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels, Mainzer says solar combined with batteries, both of which perform well in the heat, will be important to keep the lights on.</p>

<div class="article-title">Too many Canadians are staying away from Louisiana due to Trump</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Canadians who are usually drawn to New Orleans'  French culture are staying away this year. Louisiana's lieutenant governor says that's because they're upset with President Trump.</p>
</div>
<div aria-label="Transcript" class="transcript storytext">
<b class="icn-story-transcript-wrap">
</b>
<p>JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: </p><p> There are not enough Canadians visiting Louisiana this year, according to the state's lieutenant governor. So he went to Canada recently to promote his state, which has a strong French-speaking connection to its neighbors up north. Turns out a lot of Canadians are upset with President Trump. Alex Cox with member station WRKF in Baton Rouge reports.</p><p>ALEX COX, BYLINE: This weekend is the start of the Grand Reveil Acadien near Lafayette, Louisiana. The festival happens every five years and celebrates the Acadians - descendants of early French settlers who came to Louisiana from Canada in the 1700s. It attracts a lot of tourists from Canada, but not so much this year. At least one tour company canceled.</p><p>RANDAL MENARD: Those four buses went away.</p><p>COX: That's Randal Menard, the president of the nonprofit that puts on the festival. The tour operator told him Canadians just didn't want to come this year.</p><p>MENARD: After the tariffs and the president's comments, he let us know that people were dropping like flies.</p><p>COX: He's referring to the comments President Trump has made about Canada becoming the 51st state and his ongoing international trade war. Just this week, in a meeting with the Canadian prime minister, Trump cracked a joke about a, quote, "merger" of the two countries. Louisiana Republican Lieutenant Governor Billy Nungesser is asking the president to apologize to Canadians for those remarks. This is because on a recent trip to Canada, he heard how upset people there were.</p><p>BILLY NUNGESSER: They just pretty much said they're not coming back until he's either out of office or he apologized.</p><p>COX: Nungesser hasn't heard back from the president, and he says that an apology might not fully fix things anyway, but he doesn't know what else to do. He says tourism from Canada is down 20- to 30%, and data from Canada shows a 25% drop in U.S. visits in July compared to last year. He says the U.S. has become an unpopular destination for Canadians.</p><p>NUNGESSER: Airlines, they still have their flights, but they're not advertising travel to America.</p><p>COX: The Grand Reveil Acadien festival this weekend will be flooded with Louisiana French music and the smells of good old Louisiana cooking. And locals will celebrate without many of their Canadian cousins, says Menard.</p><p>MENARD: I mean, we're going to miss their presence. The program will go on, but it's not going to be the same without their participation.</p><p>COX: He hopes their absence will only be temporary.</p><p>For NPR News, I'm Alex Cox in Baton Rouge.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>

<div class="article-title">Los Angeles: Spaghetti Cumbia, a band born from cultural fusion</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p><em>This is part of a special series, </em><em>Cumbia Across Latin America</em><em>, a visual report across six countries developed over several years, covering the people, places and cultures that keep this music genre alive.</em></p> <p>Marcel Campos, the lead singer of Spaghetti Cumbia, often talks about being caught in between two cultures — not Mexican enough for Mexicans and not American enough for Americans. <em>Ni de aquí, ni de allá</em>. The Spaghetti sound was born out of a fusion of the two cultures. The members of the band all have deep connections to their Mexican roots. They grew up listening to Latin music in their homes and at family parties in Boyle Heights and East LA. Paulo Paredones, the bass player, known as El Maniacs, remembers yelling at his dad to turn down the cumbia. But growing up in LA, they were also heavily influenced by classic rock, punk rock and hip-hop. The band created their own style, mixing cumbia with all their influences and adding a Spaghetti Western sound.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, the land east of the Los Angeles River became a destination for immigrants, and by the 1940s, the area was mostly Latino. Today, East LA and Boyle Heights are both about 95% Latino, and Los Angeles County has the largest Hispanic population in the country, with 4.8 million people.</p>
<p>The band members were teenagers in the '90s when gang violence was at its peak on the city's east side. Pedro Zapata, or Pedro Pistolas, one of the band's guitarists and vocalists, remembers when over half of his friends were joining gangs. Like some of the other band members, he was tempted to follow. Looking back, they say they're thankful they didn't — many of their friends were shot down in the streets or ended up spending their lives in prison. Their love for playing music may have saved them by connecting them with a different crowd. There was no time to spend on the streets with rehearsals and studio recordings.</p>
<p>Although Marcel plans to build a "Spaghetti Empire" and the band members dream of hitting it big, right now, they all work multiple jobs. Campos works at Costco and delivers for Instacart, often sleeping only a few hours. Because of the cost of living in California, he must hustle to support his family. As the band plays larger venues, the extra income really helps to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Spaghetti formed nine years ago and began playing in a small mezcal bar in downtown LA, called Las Perlas. Campos or Paredones would light a stick of palo santo before performing to clean the space of any negative energy. The place would fill up fast and the band would set up right on the dance floor, playing to a Latino crowd. Under the dim red lights, the audience and the band became one, swimming in a sea of sound. </p>
<p>Paredones laid down thumping cumbia bass lines as Adolfo Mercado, often compared to Animal of The Muppets, wailed on the drums. With their wireless guitars, Bobby Guerrero, also known as El Gallo, and Zapata weaved through the crowd playing psychedelic guitar riffs. Campos, tapping into his punk rock influences, ripped his shirt off and poured all his energy into the show. The crowd would dance, scream and let go of the stress of everyday life.</p>

<div class="article-title">Los Ángeles: Spaghetti Cumbia, una banda nacida de la fusión cultural</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p><em>Esta cobertura es parte de una serie especial, </em><em>Cumbia across Latin America</em><em>, un reportaje visual en seis países documentado durante varios años, que abarca seis países y cubre a las personas, lugares y culturas que mantienen vivo este género musical.</em></p> <p>Marcel Campos, vocalista de Spaghetti Cumbia, habla a menudo de estar atrapado entre dos culturas: no es suficientemente mexicano ni estadounidense. "Ni de aquí, ni de allá". El sonido Spaghetti nació de la fusión de estas dos culturas. Los miembros de la banda tienen profundos vínculos con sus raíces mexicanas. Crecieron escuchando música latina en sus casas y en fiestas familiares en Boyle Heights y en East L.A. Paulo Paredones, el bajista, recuerda que le gritaba a su padre que bajara el volumen de la cumbia. Al crecer en Los Ángeles, también se vieron muy influenciados por el rock clásico, el punk rock y el hip hop. El grupo creó su propio estilo, mezclando cumbia con todas sus influencias y añadiendo un sonido de <em>spaghetti western</em>.</p>
<p>A principios del siglo XX, las tierras al este del río Los Ángeles se convirtieron en destino de inmigrantes. Hoy en día, East L.A. y Boyle Heights son ambos 95 % latinos, y el condado de Los Ángeles tiene la mayor población latina de Estados Unidos.</p>
<p>Los miembros de la banda eran adolescentes en los años 90, cuando la violencia de las pandillas estaba en su punto más alto en el este de la ciudad. Pedro Zapata, o Pedro Pistolas, uno de los guitarristas y vocalistas del grupo, recuerda que más de la mitad de sus amigos se unían a pandillas. Como algunos de los otros miembros de la banda, él también sintió la tentación de seguir ese camino. Al mirar atrás, dicen que están agradecidos de no haberlo hecho. Muchos de sus amigos fueron asesinados en las calles o pasaron el resto de sus vidas en prisión. Su amor por la música quizá los salvó, al conectarlos con otro tipo de gente. Entre los ensayos y las grabaciones en el estudio, no quedaba tiempo para pasar en las calles.</p>
<p>Aunque quisieran dedicar toda su energía a la banda, todos tienen otro trabajo. Campos trabaja en Costco y hace entregas para Instacart, a veces durmiendo solo unas horas. El costo de vida en California le exige más horas de trabajo para mantener a su familia. A medida que la banda toca en locales más grandes, los ingresos extra le ayudan a llegar a fin de mes.</p>
<p>Spaghetti se formó hace nueve años y comenzó tocando en un pequeño bar de mezcal en el centro de Los Ángeles, llamado Las Perlas. Antes de cada presentación, Campos o Paredones encendían un palo santo para limpiar el espacio de cualquier energía negativa. El lugar se llenaba rápidamente y la banda se instalaba directamente en la pista de baile, tocando para un público latino. Bajo las luces rojas y tenues, la audiencia y la banda se fundían en un mar de sonidos.</p>
<p>Paredones marcaba líneas de bajo cumbieras mientras Adolfo Mercado, a quien muchos comparan con Animal de The Muppets, desataba su energía en la batería. Con sus guitarras inalámbricas, Bobby Guerrero, también conocido como El Gallo, y Zapata se abrían paso entre la multitud tocando riffs psicodélicos. Campos, influenciado por el punk rock, se arrancaba la camiseta y entregaba toda su energía al espectáculo. El público bailaba, gritaba y dejaba escapar el estrés del día a día.</p>

<div class="article-title">Democrats to force vote to limit Trump war powers after strikes on Venezuelan boats</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A pair of Senate Democrats is responding to a series of unprecedented U.S. military strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea ordered by President Trump with a plan to force a Senate vote on a war powers resolution blocking the escalated action by the commander in chief.</p> <p>Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are pushing for the vote despite tough odds for passage as support among Republicans appears limited so far. They argue the White House has not provided evidence to justify the attacks, which they believe are illegal and unconstitutional. </p> <p>The two Democrats also say<strong> </strong>it's clear Congress has not authorized the use of such force.</p> <p>"The resolution would stop this blowing up of ships," Schiff told reporters in the Capitol ahead of the vote. "It would also address the administrations' threat that they're going to go potentially beyond blowing up ships at sea to attacking targets on land in Venezuela or elsewhere."</p> <p>Last month, Trump ordered three U.S. military strikes on boats after administration officials suspected them as carrying members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang smuggling drug shipments from Venezuela. So far 21 people have been killed, but their identities have yet to be shared.</p>
<p>Venezuelan officials say at least some of those killed were not gang members, creating a new unease in the region. But the Trump<strong> </strong>administration insists the strikes were entirely legal, arguing narco-traffickers are now military threats and not law enforcement threats.</p> <p>The move has upended the U.S. drug interdiction program, where the Coast Guard traditionally intercepts vessels at sea, confiscates illegal drugs and takes suspected drug traffickers into custody to face criminal charges.</p> <p>Kaine said more than two dozen congressional Democrats wrote the Trump administration demanding answers to a series of questions regarding the legal basis for the strike, but have yet to get a response weeks later. Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said one closed door briefing has been held for senators so far, but that brought little clarity.</p> <p>"A room full of people from the administration," Kaine told reporters. Yet "no information about why attacking rather than interdicting."</p> <p>Kaine and Schiff worry that the military strikes could lead the U.S. unexpectedly and unintentionally into war.</p> <p>It's unclear many Republicans will join Democrats in the effort, with a vote expected in the coming day. However, Schiff and Kaine said they could bring the resolution up again if it doesn't pass on the first try.</p>
<p>It appears at least one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has long pushed war powers limits, is on board. Many others, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have defended the administration's actions, arguing the rules of engagement have shifted.</p> <p>However, Schiff and Kaine say without the identities of those killed, it's possible the U.S. got it wrong or may in the future.</p> <p>"I have no idea precisely the identities of who was on these ships, or even whether the administration knows their identities, and that's a real problem," Schiff said. "Are they killing people who were not engaged in trafficking? I just don't know the answer to that question."</p> <p>Kaine says that fuels a new wave of questions.</p> <p>"The suspicious mind in me says it's because there aren't good answers," he said.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Dozens of Bob Ross paintings will be auctioned to help public TV after funding cuts</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Dozens of Bob Ross paintings — many of them created live on the PBS series that made him a household name — will be auctioned off in the coming months to support public television.</p> <p>Ross, with his distinctive afro, soothing voice and sunny outlook, empowered millions of viewers to make and appreciate art through his show <em>The Joy of Painting</em>. More than 400 half-hour episodes aired on PBS (and eventually the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) from 1983 to 1994, the year before Ross died of cancer at age 52.</p> <p>Ross' impact lives on: His show still airs on PBS and streams on platforms like Hulu and Twitch. It has surged in popularity in recent years, particularly as viewers searched for comfort during COVID-19 lockdowns. Certified instructors continue teaching his wet-on-wet oil painting technique to the masses, and the Smithsonian acquired several of his works for its permanent collection in 2019.</p>
<p>Now, the nonprofit syndicator American Public Television (APT) is auctioning off 30 of Ross' paintings to raise money for public broadcasters hit by federal funding cuts. APT has pledged to direct 100% of its net sales proceeds to APT and PBS stations nationwide, auction house Bonhams said in a statement.</p> <p>Bonhams is calling this the "largest single offering of Bob Ross original works ever brought to market." Ross has become synonymous with public broadcasting — some activists have even invoked him in their calls for restoring federal funding to it.</p> <p>"Bob Ross dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone through public television," said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross, Inc. "This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades."</p> <p>The first three paintings will be auctioned in Los Angeles on Nov. 11. The rest will be sold throughout 2026 at Bonham's salerooms in Los Angeles, New York and Boston.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">How the offering could benefit public broadcasters </h3> <p>At President Trump's direction, Congress voted in July to claw back $1.1 billion in previously allocated funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), leaving the country's roughly 330 PBS and 244 NPR stations in a precarious position.</p>
<p>CPB began shutting down at the end of September, PBS has already cut 15% of its jobs, and several local TV and radio stations have also announced layoffs and closures.</p>
<p>The Ross auction aims to help stations pay their licensing fees to the national TV channel Create, which in turn allows them to air popular public television programs including <em>The Best of the Joy of Painting</em> (based on Ross' show), <em>America's Test Kitchen, Rick Steve's Europe and </em>Julia Child's<em> French Chef Classics</em>.</p> <p>Bonhams says the auction proceeds will help stations — particularly smaller and rural ones — defray the cost burden of licensing fees, making Create available to more of them.</p> <p>"This enables stations to maintain their educational programming while redirecting funds toward other critical operations and local content production threatened by federal funding cuts," the auction house says.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Ross' paintings rarely hit the market</h3> <p>The 30 paintings going up for sale span Ross' career and are all "previously unseen by the public except during their creation in individual episodes" of <em>The Joy of Painting,</em> according to Bonhams. Many have remained in secure storage ever since.</p> <p>They include vibrant landscapes, with the serene mountains, lake views and "happy trees" that became his trademark.</p>
<p>Ross started painting during his 20-year career in the Air Force, much of which was spent in Alaska. That experience shaped his penchant for landscapes and ability to work quickly — and, he later said, his desire not to raise his voice once out of the service.</p> <p>Once on the airwaves, Ross' soft-spoken guidance and gentle demeanor won over millions of viewers. His advice applied to art as well as life: Mistakes are just "happy accidents," talent is a "pursued interest," and it's important to "take a step back and look."</p>
<p>"Ross' gentle teaching style and positive philosophy made him a cultural icon whose influence extends far beyond the art world," Bonhams says.</p>
<p>While Ross was prolific, his paintings were intended for teaching instead of selling, and therefore rarely go on the market.</p>
<p>In August, Bonhams sold two of Ross' early 1990s mountain and lake scenes as part of an online auction of American art. They fetched $114,800 and $95,750, surpassing expectations and setting a new auction world record for Ross — at least for the time being.</p> <p>"With his market continuing to climb, proceeds benefiting American Public Television, and many of the paintings created live on air — a major draw for collectors — we expect spirited bidding and results that could surpass previous records," Robin Starr, the general manager of its subsidiary Bonhams Skinner, told NPR in a statement.</p> <p>Bonhams estimates that the next 30 paintings could go for a combined total between $850,000 and $1.4 million.</p> <p><em>Disclosure: This story was edited by general assignment editor Carol Ritchie and managing editor Vickie Walton-James.

<div class="article-title">Why gold is having its best year since 1979</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Gold has broken yet another record this week, illustrating just how anxious investors are about the health of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.</p> <p>The precious metal is usually seen as a "safe haven" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including upending global trade and threatening the independence of the Federal Reserve.</p> <p>On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly shrugged off this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the value of the U.S. dollar has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.</p> <p>"Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak," says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.</p> <p>"Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result," he added.</p>
<p>Now gold is having its hottest year in nearly half a century — since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.</p> <p>And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs predicted that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.</p> <p>Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls "upside risk").</p> <p>"While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target," Struyven says</p> <h3 class="edTag">Gold may be known as a "safe haven" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it</h3> <p>Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the "fear trade." As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.</p>
<p>"When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates," Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta, told NPR this spring.</p> <p>But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.</p>
<p>There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.</p> <p>For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.</p> <p>More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.</p> <p>"Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well," he says. "Diversification matters."<br/></p>
