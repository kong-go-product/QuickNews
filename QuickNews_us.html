<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Texas quarterback Arch Manning may have suffered an injury during the team’s overtime comeback win at Mississippi State on Saturday.</p><p>Manning scrambled for 13 yards on the first play of overtime but then left the field appearing to be experiencing pain in his upper body. Backup quarterback Matthew Caldwell entered and threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Emmett Mosley for the 45-38 win.</p><p>Texas coach Steve Sarkisian did not immediately provide an update on Manning after the game. Instead, the coach praised Caldwell's performance off the bench.</p><p>"I think his rapport with Arch was a big part of it. They have a great relationship," Sarkisian said of Caldwell. "What a moment for that guy to step in and make that throw."</p><p>Prior to the injury, Manning led the Longhorns (6-2, 3-1 Southeastern Conference) back from a 17-point, fourth-quarter deficit, completing 29 of 46 passes for 346 yards, three touchdowns and one interception, while rushing for a touchdown.</p><p>Manning previously faced criticism for a subpar performance against Kentucky last week, in what has been a polarizing season for the prized quarterback.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday said that the U.S., Israel and other mediators of the Gaza peace deal had shared intelligence to avoid a possible attack last weekend and would do so going forward. </p><p>"We put out a message through State Department, sent it to our mediators as well, about an impending attack, and it didn’t happen," he told reporters while flying from Israel to Qatar. "So that’s the goal here, is ultimately to identify a threat before it happens."</p><p>This comes a week after the State Department said it had "credible reports" that Hamas was planning an attack on Palestinian civilians in violation of the agreement.</p><p>Rubio said Saturday the U.S. has talked with countries like Qatar, Egypt and Turkey who are interested in contributing to an international stabilization force in the region. He added that Indonesia and Azerbaijan are also interested.</p><p>But, he said, "Many of the countries who want to be a part of it can’t do it without" a United Nations resolution supporting the force.</p><p>Rubio also met with President Donald Trump in Qatar ahead of the president's Asian tour.</p><p>Vice President JD Vance was also in Israel earlier this week along with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner in an attempt to solidify the ceasefire deal, which took effect earlier this month.</p><p>Next week, Rubio said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, is expected to travel to Israel as well.</p><p>Trump thanked Qatar for their part in helping secure the peace deal while meeting with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thanimet and Qatar Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani.</p><p>"This should be an enduring peace," Trump told reporters of the deal.</p><p>His visit to Qatar was part of a refueling stop before heading on to Asia.</p><p><i>The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">'Man vs Wild' star Bear Grylls says writing about Jesus was harder than climbing Mount Everest</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>"Man vs. Wild" star Bear Grylls said writing about Jesus was the "hardest thing" he’s ever done, tougher than climbing Mount Everest or sailing a frozen sea, he told Fox News.</p><p>"It's been the hardest thing I've ever done, but also the best thing I have ever done," Grylls told "My View with Lara Trump." "My faith has always been like a quiet, empowering presence through so many adventures."</p><p>The U.K.-born survival expert’s book "The Greatest Story Ever Told: An Eyewitness Account," which was released in June, chronicles the life of Jesus into what he described as a punchy, faith-filled thriller.</p><p>"The real story of Jesus is so mind-blowing. It's a story of true courage, true friendship, true love, and I just thought nobody's ever written this as a thriller, I'm just going to write this story,' he said.</p><p>Grylls said his curiosity and desire to explore a truer version of the story inspired the project.</p><p>"I never really was brought up knowing… the real story of Jesus," the survival expert explained. "I always grew up with such a sanitized version of it, I didn't really like it."</p><p>Grylls has hosted more than a dozen survival shows since 2006 — a number of them on the Discovery Channel — which he said approached him after his successful climb of Mount Everest.</p><p>"Everest is always going to be in my heart because we had climbers lose their lives up there. Two died of the cold, two fell, and I think that mountain shaped so much of the future of my life. It was through that that the Discovery Channel eventually approached me, and we saw ‘Man vs. Wild,’ and that grew into ‘Running Wild’ and all these shows," he said.</p><p>The adventurer said the reaction to his book has surpassed anything he’s experienced in television.</p><p>"I think I've had more response from this book than anything else I've ever done, any TV show," he said.</p><p>Beyond his career and faith, Grylls also spoke about the importance of getting outdoors.</p><p>"For me, the outdoors has always been such a beautiful, healing, grounding place," Grylls said. "That’s where I’d go to reconnect."</p><p>He worries that modern life has veered people away from nature.</p><p>"I think everyone's scared of the sun nowadays," he said.</p><p>"Try and just be disciplined about your time on your screen. It's not that it's bad, but try and just police yourself a little bit," Grylls recommended.</p><p>For Grylls, adventures aren’t always about the thrill of the feat, but living with intention.</p><p>"It doesn’t have to be the highest mountain in the world," he said. "It's how you live, how you approach risk, relationships, family, business and everything."</p><p>And it’s a life, he admitted, that he has no plans to change.</p><p>"I've burned so many bridges in my life," he reflected. "I have no other option apart from doing what I do — and I kind of like that." </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Arrests made as anti-ICE agitators caught on camera clashing with federal officers outside Portland facility</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A female protester was arrested outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland, Oregon, Saturday afternoon after crossing a restricted line during a tense standoff with federal officers, according to new video shared with Fox News Digital by TPUSA Frontlines.</p><p>The clip, just over a minute-long, shows officers shouting commands as a woman in a keffiyeh steps past a blue line painted on the property.</p><p>Within seconds, several officers pull her toward the entrance of the facility as others move to hold back the crowd. Protesters can be heard yelling as the confrontation unfolds, and pepper spray is deployed.</p><p>TPUSA Frontlines told Fox News Digital that the woman "crossed the line ICE does not want them passing" and appeared to make contact with an officer before she was detained. Frontlines added that the crowd was expected to grow later in the evening once the rain cleared.</p><p>In a statement to Fox News Digital, Portland Police Bureau confirmed two arrests connected to Saturday's protests.</p><p>"PPB has arrested two people for crimes committed today. I do not have names or charges yet. The officers haven’t even transported them back to the precinct yet, so it will be a while," the spokesperson said. "As we have every night for many weeks, PPB continues to monitor the area for criminal behavior."</p><p>ICE did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s inquiry seeking confirmation of whether the woman’s arrest was carried out by its personnel or whether pepper spray was used by agency officers.</p><p>Protests outside the ICE facility in Portland have become a near-nightly occurrence in recent weeks, with activists opposing detentions and deportations.</p><p>TPUSA Frontlines also claimed that demonstrators appeared to have a so-called "safe house" near downtown Portland where they stored materials and coordinated activities. That claim has not been independently verified by Fox News Digital.</p><p>Portland police have repeatedly said they will continue to monitor gatherings near the ICE building for unlawful behavior..</p><p>The Portland facility is one of several ICE locations nationwide that have been targeted by demonstrators in recent months, often resulting in property damage and arrests.</p><p>The two individuals arrested Saturday have not yet been publicly identified. Officials said additional information would be released once booking is completed.</p><p>ICE did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s inquiry seeking confirmation of the arrest or comment on enforcement activity outside the facility.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump ally who donated $130 million to pay troops amid shutdown revealed as reclusive billionaire heir: report</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The anonymous donor who gave $130 million to the Pentagon to pay troops during the government shutdown has been identified as Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and a major financial backer of President Donald Trump, according to a report.</p><p>Trump announced the donation on Thursday, but declined to reveal the donor's identity, only describing him as a "patriot" and a friend. The president again refused to name the person on Friday while talking to reporters aboard Air Force One shortly after departing Washington for Asia, calling the donor "a great American citizen" and a "substantial man."</p><p>"He doesn’t want publicity," Trump said on Friday. "He prefer that his name not be mentioned, which is pretty unusual in the world I come from, and in the world of politics, you want your name mentioned."</p><p>But the two people familiar with the matter told The New York Times that the man is Mellon, a wealthy banking heir and railroad magnate.</p><p>It remains unclear how long the donation will cover the troops' salaries. The Trump administration’s 2025 budget asked for about $600 billion in total military compensation, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p><p>The $130 million donation would equal about $100 a service member, according to The New York Times.</p><p>Mellon, a grandson of former Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, is a backer of Trump who gave tens of millions of dollars to groups supporting the president’s 2024 campaign. Last year, he gave $50 million to a super PAC supporting Trump, making it one of the largest single contributions ever disclosed, the newspaper noted.</p><p>The billionaire was not a prominent Republican donor until Trump was first elected but has given hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years into supporting the president and the GOP.</p><p>He is also a significant supporter of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who also ran for president in 2024, first as a Democrat and later as an independent before dropping out to endorse Trump. Mellon donated millions to Kennedy’s presidential campaign and has also given money to the secretary's anti-vaccine nonprofit, Children’s Health Defense, according to The New York Times.</p><p>Despite his political contributions, Mellon has sought to keep a low profile.</p><p>In an autobiography published in 2015, Mellon described himself as a former liberal who moved from Connecticut to Wyoming for lower taxes and fewer people.</p><p>The Pentagon said it accepted the donation under the "general gift acceptance authority."</p><p>"The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of service members’ salaries and benefits," Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement to The New York Times.</p><p>But the donation may be a potential violation of the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending money in excess of congressional appropriations or from accepting voluntary services.</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents in Laredo, Texas, arrested a father and son accused of smuggling hundreds of firearms, including rifles, magazines and ammunition into Mexico after Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers discovered hidden compartments in two trailers at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p><p>On Oct. 23, CBP officers working at the Laredo Bridge 2 Port of Entry stopped two southbound vehicles towing box trailers for inspection.</p><p>Agents said they noticed irregularities in the trailer walls.</p><p>A secondary inspection revealed false compartments packed with an arsenal: roughly 400 firearms of various calibers, high-capacity magazines, and thousands of rounds of ammunition.HSI officials said the guns were headed into Mexico, where cartels fuel ongoing violence.</p><p>The drivers were identified as Emilio Ramirez-Cortez, a lawful permanent resident, and his son Edgar Ramirez-Diaz, a U.S. citizen. Both were arrested on charges of federal firearms smuggling and turned over to the U.S. Marshals Service pending an initial court appearance.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The U.S. women's gymnastics team won just two medals at the World Championships in Jakarta this past week. It was the country's lowest medal total in the international competition since 2001. </p><p>The U.S.'s only two medalists were Leanne Wong, who won an all-around silver, and Joscelyn Roberson, who won bronze on vault. </p><p>China finished ahead of the U.S. with three women's medals, while neutral athletes competing on behalf of Russia also won three. </p><p>U.S. program lead Chellsie Memmel addressed the team's underperformance.</p><p>"It was rough," Memmel said, according to Olympics.com. "There were some very good pieces, but then there was rough. I didn’t feel like there was an attack of their events and their skills overall. There were still good things, but I have work to do.</p><p>"We’ll talk it over, but not beat it to death," Memmel continued. "They know what happened. They know they didn’t perform at their best, so they’re going to want to come in and go into training and reset."</p><p>The U.S. is used to regular dominance in the women's category in international gymnastics. This was only the third year since 2006 in which the U.S. didn't finish with the most women's medals since 2006, aside from 2017 and 2021, when it tied with Japan and Russia for most. </p><p>This year, the team was without superstars Simone Biles, Suni Lee, Jade Carey and Jordan Chiles. </p><p>If this past week is any indication, it could spell trouble for the U.S. gymnastics women's dynasty heading into the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. </p><p>"For me, it means going into each turn with the intent that it’s going to be great, and being confident with it," Memmel explained. "Believing in that – believing in themselves – to do that and know that they can perform it when the time comes to raise their hand."</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Allison Janney kept her lips sealed when speaking about her former co-stars.</p><p>During a recent appearance on "Watch What Happens Live!," the 65-year-old actress answered a few shady questions while playing "Agree or Disagree" with her co-star and fellow guest, Keri Russell.</p><p>As part of the game, host Andy Cohen asks a question and, based on their answers, guests will hold up a sign that either says agree or disagree. When Cohen asked if there was a former co-star the two "refuse to work with again," both held up the agree sign. He then said they would get "extra points" if they named the celebrity.</p><p>"Well, mine is no longer with us, so I really can't — I really couldn't work with them again, even if I wanted to," Janney said, before being prompted by Russell and Cohen to reveal who the actor is. "No, I'm not saying it. I will not be lulled into a false sense of safety being in this small little club."</p><p>Russell later reminded her of her mom's rule when it came to "talk[ing] s--- about people," after which Janney shared, "My mom would say 'In the car, windows up, out of the driveway.'"</p><p>Janney and Russell star alongside each other in the Netflix drama "The Diplomat." In the show, Janney plays the fictional president of the United States, Grace Penn, and Russell portrays the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom.</p><p>"The relationship between us is one of the best relationship dynamics I've ever gotten to play," Janney told NPR in October. "And they've had to fight extra hard to be where they are. So, the decisions that they make, especially Grace makes, she's judged much harshly for."</p><p>This season introduced actor Bradley Whitford as the husband of Janney's character. Fans were excited to see the actor cast in the show because he and Janney starred alongside each other on the hit show "The West Wing."</p><p>When speaking with People magazine, Janney said "it was so easy and comfortable" working with Whitford again due to their history together.</p><p>"I think it would've been more difficult with someone I didn't know. It was surprisingly really easy and really fun," she explained. "I was just excited for everyone on ‘Diplomat’ to get to meet Brad and experience everything that is Brad, which is fabulous and joyful and just — he's the dream."</p><p>During her time on "The West Wing," Janney won four Emmy Awards for her portrayal of C.J. Cregg, the White House press secretary. She captured four more for her roles in "Masters of Sex" and the sitcom" Mom."</p><p>She later won her first and only Academy Award in 2018 for her supporting role in "I, Tonya," which told the true story behind the infamous incident involving Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan. The film mainly focused on Harding, her backstory and her involvement in the attack on Kerrigan, with Janney portraying her mother, LaVona.</p><p>"LaVona Harding is one of the cruelest people I’ve ever played," Janney said in a behind-the-scenes clip from the Blu-Ray/DVD release of the film. "They weren’t living in the high life by any stretch, and I think she saw her daughter as a way out of her life.</p><p>"She saw endorsement deals, she saw escape. And she had a lot riding in this relationship with her daughter, and she wanted her daughter to take her out of the trailer park."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump on Saturday said Hamas needs to start returning the bodies of deceased hostages held captive by the terror group during the war in Gaza "quickly, or the other countries involved in this GREAT PEACE will take action."</p><p>While all the living hostages have been returned from Gaza, the remains of 13 deceased hostages have not been handed over by Hamas.</p><p>"Some of the bodies are hard to reach, but others they can return now and, for some reason, they are not," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. "Perhaps it has to do with their disarming, but when I said, ‘Both sides would be treated fairly,’ that only applies if they comply with their obligations. Let’s see what they do over the next 48 hours. I am watching this very closely."</p><p>Hours before Trump's post, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee met with the families of Itay Chen and Omer Neutra, two U.S. citizens who were killed in the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks.</p><p>Their bodies are among those still being held by Hamas.</p><p>"We will not forget the lives of the hostages who died in the captivity of Hamas," Rubio wrote in an X post.

<div class="article-title">Investigators uncover possible serial killer linked to women’s murders, missing TV anchor</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Authorities revealed this week that a man once named a person of interest in the disappearance of Iowa news anchor Jodi Huisentruit was responsible for the 2006 killing of a Wisconsin woman and may have been responsible for other murders.</p><p>The Wood County Sheriff’s Office announced that Christopher Revak was behind the death of Deidre Harm, officially closing a case that had gone unsolved for nearly two decades.</p><p>On Oct. 20, the Wood County Sheriff’s Office shared a letter from District Attorney Jonathan Barnett on Facebook stating that he would have filed charges against Revak if he were still alive.</p><p>"I consider this case closed," Barnett wrote. "I believe I had enough to charge and, if Mr. Revak were still alive, win at trial."</p><p>Harm, a 21-year-old single mother, disappeared after a night out at a downtown Wisconsin Rapids bar June 10, 2006. Her remains were discovered five months later by hunters in a wooded area near Seneca, about 5 miles from downtown, according to WSAW.</p><p>"This may provide some closure for many but won’t bring Deidre back," the Wood County Sheriff’s Office and Wisconsin Rapids Police said in a joint statement. "Our thoughts and prayers will always be with Deidre’s family."</p><p>Revak, a Wisconsin native and former EMT, died by suicide in a Missouri jail cell in July 2009, just one day after being charged with second-degree murder in the death of Rene Williams, 36, a mother of three from Mansfield, Missouri.</p><p>Williams was last seen March 13, 2007, at the Eagle Lodge bar in Ava, Missouri, where she worked. Revak was also at the bar that night, according to FOX 9.</p><p>In 2024, KCCI Des Moines reported that Iowa and Wisconsin investigators were taking a fresh look at Revak, who had long been suspected of multiple violent crimes before his death.</p><p>According to a recent documentary, police have examined whether Revak may have been connected to as many as five different homicides over a 14-year span, including the disappearance of Huisentruit.</p><p>Douglas County Sheriff Chris Degase, who investigated Williams’ case, previously told Fox News Digital that Revak’s confirmed link to Harm’s killing deepened his concerns about the former EMT’s violent history.</p><p>"When I started working on the Christopher Revak case, he was my suspect in the murder of Rene Williams," Degase said. "I didn't think it was his first go-around at it."</p><p>Degase told KY3 that forensic evidence linked Revak to Williams’ disappearance.</p><p>"We had his DNA at the scene. We had her DNA inside his truck," he said. "I think the biggest thing was that they weren’t able to find a body. They had no witnesses to come forward to say that she was dead."</p><p>Despite the lack of a body, investigators charged Revak with Williams’ murder based on DNA results. Degase said his curiosity about similar crimes led him to uncover chilling parallels.</p><p>"It wasn’t the first time Revak tried to abduct a woman in Ava," he said. "Actually, shortly after his arrest, I Google searched ‘women abducted from bars’ in all the towns that he had lived in. And when I Google searched from Wisconsin Rapids, Deidre Harm came up."</p><p>That discovery prompted Degase to reach out to Wisconsin investigators, sharing his findings and helping connect the dots between cases.</p><p>"I don’t believe in coincidences," he said. "I called the authorities out there and gave them the information I had."</p><p>Degase, who is featured in the documentary discussing the case, said Williams and Huisentruit remain missing, a detail that still haunts him. He didn’t rule out the possibility Revak could have traveled to Iowa.</p><p>"Obviously, [Jodi] wasn’t abducted from a bar, but I just thought it was odd," Degase said. </p><p>He added that Revak "had a dark side."</p><p>"We’re dealing with what’s possibly a serial killer," Degase told KY3. "During his day, he’s doing his deed to society and helping people and saving people, but there was a dark side to Chris Revak." </p><p>Revak had also been a person of interest in the 1995 disappearance of Huisentruit, a 27-year-old morning anchor for KIMT-TV in Mason City, Iowa.</p><p>Huisentruit vanished around 4 a.m. on June 27, 1995, after calling a colleague to say she was on her way to work but never arriving. Police found signs of a struggle outside her apartment, including a pair of high heels and a bent car key near her car.</p><p>She was declared legally dead in 2001, though her body has never been found.</p><p>At the time, Mason City Police said there was no evidence linking Revak to the case. However, in 2024, investigators from Wisconsin and Iowa reconnected to compare notes about him, according to FindJodi.com.</p><p>Authorities had also looked into whether Revak’s ex-wife once lived in the same house as one of the last people to see Huisentruit alive but determined she moved out six months before the anchor’s disappearance.</p><p>Despite three decades of dead ends, then-Mason City Police Chief Jeff Brinkley said in June the department continues to receive and pursue leads year-round.</p><p>"We haven’t put this down. We haven’t stopped working. We have not stopped pursuing leads and information," Brinkley told FOX 9 at the time.</p><p>In 2024, officers searched a property in Winsted, Minnesota, following a tip, though no new evidence was found. Earlier this year, part of a 2017 search warrant was also unsealed.</p><p>"We’re still hopeful the case will be solved and justice served — no matter how long it takes," Brinkley said.</p><p>Huisentruit’s family continues to hold out hope for closure.</p><p>"The pain and anguish felt by us and all who loved Jodi are immeasurable," her family wrote in a statement on the Jodi’s Hope Facebook page. "True peace will only come when Jodi is found and justice is served. We still choose to hope that one day soon it will happen."</p><p>A $50,000 reward remains in place for information leading to answers in Huisentruit’s disappearance. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Mason City Police Department or the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Stephanie Nolasco contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">A tiny island was just ranked safest in the Caribbean — here’s why travelers love it</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>If safety is at the top of your vacation checklist, one tiny Caribbean island just earned top honors for peace, calm beaches and a world-class food scene.</p><p>Anguilla, a British overseas territory just north of St. Maarten and east of the Virgin Islands, was named the safest destination in the Caribbean, according to a 2025 ranking from World Population Review, which evaluates crime, policing and political stability based on data from the Global Peace Index.</p><p>"Anguilla crime rates are the lowest in the Caribbean, with very few violent or petty crimes to mar its reputation as a tropical oasis," the report found. "Tourists can feel safe and at ease in tranquil Anguilla."</p><p>While the review noted that drug-related offenses are "moderate," it added that such crimes rarely affect visitors.</p><p>The U.S. Department of State also lists Anguilla at a Level 1 travel advisory, the lowest possible risk level, advising tourists to simply exercise normal precautions.</p><p>"Here, peace isn’t found, it’s felt," the Anguilla Tourist Board wrote on social media after the report was released. "From 33 beaches to the warmth of our community, safety is simply part of island life on Anguilla."</p><p>Following Anguilla in the World Population Review’s safety ranking were Barbados, St. Barts, Martinique, the Cayman Islands and Aruba.</p><p>John Rose, chief risk adviser for Altour, a global travel management company, said Anguilla’s ranking stems from several distinct advantages. </p><p>"Its isolation and limited access points also reduce cross-border criminal activity, and tourism is managed in a more controlled, boutique environment," Rose told Fox News Digital.</p><p>The designation is a meaningful recognition not only for traveler confidence but also from a tourism economics perspective, he added.</p><p>It’s also not the first time Anguilla has earned international praise for its appeal.</p><p>Anguilla was also recognized by Travel + Leisure’s 2025 World’s Best Awards as one of the top islands globally — and the highest-ranked in the Caribbean — earning praise for its friendly hospitality, diverse cuisine and luxury resorts.</p><p>Experts and travel blogs often highlight Anguilla as a remote, exclusive escape free of shopping malls, cruise ships and high-rises where travelers can soak up crystal clear water, white sand beaches and fresh seafood feasts.</p><p>According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the island "is noted for its easy-going atmosphere and magnificent beaches and waters."</p><p>Erin Schroeder, an Atlanta-based travel adviser and founder of Major Traveler, told Fox News Digital she agrees that Anguilla stands out as one of the best destinations in the Caribbean.</p><p>"The island of Anguilla being named the safest country in the Caribbean is an incredible win," Schroeder told Fox News Digital. "Safety in the Caribbean is a top three deciding factor when travelers are weighing various islands."</p><p>In addition to safety, travelers also seek destinations that offer easy transportation and walkability, both of which Anguilla has, she added.</p><p>"I personally love the ability to walk along the beach at night to local restaurants or exercise on the island’s flat roads knowing that it’s safe to do so," Schroeder said.</p><p>She noted that Anguilla’s exclusive, off-the-beaten-path appeal also makes it a little harder to reach, with only one direct flight option from the United States. </p><p>"There’s a high price of entry, as travelers have to fly to St. Maarten and take a boat, which costs about $115 per person each way for a shared ferry," she said.</p><p>Rose offered additional travel tips, like taking a "layered" approach to safety by reviewing local advisories, checking with hosts or advisers for up-to-date information and practicing common-sense precautions, like limiting displays of wealth and using registered transportation.</p><p>"Safety is dynamic, not static," he said. "The best travelers prepare by gathering accurate information before they go, monitoring while they’re there and staying ready to respond if something changes. That’s how you travel smart, not scared."</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Ben Stiller is opening up about the price of fame, revealing that growing up in a family of Hollywood stars gave him a front-row seat to the "dark underside" of the industry.</p><p>In a candid conversation with Howard Stern, the "Zoolander" star reflected on his complex childhood as the son of beloved comedy legends Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara.</p><p>While his upbringing gave him an inside view of show business, it also offered a glimpse at the toll fame can take behind closed doors.</p><p>"Growing up around it — and we talk [in the movie] about all those things I saw with my parents — you actually, as a kid, see the dark underside of it. The stress. The effect it has on relationships," Stiller told Stern, referring to his upcoming documentary, "Stiller &amp; Meara: Nothing Is Lost."</p><p>"You see that up close as a kid, and you still want to go into it."</p><p>Stiller, 59, explained that while his parents’ success opened doors, it also gave him an unfiltered look at the highs and lows of Hollywood life.</p><p>His new documentary explores his parents’ partnership — both professional and personal — and how their relationship helped define his own sense of humor and ambition.</p><p>Despite seeing the struggles that come with fame, Stiller said he never doubted his calling.</p><p>"If you have the passion, you do it," he shared.</p><p>The actor and filmmaker, known for hit movies like "Meet the Parents" and "Tropic Thunder," admitted that revisiting his parents’ journey through the lens of the documentary taught him as much about himself as it did about them.</p><p>Stiller made his comments after he revealed the "worst decision" he ever made was cutting his daughter, Ella, out of his 2013 film "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," which he both directed and starred in.</p><p>"I cut you out of ‘Secret Life of Walter Mitty.’ It's probably the worst decision I ever made in my life," the 59-year-old told his daughter, 23, according to People magazine.</p><p>Ella Stiller admitted the decision made sense creatively, saying the scene where she was meant to play Mitty’s daughter "didn’t really make sense in the movie."</p><p>But for Stiller, the choice carried more weight. </p><p>"For me, it kind of goes deeper," he explained. "What it relates to is my own issues with my own obsessions with my work, or perfectionism."</p><p>His documentary, "Stiller &amp; Meara: Nothing Is Lost," focuses on his parents, a mid-century comedy duo who later became sitcom regulars on "Seinfeld," "Sex and the City" and "The King of Queens."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Jenna Ortega turned heads with her latest red carpet look at the InStyle Imagemaker Awards.</p><p>The 23-year-old "Wednesday" star posed for photos at the event in a sheer purple dress with a plunging neckline and lace detailing on the bodice. The skirt featured a thigh-high slit, and her nude underwear could be seen through the slightly darker shade of purple material.</p><p>She paired the look with a big fuzzy burgundy jacket, silver high-heeled shoes, a drop necklace and a ring on her right hand. She kept her hair and makeup simple, opting for a dark lip with her signature bleached eyebrows and wore her hair down in a center part.</p><p>Ortega attended the awards show to honor her stylist, Enrique Melendez, who received the Future of Fashion Award. In her speech, she credited Melendez as being "one of the first people who ever made me feel seen or heard."</p><p>"Growing up in an industry like this, you learn to become the puppet and stand there and do what you're told," Ortega said in her speech, per InStyle. "He always took everything I said with the utmost importance and respect and care."</p><p>The "Beetlejuice Beetlejuice" star previously spoke about her career as a child actress, telling The New York Times in August 2024 that "child acting is strange," and she could understand why her "parents felt so hesitant about it."</p><p>She went on to explain that she believes she would have been a different person had she never started acting, adding, "Children aren’t supposed to be working like that. They are supposed to be climbing trees and drawing and going to school.</p><p>"When I first started auditioning, we’d spend hours in these casting offices, and we met so many strange and intense personalities. It could be stage parents, it could be producers that really made me fearful of other people for a while, and I think that’s when I started to become more introverted," the "Scream" star said. </p><p>"It was such a joy to be able to get back in the car at the end of the day and do my homework, because I was still going to public school at the time, and listen to my mom talk and catch up with my siblings at home."</p><p>Ortega got her big break in the Disney Channel show "Stuck in the Middle," playing the inventive middle child in a large family, but gained international fame playing Wednesday Addams in the Netflix series, "Wednesday."</p><p>The role boosted her star power and earned her nominations at the Emmy, SAG, Golden Globe and Critics Choice Awards.</p><p>While not nominated at the 2025 Emmy Awards, Ortega attended as a presenter alongside "Wednesday" co-star Catherine Zeta-Jones in yet another jaw-dropping outfit.

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump on Saturday said he won’t waste time meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin again unless a deal on the war in Ukraine is likely.</p><p>"I'm going to have to know that we're going to make a deal," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One after taking off from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, when asked about arranging a meeting with Putin. "I'm not going to be wasting my time. I've always had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin, but this has been very disappointing."</p><p>He said he thought the war in Ukraine would have been resolved "long before" the peace deal between Israel and Hamas.</p><p>"We have Azerbaijan and Armenia. That was very tough," Trump added, referring to the peace summit he hosted at the White House between the two countries.</p><p>"In fact, Putin told me on the phone, he said, ‘Boy, that was amazing,’ because everybody tried to get that done, and they couldn't. I got it done. You had others. If you look at India and Pakistan, I could say almost any one of the deals that I've already done, I thought would have been more difficult than Russia, than Ukraine, but it didn't work out that way.</p><p>"There's a lot of hatred between the two, between [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy and Putin, there's tremendous hatred."</p><p>Earlier this week, Trump said he had called off a planned meeting with Putin in Budapest to discuss the war because he saw it as a "waste of time."</p><p>Trump announced the Budapest meeting last week, saying it could happen within the next two weeks.</p><p>He also announced sanctions against Russia this week.</p><p>Trump and Putin last met in Alaska in August, but no deal was reached following the summit.</p><p>Trump met with Zelenskyy last week at the White House, where he seemingly denied Ukraine’s request for Tomahawk long-range missiles. </p><p>The president also said that, in his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week, he wants a "complete [trade] deal." </p><p>"I want our farmers to be taken care of, and he wants things also," Trump said. "We're going to be talking about fentanyl, of course. Fentanyl is killing a lot of people, a lot people. It comes from China, and we'll be talking a lot about that.

<div class="article-title">TPUSA chapter gained 100 new members rapidly at Texas university after Charlie Kirk assassination</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Turning Point USA (TPUSA) field representative in Texas cited "unprecedented growth" of TPUSA chapters after Charlie Kirk’s assassination.</p><p>"It has been unprecedented," Paige Rasmussen told Fox News Digital.</p><p>"In such dark times, we weren't really sure, you know, initially, ‘What do we do now? Where do we go from here?’ And it became apparent very quickly where we go from here and that's up, and it has not slowed down," Rasmussen said.</p><p>Rasmussen covers the Lone Star territory for TPUSA.</p><p>A field representative’s job is to recruit students and host events. Some of their responsibilities entail administrative tasks. Rasmussen said her job is split between being on campus with students and answering phone calls to make sure events are planned for the students.</p><p>In the wake of Kirk’s death, more students flocked to TPUSA chapters, Rasmussen reported.</p><p>"It's just been growing and growing," Rasmussen told Fox News Digital. "I mean, we're seeing hundreds of thousands of students wanting to get involved, thousands of chapters starting at the high school and college level. </p><p>"So, you know, it's something that you can't really explain other than its courage and its faith and it's time for students to stand up. And they are doing such an amazing job at having that courage, especially on their college campuses."</p><p>Rasmussen presides over the University of Texas at Tyler, where a new chapter was approved by the university earlier this month.</p><p>"It was pretty quiet for a while, but after Charlie passed, we gained almost 100 members. So, it was really cool," Reece Cooper, the president of the TPUSA chapter at UT-Tyler told Fox News Digital.</p><p>The chapter started in January but was not officially recognized by the university until this month. Cooper said the group struggled to find a faculty advisor to sponsor the organization due to the overt political implications of TPUSA being associated with conservative politics. Jonathan Roncancio, the vice president of the chapter, said a majority of the faculty are more left-leaning and that the group did not try hard enough to secure sponsorship from an advisor.</p><p>UT-Tyler officials told Fox News Digital the chapter applied for registration Sept. 19, and the university worked with the students to facilitate the process. The chapter was approved Oct. 9.</p><p>The chapter eventually found an advisor and was approved after Kirk's death, which dominated headlines and launched TPUSA into prominence.</p><p>Roncancio added that they noticed the growth in a GroupMe chat that involved the members.</p><p>"We had a lot of people join GroupMe. It went from around 10 people to 120 people overnight, and that was obviously due to the interest in Turning Point. People were seeing it on the news and wanted to learn more about it. And so we've had more people come to meetings and come up to us wondering what we're doing on campus and just what's happening," Roncancio told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Kirk built a following over the past five years touring the country to debate college students on culture war issues such as gender ideology, racial divisions and the merits of Christian and American values in general.</p><p>Kirk, who was assassinated while speaking at a college event in Utah, left behind a wife, Erika, and two young children. Ever since his death, TPUSA, an organization founded by Kirk, has received overwhelming support. </p><p>Rasmussen projects further growth because a revival is sweeping the country, inspiring young people to stand up for what they believe in. </p><p>"I don't see it slowing down because I don't think this is a situation where people are just seeing it online and want to join something that's popular," she said.</p><p>"I think this is a revival, and this is where students and just people in general, whether they're out of school, are feeling this conviction in their souls that it's time to stand up and be courageous about their values and their beliefs. And so I'm just happy to be with these students and happy to help them and be a part of the movement."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">EXCLUSIVE: Franklin Graham’s Samaritan’s Purse launches 767 airlift of food, aid for Gaza families amid war</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Rev. Franklin Graham’s Christian relief organization Samaritan’s Purse launched its inaugural 767 cargo aircraft Saturday, carrying 290,000 packets of vitamin-fortified food, thousands of blankets and solar lights for women and children in Gaza. It was the humanitarian ministry's latest aid mission to the war-torn region.</p><p>In an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital, Graham said the relief effort comes amid continuing instability.</p><p>"Gaza is a very volatile place — it is still dangerous. There are more than 2 million people there who need help," Graham said. "What Hamas did was horrendous. It was a massacre. Not only did they take 251 innocent civilians hostage from Israel on October 7, they have also held the entire population of Gaza hostage for 18 years. Hamas has got to go."</p><p>He added the plane’s mission was driven by a desire to show compassion in a time of crisis.</p><p>"Today we are taking over 290,000 packets of food loaded with protein and fortified with vitamins, as well as thousands of solar lights and blankets for families who have lost so much," he said. "Pray with us for the people in Gaza that this cargo will be helping."</p><p>The shipment departed Saturday morning from the organization’s Airlift Response Center in Greensboro, North Carolina. Before takeoff, Graham joined staff and flight crew on the tarmac, bowing in prayer beside the towering white jet that marks a new chapter in the relief group’s aviation fleet.</p><p>Edward Graham, Samaritan’s Purse COO and Franklin Graham’s youngest son, called Gaza "one of the most challenging places to work in the world" and thanked staff for serving despite danger.</p><p>"The fact that Samaritan’s Purse is able to help there and show the love of God to the people of Gaza is something that only He could do," Edward Graham said. "I’m thankful for our staff who are willing to go and that their hearts are broken and pierced by the things that break the heart of Jesus Christ."</p><p>The group’s latest airlift comes nearly two years after the outbreak of war, which has left families across Gaza without consistent access to food, electricity or medicine. </p><p>Samaritan’s Purse began working in the region immediately after the fighting erupted, sending doctors, nurses and emergency aid. Since then, the organization says it has delivered more than 223 tons of food and distributed over 1 million rations to civilians, while medical teams have treated more than 1,700 patients.</p><p>This newest shipment continues the group's work with a particular focus on children and women left vulnerable by the ongoing conflict. The cargo included not only food but 12,000 solar-powered lanterns to provide light in communities where power has been cut and 12,000 blankets for families who lost homes or belongings.</p><p>The effort reflects a long-standing strategy by the North Carolina-based relief group to use its fleet of planes to deliver supplies to hard-hit areas around the world. In recent years, Samaritan’s Purse has deployed mobile field hospitals to Ukraine, distributed emergency shelter kits in Sudan and helped earthquake survivors in Haiti. </p><p>The addition, the wide-body 767 gives the ministry greater reach, allowing it to deliver larger relief shipments on fewer flights.</p><p>Franklin Graham said that kind of investment was necessary given the scope of human suffering seen in Gaza and Israel. </p><p>"This is about showing God’s love to people who are hurting," he said. "It’s about letting them know they are not forgotten."</p><p>The organization has also worked in Israel, where communities remain shaken from Hamas’ Oct. 7 terror attack and the months of war that followed. Samaritan’s Purse has pledged 42 ambulances, 28 of them armored, to Magen David Adom, Israel’s emergency medical service, and is supporting 11 major construction projects, including ambulance response stations and community centers equipped with bomb shelters.</p><p>Former Arkansas Gov. and Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee praised the effort Saturday, writing on X that Samaritan’s Purse is "the most efficient and effective disaster response organization on the planet."The 767 is expected to deliver the food and supplies on the ground in Gaza in the coming days. Samaritan’s Purse said additional relief flights are planned as conditions allow.</p><p>"This is not a one-time effort," Franklin Graham said. "As long as people are suffering, we will continue to go."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Finance expert asks why NBA figures allegedly developed illegal gambling ties despite million-dollar fortunes</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier and Damon Jones were arrested Thursday morning as part of FBI probes into alleged illegal gambling with ties to La Cosa Nostra crime families. </p><p>The allegations come despite both Billups and Rozier having made over $100 million each in career earnings, while Jones has made around $20 million.</p><p>With that much money made, it is fair to wonder how the NBA figures allegedly got wrapped up in the scandal.</p><p></p><p>"How could they possibly get into a situation where they would do this? Their lifetime income was somewhere in the vicinity of $150 million. For most people, you couldn't spend $150 million in your lifetime," Notre Dame finance professor Richard Sheehan said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.</p><p>Billups is accused of making $50,000 playing in at least one poker game, while Rozier allegedly counted up "tens of thousands" of dollars after his friend’s bets after Rozier’s early exit from a game.</p><p>Sheehan said the net worth for Billups and Rozier that he has seen, which were much lower than their career earnings, did not add up.</p><p>"The numbers that I had seen in terms of their net worth, though, were in the vicinity of $35 and $40 million. Still, not bad at all, but I look at the $150 million in income, subtract off taxes, subtract off expenses, whatever. And just as a finance professor, I look at that and say, ‘Their wealth should be double $35 or $40 million.’ Easy, should be double that. And it's not," Sheehan said.</p><p>Sheehan blamed the possibility of "posses" that hang on to athletes, resulting in the athletes giving them money.</p><p>"Many people in athletes’ orbs would basically view them as walking ATMs," Sheehan said.</p><p>He also speculated about the possibility of bad financial decisions from advisors and attorneys for the large discrepancy between earnings and net worth.</p><p>"The other possibility is simply that, that they've had dealings with unsavory characters like the mafia, that they may not have known about at the time and that's led them into compromising positions where they feel that they need to do something," Sheehan said, effectively reiterating the allegations of the poker scheme.</p><p>There is one final possibility, though: Plain stupidity and greed.</p><p>"'I've got $40 million in the bank. But, you know, if I had $41 million, I'd feel a little better.’ If you can do that honestly, then that's one story. If you need to cut corners, then it's just really stupid because your future income, in terms of sports, your future income goes to zero, and you may end up spending a fair amount of time in a jail cell," Sheehan said.</p><p>Billups, Rozier and Jones, the latter of whom is a defendant in both cases, were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The NBA announced Billups and Rozier were placed on immediate leave from their teams, "and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities."</p><p>"The integrity of our game remains our top priority," the NBA said.</p><p>Attorneys for both Billups and Rozier have denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>"Anyone who knows Chauncey Billups knows he is a man of integrity; men of integrity do not cheat and defraud others," a statement from attorney Chris Heywood said.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>It was less town hall talk and more kung fu theater.</p><p>A local election candidate is making waves for a bizarre protest at a township meeting this week when he dressed up in martial arts gear and unleashed a series of flying kicks and punched through several of his own protest signs.</p><p>The man, identified in previous theatrical stunts as Will Thilly, is running as an independent for the Cranford Township Committee in New Jersey and has been railing against the mayor on taxes, development policy and civic unity.</p><p>About 45 minutes into the streamed meeting, Thilly approached the podium in his blue-colored gear, yellow belt and black headband and began clapping.</p><p>He then broke out singing "Eye of the Tiger" and asked the bemused crowd to join in.</p><p>That’s when two helpers on either side of the floor unfurled a sign that said "Unfair Taxes," and Thilly proceeded to kung fu kick through it. One man in the crowd can be seen laughing, and another man held his head in his hands, while a despondent elderly couple got up and left.</p><p>But Thilly and his crew weren’t finished here.</p><p>His pals unfurl three other signs that said, "Closing Our Pools," "Overdevelopment" and "Divisiveness," with Thilly kung fu kicking through each of them.</p><p>The two men then unfurl another sign that says "Let Love Rule," which was also adorned with hearts.</p><p>"Mr. Thilly, please address your comments to the township committee," Mayor Terrence Curran can be heard saying.</p><p>Unfazed, Thilly then says, "This is love." He walked toward it and the two men embrace him, wrapping him in the sign.</p><p>Moments later, Thilly took the microphone and aired his grievances to the mayor, accusing him and the township committee of mishandling a controversial 30-year PILOT tax-exemption deal for a 250-unit apartment complex.</p><p>"You also voted for the 30-year tax exemption and PILOT at 750 Walnut on Oct. 8 last year. Then, this July, you said you never voted for that deal, that I was lying," Thilly said.</p><p>"The fact that you, our mayor, cannot remember that you voted for the single largest financial deal and loss in our town history is grounds for that agreement’s annulment. … This is the real reason our taxes are going up so much."</p><p>He alleged that the agreement costs the town millions in lost revenue and contributes to rising property taxes, claiming officials have "censored" meetings and canceled a candidates’ debate "for the first time in history."</p><p>Fox News Digital requested comment from Curran but did not immediately receive a response.</p><p>Thilly isn’t new to theatrics. Last month, a video of the independent candidate breakdancing at another meeting went viral, drawing more than 1.6 million views, according to CBS News New York.</p><p>In that appearance, Thilly moonwalked across the floor and performed a backspin before using his allotted five minutes to complain about rising taxes, according to CBS News New York.</p><p>"We were told the referendum was gonna bring it up for an average household about $400, I think, and mine went up like 900 bucks," Thilly said, per the outlet.</p><p>After his speech, he moonwalked out.</p><p>Curran dismissed that stunt as "completely a distraction," per CBS.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Dakota Johnson couldn't care less what people have to say about her fashion choices.</p><p>During a recent interview with Vogue Germany for its cover story, the 36-year-old "Materialists" star was asked if she's ever nervous "about whether a naked dress might be too sexy," and she didn't hold back in her response.</p><p>"I really don't care," she told the outlet. "I've been able to wear some of the most beautiful dresses, and I feel beautiful in them, so I wear them."</p><p>Johnson's love for the naked dress dates back to 2021, when she arrived at the Venice Film Festival in a custom sheer Gucci gown dripping with jewels and silver fringe. She then made waves when she wore a sheer black gown with spider web designs at the 2024 premiere of "Madame Web."</p><p>She credits her mom, actress Melanie Griffith, with giving her the confidence to wear these gowns, saying Griffith "was just very open about the topic of bodies."</p><p>"She taught us how to take care of our bodies and love them, and that our bodies are beautiful," she told Vogue Germany. "And I think that's something really important for a young girl because we're constantly told that we're not good enough."</p><p>The actress called the confidence her mom instilled in her "a huge gift she gave me," noting "it can really break you" when you are "not told from a young age by the woman you look up to the most that you're perfect and smart and special and strong and brave."</p><p>Most recently, Johnson wore two revealing gowns to different red carpets. She first wore a sheer black Gucci dress in floral-embroidered lace, which showed off her black bra and underwear, while at the Kering Foundation's Caring for Women dinner in September.</p><p>She then went braless in a long-sleeve blue Gucci gown featuring a high neckline and sheer lace bodice at the Zurich Film Festival later that month.</p><p>"Sometimes those dresses look good on me. But there are also some we've tried on that didn't look good at all. It depends on the shape, the finish, the color and everything else. So, if I find a beautiful dress that I feel comfortable in, of course I want to wear it. And it's fun to wear a sexy dress."</p><p>The "Fifty Shades of Grey" star's daring style has gotten her in trouble a few times. Most recently, Johnson wore a black minidress with a plunging neckline while on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon," a choice she instantly regretted.</p><p>"Oh God," Johnson said, when she realized the dress showed more than she bargained for when she sat down. "This is the wrong outfit."</p><p>After asking host Jimmy Fallon to let her know "if there’s a problem" and later asking for a blanket to cover up, Fallon gave her a tissue to place in her cleavage.</p><p>"That’s perfect. No one will even know the difference," said Fallon. "You look great."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>One person is dead and six others are injured after a shooting Saturday night on the campus of Lincoln University of Pennsylvania, the Chester County district attorney said.</p><p>District Attorney Christopher de Barrena-Sarobe said during an overnight news conference that seven people were shot during Homecoming festivities at the university.

<div class="article-title">Man confesses to cold case murder: "A serial killer who's only killed once"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>When Stephan Smerk called Fairfax County Police Detective Melissa Wallace on Sept. 7, 2023, she was shocked to hear what he had to say.</p><p>"He says, I'm at the police department to turn myself in," Wallace told "48 Hours" correspondent Anne-Marie Green, in "Closing the Cold Case of Robin Lawrence," now streaming on Paramount+. "And I said, turn yourself in for what?" </p><p>Smerk, a married 52-year-old father of two living in Niskayuna, New York, was calling to confess to the 30-year-old cold case murder of<span class="link"> Robin Warr Lawrence</span>. </p><p>"A million things start going through my mind," Wallace said. "The adrenaline was pumping so hard because the reality hit … of what this means and that we're getting ready to close this case."</p>
<p>Robin Warr Lawrence, an artist and mother, was brutally murdered in her home in Springfield, Virginia, in 1994. For two days, her daughter Nicole, just 2 years old at the time, roamed the house alone before her mother's body was discovered. And for three decades after that, detectives tried to figure out who could have done this to Robin. </p>
<p>"Who would do such a thing? Why?" said Mary Warr Cowans, Robin's sister. "I remember thinking at the funeral, Robin's killer could be in this room with us. We didn't know."</p><p>It took decades, but eventually the family would get their answers. DNA evidence — in the form of blood left on a washcloth — had been found at the crime scene back in 1994, and at the time it had turned up no matches when investigators ran it through CODIS — the FBI's national database. Years went by and new techniques were developed, including a process called genetic genealogy.</p>
<p>In genetic genealogy, a suspect's DNA is used to find their relatives. Then investigators research those relatives' family trees until a potential person of interest is found — someone who would have been the right age and in the right place at the right time to commit the crime. Parabon NanoLabs, a DNA technology company that often works with law enforcement, did not have high hopes for solving Robin's case using this technique because the database matches were very distant.</p><p>"Parabon gave us a solvability rate of zero on the case," said Wallace.</p>
<p>Fairfax County Police Department volunteer Liz, who asked that her last name not be used, thought she'd take a crack at it anyway. The process proved difficult. "I was ready to give up a number of times," Liz told "48 Hours." "But I kept thinking, well, I'll just finish this or just do this one more thing."</p><p>After three years of doing just one more thing, Liz came up with a possible suspect. He'd lived in Virginia in 1994 and would have been around the right age to commit the murder. His name was Stephan Smerk.</p><p>"I wasn't very hopeful at the time," Wallace said. "I was just looking at this guy's background. I'm thinking, there is no way."</p><p>Smerk had a completely clean record, without so much as a speeding ticket. He worked as a computer programmer in suburban Niskayuna.</p><p>Though they had their doubts, Detectives Melissa Wallace and Jon Long took the trip up to Niskayuna to talk to Smerk. Their goal was to get his DNA, to see if he was related to the person who had left their DNA at the crime scene – or if he was that person.</p><p>"He comes to the door right away," Wallace said. "All we said is we are detectives from Fairfax County, Virginia, and we're looking into a cold case from the 90s."</p><p>Smerk, detectives say, had no reaction. "Stone-faced," said Long. Smerk gave his DNA willingly, and Wallace and Long went back to their hotel. Then Wallace got that call. </p>
<p>"I was freaking out," Wallace said. "I run down to [Long's] room, while I'm still on the phone, and I'm banging on his door, and he comes to the door, like, what is the problem? I'm like, we got to go to the police department." </p>
<p>When they met Smerk at the Niskayuna Police Department, officers had taken him into custody and he was ready to talk. Wallace and Long sat him down in an interrogation room, and without much prompting, Smerk confessed to the murder of Robin Warr Lawrence. He had gone to Robin's home that night in 1994, he told them, for no other reason than wanting to kill someone.</p><p>"I knew that I was going kill somebody," Smerk told the detectives. "I did not know who I was going to kill." At the time, Smerk was in the military and posted at a base nearby and was familiar with Robin Warr Lawrence's neighborhood because a friend had stayed there. He said he had no idea who lived in Robin's house. </p><p>"There could have been 50 people in that house. I don't know. They could have all had guns and shot me dead. I wasn't even thinking about that." All Smerk was thinking about, he told detectives, was killing. He said he had compulsions that he couldn't control.</p><p>"I honestly believe that if it wasn't for my wife and my kids, I probably would be a serial killer," Smerk said. "I am a serial killer who's only killed once."</p>
<p>"It's such a shocking statement," Wallace told "48 Hours." "It makes no sense. You know, if you're a serial killer, you don't kill once. But, on the other hand, he was very candid and open and honest throughout the rest of the interview. So, it could be true that he has only killed one person."</p><p>Is it possible for someone with the impulses of a serial killer to kill just once? Former FBI profiler Mary Ellen O'Toole says it can happen.</p>
<p>"We have learned over the years with cases like <span class="link">BTK</span> and the <span class="link">Golden State Killer</span> and other cases where they do stop," she explained. "The compulsions don't go away … they tell us that they rechannel it. They put it into a different activity. So that activity can be something that is less than murder, but it could involve, for example, Peeping Tom behavior, autoerotic behavior … but you don't just cut those urges off. Something has to replace them." </p><p>Smerk had zero incidents on his record. O'Toole says it's possible he never committed another crime, but she doubts the ideas in his head went away. She said she'd like to know more about his ideation in order to determine whether he could be a threat in the future.</p><p>"That ideation that really led to the murder in the first place, that would be troubling to me until I knew a lot more about that. What triggered it? What are you doing with it now? Don't tell me it's never there. Don't tell me that it just went out the window after you committed that murder." </p><p>In his interview, Smerk expressed no remorse for what he had done. When asked if he had anything he'd like to tell Robin's family, he replied, "How do I say this? I know you're recording … I don't feel anything for the family. …I feel bad that I did it because I knew someday my personal freedom would be affected."</p><p>Smerk pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 70 years in prison. He will be eligible for parole in 2037, when he is 65. Robin's family said they are glad to have closure as long as Smerk spends the rest of his life behind bars, but the consequences of his actions will never leave them.</p><p>"It helped to know that a person was found and being held responsible," Warr Cowans said in her statement to the judge at Smerk's sentencing, "but it didn't help to know what he did to [Robin] and how she suffered … it doesn't help and it doesn't bring her back. She would have been in our lives for the past thirty years. But that was taken from us."</p><p>She told "48 Hours" that for a long time she lived in fear, not knowing who had committed this horrible crime.</p>
<p>"I actually felt afraid at home, in my bed," she said. "Thinking about someone just from out of the blue could show up from anywhere and kill you in your house ... That's just a scary thought that you're not safe anywhere."</p><p>"It's scary," echoed Long. "From a community perspective, that's like your worst nightmare. Like, that's the reason why you tell like your loved ones to make sure that your doors are locked at night. He is the boogeyman." </p>

<p>Cold case detectives Melissa Wallace and Jon Long of the Fairfax County Police Department began reviewing <span class="link">Robin Lawrence</span>'s murder case in April 2021. They were struck by the sheer violence of the attack on the 37-year-old Springfield, Virginia, mother. </p><p><strong>Det. Jon Long</strong>: … that's like your worst nightmare.</p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: It looked brutal.</p><p><strong>Det. Jon Long</strong>: … that's the reason why you tell your loved ones to make sure that your doors are locked at night … he is … the boogeyman. </p><h2>Investigating the murder of Robin Warr Lawrence</h2><p>On Nov. 20, 1994, Robin's friend Laurie Lindberg had entered her home to check on her and saw blood on the bedroom walls and Robin's 2-year-old daughter Nicole wandering around. Alarmed, Lindberg called 911 – and then rushed the little girl to the hospital. Although Nicole did not appear hurt, she had undergone a liver transplant after she was born, and her health was fragile.</p>
<p><strong>Laurie Lindberg</strong>: Because, of course, she's taking immunosuppressive medications. … I mean, this is life-saving medication. … She needs to have it.</p><p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: Because you don't know how long she's been in that house by herself. </p><p><strong>Laurie Lindberg</strong>: Right.</p><p>Lead crime scene Detective Mark Garman was one of the first on site. </p>
<p>According to Garman, who photographed the evidence, the intruder came through a window off the back deck — the one Lindberg had used to get inside. He entered the house the same way. </p><p><strong>Det. Mark Garman</strong>: I had no idea what the scene looked like until I walked around the corner in — into the master bedroom.</p><p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: Tell me the state that Robin was in when you saw her.</p><p><strong>Det. Mark Garman</strong>: … very damaged, a lot of knife wounds, severe gaping knife wound in her neck … unbelievable number of defensive wounds on her hands, knife wounds in her back, on her legs. </p><p>He says signs of a struggle were obvious in the room.</p><p><strong>Det. Mark Garman</strong>: This is the phone that was on the floor, um, near Mrs. Lawrence. </p><p><strong>Det. Mark Garman:</strong> The phone cord was cut.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Mark Garman</strong>: She was assaulted in the bed and then fought her way outta the bed, and, um, continued to fight and struggle …</p><p>Garman says one of the first things that stood out were bloody tissues, scattered around the house and near Robin's body. He believes it was Robin's daughter, Nicole, who left them behind — trying to help her mother<em>.</em></p><p><strong>Det. Mark Garman</strong>: … even at that age, kids know what blood is and bloods come from … wounds and cuts. And they know that mom puts, tissues on them or Band-Aids. … I think she was trying to stop the blood.</p><p>And there was another heart-wrenching discovery: empty baby bottles had been left around her mother's body.</p><p><strong>Det. Mark Garman</strong>: Having kids … When they got hungry, they brought you your baby bottle. … And that's what I'm thinking. … Nicole would've taken it to mom. </p><p>While investigators processed the scene, officers at the hospital asked Lindberg to call Robin's parents. </p><p><strong>Laurie Lindberg</strong>: Robin's dad answered. … I think I said Robin is dead. … But what I remember is, um, Jessie, her mom, must have just been in the — or overheard, cause … She was just wailing, just a sort of primal anguish. … that was really horrible. … That's probably the most horrible thing that's ever happened to me  is calling (crying).</p>
<p>Robin's father, Robert Warr Sr., a World War II veteran and now 101 years old, says he tried to forget that call but one memory has never left him.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Warr Sr</strong>.: My granddaughter was … right next to where she was murdered. … I'll never forget that. Never. </p><p>He had to break the news to his surviving children, including his daughter Mary Warr Cowans and his son Robert Warr Jr. </p><p><strong>Mary Warr Cowans</strong>: … after the words "Robin is dead," I — it was like —</p><p><strong>Robert Warr Jr</strong>.: A nightmare.</p><p><strong>Mary Warr Cowans</strong>: Yeah. You're just like — your world shattered.</p><p>Cowans says, in those first few days, they didn't have a clear picture of what had happened to their sister. </p><p><strong>Mary Warr Cowans</strong>: … the details were very sketchy and slow to come andthe police … asked, well, do you know anybody who had a grudge or something against Robin? And of course, the answer is no.</p>
<p>Robin was a gifted artist with a fine arts degree from Carnegie Melon University. After college, she was selected to mold the first medal for The Martin Luther King Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize, which was awarded to Rosa Parks. </p>
<p><strong>Mary Warr Cowans</strong>: That was a big deal. And for my parents who grew up in Memphis, Tennessee … during Jim Crow and they could not ride in the front of the bus, they could not go to the zoo except on Tuesdays. … that was a big deal. </p><p>Robin's father says his daughter's accomplishments were his greatest source of pride. </p><p><strong>Robert Warr Sr</strong>.: She was a powerful lady in this world … Her drawings are not just paintings, they are powerful. </p><p>Lindberg first met Robin in ballet class.</p><p><strong>Laurie Lindberg</strong>: I was like, oh my God, this woman's beautiful. … But what … was really fun about Robin was she's very personable, very fun loving, just very down to earth.</p><p>Lindberg and Robin shared an apartment in Washington D.C. around the time Robin was dating her future husband, Ollie. Lindberg says they were a great match.</p>
<p><strong>Laurie Lindberg</strong>: Ollie … he has a very calm and kind demeanor and you kind of feel very confident around him, very at ease with him. </p><p>The couple were married on New Year's Eve 1989. Three years later, they welcomed their daughter, Nicole. At the time of her death, Robin was working in advertising. Ollie Lawrence, who was away on a business trip in the Bahamas, was an executive at an airline. </p><p><strong>Mary Warr Cowans</strong>: Well, I think they had a relatively what I call normal family life<strong>. </strong>… they were working on doing home improvements, getting the yard fixed up.</p><p>Now that home with so much promise, was an active crime scene. </p><p><strong>Det. Jon Long</strong>: There were valuables that were in the bedroom. There was cash. There was jewelry. … There wasn't … anything stolen …</p><p>Investigators suspected Robin was killed by someone she knew.</p><p><strong>Det. Jon Long</strong>: They started looking at the family dynamic. They started looking at the marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: Was Ollie cooperative?</p><p><strong>Det. Jon Long</strong>: He was. </p><p>But as authorities dug further, they learned something. Ollie had been having an affair with a colleague.</p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: Then what does that mean? … you think, oh how convenient, the weekend you go out of town for three days, your wife is brutally murdered.</p><h2>The case goes cold</h2><p><strong>Mary Warr Cowans</strong>: It just was surreal. It really was like, for me, walking in a —- through a dream state. … cause you just can't make sense of it.</p><p>Just three days after what would have been Robin's 38th birthday on Nov. 26, 1994, her family and friends gathered for her funeral. </p><p><strong>Mary Warr Cowans</strong>: We were still very much just bewildered and lost. </p>
<p>Cowans says Robin's injuries were so severe, the family had a closed casket. </p><p><strong>Mary Warr Cowans</strong>: … that was hard for me cause I had never got a chance to see her one last time. I always wanted to be able to say goodbye and see her. (emotional)</p><p>As Robin's family mourned her death, investigators pieced together a timeline and determined that the last time anyone had heard from Robin was around 6 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 18.</p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: We believe Robin was killed around 9:30-ish.</p>
<p>Her body was discovered two days later. Investigators zeroed in on her husband, Ollie, who they had discovered was having an affair. They followed up on his alibi. </p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: The detectives flew down to the Bahamas, confirmed that he was on the flight he was supposed to be on. He was at the hotel he was supposed to be at.</p><p>Detectives also interviewed Ollie's lover but found no evidence she was involved. Robin's sister and brother were surprised to learn about the affair but they say they never believed Ollie had anything to do with Robin's murder. </p>
<p><strong>Mary Warr Cowans</strong>: I never thought that Ollie — that he harmed her. </p><p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: And how about you? Did it ever cross your mind maybe he's involved in this somehow? </p><p><strong>Robert Warr</strong> <strong>Jr.</strong>: No, I didn't think that. He's not that type of person. </p><p>Ollie chose not to talk to "48 Hours" about his experience. Investigators didn't have much else to go on. The killer left no fingerprints – but something had caught crime scene detective Garman's eye while he was documenting the bathroom. </p><p><strong>Det. Mark Garman</strong>: … on the towel rod to the sliding tub door. There's a washcloth. </p><p><strong>Det. Mark Garman</strong>: I do notice a small stain on this towel right here. … Small brownish stain. </p><p>That brown stain turned out to be blood and authorities extracted DNA from it. It didn't match anyone close to the case, including Ollie or the woman he had had a relationship with. Detectives believed it belonged to Robin's killer and uploaded it to the FBI's national database, CODIS. </p>
<p>But CODIS also returned no matches. And with no new leads, the investigation stalled.</p><p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: How much did the adults tell you? </p><p><strong>Lauren Ovans</strong>: Nothing.</p><p>Mary Warr Cowans' daughter, Lauren Ovans, was just 8 years old when her Aunt Robin was killed. </p><p><strong>Lauren Ovans</strong>: I remember her being angelic.</p><p>She says even though her family avoided the topic, she could feel the void Robin's murder left behind. </p><p><strong>Lauren Ovans</strong>: Out of all of my family members, she was the most like me. … So everybody always called me Robin. … I just knew that they were still thinking of her. </p>
<p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: Can you describe what you lost when you lost Robin? </p><p><strong>Lauren Ovans</strong>: I think I lost an extension of myself because … she was the one who just taught me to be comfortable with who I was. So you – you — I lost a piece of me. </p><p>Ovans says she stayed close with her cousin Nicole who rarely spoke about her mother.</p><p><strong>Lauren Ovans</strong>: I think she didn't know much about her mother. … So there wasn't really much to share. And I didn't want to ever bring it up because I didn't want to make her anxious or make her nervous. Um, it was better just left unsaid.</p><p>The family eventually resigned themselves to the idea that the case may never be solved. </p><p><strong>Mary Warr Cowans</strong>: When my mother died, I, that was kind of like, well, she went to her grave not knowing what happened to her child. And — and at that point I said, well, just, I have to just kinda let it go. … I have to let it go. </p><p>Then, decades later in 2019, investigators turned to Parabon NanoLabs, a DNA technology company, hoping genetic genealogy could identify Robin's killer. Ellen Greytak is the director of bioinformatics at Parabon.</p>
<p><strong>Ellen Greytak</strong>: We take DNA from a crime scene. … We upload it to GED Match and to Family Tree DNA, which are two databases. … And what they give us back is … people in our database … who share DNA with your unknown person. </p><p>Greytak says that while their analysis showed Robin's killer likely had European ancestry, tracing him through his relatives proved nearly impossible. </p><p><strong>Ellen Greytak</strong>: So in this case, the — the database matches were just really distant. They only shared little, tiny pieces of DNA, which means that their shared ancestor with our unknown person was pretty far back in time. And that means that those people had a lot of descendants today.</p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: Parabon gave us a solvability rate of zero on the case, and essentially said, you do not have the time nor the money … to get it moving forward …</p><p>Investigators say they could have walked away. But Liz, an amateur genealogist and volunteer with the police department — who asked that her last name not be used — offered to take on the case in her spare time for free. </p><p><strong>Liz</strong>: I just felt I wanted to give something back to the community. … And I believed that I could actually be helpful in solving some of these cases.</p><p>Investigators gave Liz everything Parabon had uncovered about the suspect's ethnicity.</p>
<p><strong>Liz</strong>: … it was about half Eastern European, about 25 percent Irish. Another 25 percent was a combination of I think English and Italian and Scandinavian. </p><p>Along with a list of cousins who shared his DNA. </p><p><strong>Liz</strong>: And so what I got … was … approximately 1,500 cousins.</p><p><strong>Liz</strong>: I was not certain that I could crack it … there were no first cousins or second cousins … It was really more fourth to six. </p><p>As Liz worked to trace the suspect through his family tree, Wallace turned to another DNA tool and asked Parabon to produce a phenotyping sketch of Robin's killer.</p><p><strong>Ellen Greytak</strong>: DNA phenotyping … it means actually predicting what that person looked like from their DNA. </p><p>But would anyone recognize him?</p>
<h2>Volunteer genetic genealogist identifies a possible suspect</h2><p>In 2021, nearly 30 years after Robin Lawrence's murder, Parabon NanoLabs was tasked with producing a composite of the man investigators believed was her killer.</p><p><strong>Thom Shaw | Forensic artist</strong>:So I get a report from our bioinformatic scientist, and it lays out all the predictions from the DNA …</p><p>Scientists created a facial model based on the DNA predictions. </p><p><strong>Thom Shaw</strong> (working on a composite): … it starts off with … his skin color, which he's predicted to have very fair or fair skin color.<strong> … </strong>he's most likely gonna have a larger chin than average, wider jaw, or cheeks than average … kind of a narrower nose … than average.</p><p>Thom Shaw, a forensic artist at Parabon, says his job was to refine the model by applying other details like hair and eye color. </p><p><strong>Thom Shaw</strong>: I've kind of outlined where his eyes are because I'm gonna be putting new ones in … kind of that dark blue that are predicted. </p><p><strong>Thom Shaw</strong>: I'll … do eyebrows … kind of, most likely like a lighter brownish hair. … And so I gave him a little bit lighter eyebrows to match what his hair color is gonna be … I'll go and find … a hairstyle, something generic ... </p>
<p>Shaw says DNA doesn't reveal a person's age, so the composites are generated as a young adult — typically around 25 years old. </p>
<p><strong>Thom Shaw </strong>(showing finished composite pictured above): So this is him.</p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: Did this look like their mailman? Was this the neighbor's kid? … Was it somebody from work?</p><p>Detective Melissa Wallace set up a video call with Robin's husband Ollie to see if he recognized the man in the composite. </p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: I was really hoping that when Ollie saw that, that he would go, oh my gosh, that looks exactly like so and so.</p><p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: And did he? </p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: He did not. … He said that doesn't spark my memory at all. It looks like nobody I know. </p>
<p>The investigation stalled again. But behind the scenes, volunteer genealogist Liz kept working with that list of 1,500 cousins distantly related to the suspect.</p><p>Liz had eventually traced some of the suspect's ancestors to Canada, where they had settled. That's where she found two cousins that were not related to each other. </p><p><strong>Liz</strong>: And so I ended up with two trees that were highly reliable … And they were the people that uh, that were truly cousins to the suspect. </p><p>Liz says if she could figure out where those two trees were linked, through a marriage, the suspect would be a descendant of that couple.</p>
<p><strong>Liz</strong> (showing family tree): And what I found was this woman on this tree married this man on this tree. … that was it, that was the aha moment … that was when I realized that … he's a descendant of this couple right here. </p><p>After three-and-a-half years, Liz finally had a lead — and it pointed her to a man named Stephan Smerk.</p><p><strong>Liz</strong>: I felt like this really was him. … I didn't know it for certain, but I believed it was. … I contacted the detectives.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: So, she sends me an email … she says, I think I found someone of interest. </p><p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>:What happens as you start looking into him?</p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: Well, we find out — computer programmer up in New York, married to a defense attorney, two kids in high school, nice house in the suburbs, not so much as a speeding ticket on his background. </p><p><strong>Melissa Wallace</strong>: I'm thinking … there's no way this is our guy.</p><p>But according to Det. Jon Long, things got a bit more interesting when they found his yearbook photo — at age 16<strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>Det. Jon Long</strong>: It looked very similar to the phenotyping sketch. … we're like, well … maybe this does make sense.</p>
<p>Stephan Smerk lived in Niskayuna, a town in upstate New York, so investigators decided to pay him a visit. </p>
<p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: Does he know you're coming? </p><p><strong>Det. Jon Long</strong>: No. No. </p><p>They were hoping he would cooperate and provide his DNA. Wallace and Long say he appeared to be home alone, so they knocked on his door. </p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: All we said is we are detectives from Fairfax County, Virginia, and we're looking into a cold case from the 90s. … Do you mind if we come in and talk to you? He said, sure. He invited us in, and —</p><p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: Hold on a minute … So, you say we're from Virginia … We're investigating this murder. His initial reaction. </p><p><strong>Det. Jon Long</strong>: No reaction. None. </p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Jon Long</strong>: Stone-faced.</p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: There was no surprise. There was no fear. Nothing.</p><p>They found his demeanor unusual.</p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: When … we're asking for … DNA, this conversation typically takes a solid 45 minutes … People generally have a lot of questions. … Like, what do you mean someone in my family has committed a murder? … Who was killed?… There was not a single question from him.</p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: We were in and out of his house in five minutes with his DNA. … Consent form signed, swab collected, packaged up. That was it.</p><p>After the visit, detectives checked into their hotel. But then Wallace got an unexpected call.</p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: … it's Steve Smerk calling me … And he says, "I'm at the police department to turn myself in." And I said, "turn yourself in for what?" And he said, "I'm here to turn myself in for the murder."</p>
<p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: A million things start going through my mind.</p><p>Smerk told the detective he was having trouble getting into the Niskayuna Police Department, which was locked.</p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: So, then I'm thinking it must be a smaller police station … And I said, OK, what I need you to do is we're gonna hang up. … I need you to call 911 and tell them that you're there.</p><p>Smerk's call was recorded:</p><p><em>911 OPERATOR: 911, what's the address of your emergency?</em></p><p><em>STEPHAN SMERK: I'm actually here to turn myself in for a cold case crime. </em></p><p><em>911 OPERATOR: You're here to turn yourself in? </em></p>
<p><em>STEPHAN SMERK: Well, they collected DNA, so —</em></p><p><em>911 OPERATOR: OK, what's your —</em></p><p><em>STEPHAN SMERK: — it's only a matter of time.</em></p><p><em>911 OPERATOR: — last name? </em></p><p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: Wow. So, when do you tell him [Det. Long]? </p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: Oh my God. I was freaking out. so. </p><p><strong>Det. Jon Long</strong>: She freaked me out. </p>
<p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: I run down to his room … and I'm banging on his door … I'm like, we got to go to the police department. … He's turning himself in. </p><p>Wallace also reached out to local police, and Stephan Smerk was taken into custody.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: The adrenaline was pumping so hard because the reality hit … And, um, it sounds like he's gonna talk to us about it. </p><p>Detective Long says they had to refocus fast and figure out how they would handle Stephan Smerk's interrogation.</p><p><strong>Det. Jon Long</strong>: … we need to make sure this is a sound interview. … that could potentially be used in court, down the road.</p><p>When they finally sat down with him —</p><p>STEPHAN SMERK: Where do you wanna start? </p>
<p>— investigators say he didn't need much prompting.</p><p>STEPHAN SMERK:  It was 100 percent intentional. </p><p>STEPHAN SMERK: I am a serial killer who's only killed once.</p><p>A stunning confession brings closure to a decades-old mystery</p><p>When investigators met with Stephan Smerk on Sept. 7, 2023, they were skeptical.</p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: … this doesn't happen every day. … So, we, we had to … really think through, well, why is he doing this? </p><p>Detectives had not yet received the results of the DNA sample Smerk had provided, linking him definitively. </p>
<p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: … we needed to be very careful … to make sure that we weren't getting a false confession. </p><p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: So, then what was your approach gonna be? </p><p><strong>Det. Jon Long</strong>: We started talking about things like hey, let's make sure that … he's gonna bring up details of the case without us telling him first. </p><p>STEPHAN SMERK (interrogation): Can you remind me of her name again? Can you say that?</p><p>DET. MELISSA WALLACE: I can. Do you remember anything about the person? </p><p>STEPHAN SMERK: She was African American.</p><p>DET. MELISSA WALLACE: OK. </p>
<p>STEPHAN SMERK: That's all I remember.</p><p><strong>Det. Jon Long</strong>: He starts volunteering information which is great.</p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: So it was just like he wanted to talk about his weekend or, uh, some other family event that he went to. It was a very calm conversation, nonchalant.</p><p>STEPHAN SMERK (interrogation): I was, uh, not in the right frame of mind. </p><p>Smerk told detectives that in November 1994, he was a 22-year-old soldier stationed at Fort Myer in Arlington, Virginia, and on the night of the murder he had been drinking beer.</p><p>STEPHAN SMERK: (interrogation): I was, uh, drunk and under ephedrine …</p><p>He says he had been taking ephedrine pills, a stimulant.</p>
<p>STEPHAN SMERK: (interrogation): … something inside me said that — it's hard to explain … I knew that I was going kill somebody. I did not know who I was going to kill. </p>
<p>STEPHAN SMERK: (interrogation): … it was like this overbearing thought in my brain that … I just had to kill somebody.</p><p>Smerk said he drove to Robin's neighborhood because he was familiar with the area — he'd visited friends who stayed in a house nearby.</p><p>DET. JON LONG (interrogation): … had you had any contact with her, spoke to her or anything like that? </p><p>STEPHAN SMERK: No, I didn't even, to be honest with you, I don't — didn't even know who lived there …  I never met this person before or seen her or anything …</p><p>Smerk confirmed he entered the house from the back deck and told detectives he was wearing a ski mask and leather gloves. </p><p>STEPHAN SMERK (interrogation): I went in and noticed that she had … a baby in one of the rooms. </p><p>He said he went down the hall to Robin's bedroom.</p>
<p>STEPHAN SMERK (interrogation): I startled her, she got out of bed. … She was on her knees … she was just begging for her life. … I cut her up pretty good. … I did everything they taught me in the military, hand-to-hand combat. </p>
<p>STEPHAN SMERK (interrogation): I'm highly, highly influenced by demons …</p><p>He told investigators one of the reasons he enlisted was because he wanted to kill. </p><p>STEPHAN SMERK (interrogation):I want to tell you right now that I — she's the only person that I've killed. … I'm married, I have kids, but I honestly believe that if it wasn't for my wife and my kids, I probably would be a serial killer.</p>
<p>Detective Wallace knew it was critical to link him to that washcloth found in the bathroom, so she asked him if he'd been injured that night.</p><p>STEPHAN SMERK (interrogation): … she clawed at my face. I had a little bit of a scar here. </p><p>DET. MELISSA WALLACE: Did you ever go into her bathroom at all? </p><p>STEPHAN SMERK: I don't remember that. If I did go into the bathroom, it would've been to look at what she did in my face. </p>
<p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: That's when I knew that — that we were in business with putting him in the bathroom and why his DNA was there … that was the biggest confirmation. </p><p>As the interview wrapped up, Long asked Smerk if he wanted to express any remorse to Robin's family. </p><p>STEPHAN SMERK (interrogation): Um, how do I say this? I know you're recording. I don't feel anything for the family. … I can't say that any other way. … I feel bad that I did it because I knew someday my personal freedom would be affected. </p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: I think what you see is 100 percent what you get from him, arrogance, ah, entitlement. He wanted to do it so he did it, and that's it.</p><p>Detective Wallace believes Smerk confessed because he knew he was caught and wanted to turn himself in on his own terms. </p><p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: It wasn't because he was sorry. … It wasn't because he was tired of running for 30 years. … He wanted to maintain control. </p><p>Former FBI profiler Mary Ellen O'Toole, who reviewed the case for "48 Hours," agrees that Smerk wanted to control the narrative. </p>
<p><strong>Mary Ellen O'Toole</strong>: … he was prepared that he was gonna tell his version of the story. …</p><p>O'Toole says she doesn't buy Smerk's claim that Robin's murder was random. She classifies it as a mission-oriented homicide. </p><p><strong>Mary Ellen O'Toole</strong>: He brought the weapon with him. … he had a mask, he had gloves.</p><p><strong>Mary Ellen O'Toole</strong>: …it also happens to be … on an evening when the victim's husband is in a travel status.</p><p><strong>Mary Ellen O'Toole</strong>: This was purposeful … he went inside somebody's home … took enormous risk. … So that suggests to me more of a targeting than it does randomness.</p><p>In her analysis, O'Toole says she was struck by Smerk identifying as a serial killer.</p><p><strong>Mary Ellen O'Toole</strong>: He did come across as someone that had admiration for them.</p>
<p><strong>Anne-Marie Greene</strong>: So here's kind of like the big question, though. … do serial killers stop killing? </p><p><strong>Mary Ellen O'Toole</strong>: Yes, they do.</p><p>According to O'Toole, serial offenders can sometimes channel their compulsion to kill into other crimes, like stalking or voyeurism.</p><p><strong>Mary Ellen O'Toole</strong>: I think it's also possible that he engaged in other behaviors, much less serious than homicide that um, satisfied him. </p><p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: He has no criminal history of any kind. How unusual is that?</p><p><strong>Mary Ellen O'Toole</strong>: Not very unusual. … But here's the important thing to keep in mind, the absence of a rap sheet does not mean that criminal behavior is absent. … It means that they didn't get arrested for it.</p><p>After his confession, Stephan Smerk was arrested and charged with the murder of Robin Lawrence. Detective Wallace says her first phone call was to Robin's daughter, Nicole. </p>
<p><strong>Det. Melissa Wallace</strong>: You could tell the shock, but she didn't, um, break down or crumble. I could tell that she was like, OK, now my job is to notify the rest of the family.</p><p><strong>Mary Warr Cowans</strong>: How is it that he could live his life with his family when he blew up our family 30 years ago. … Where is the justice in that?</p><p>Robin's family prepared for the next step.</p><p><strong>Mary Warr Cowans</strong>: We really wanted to do a trial. … We wanted the world to know what he did, and … I think we wanted the spectacle of that as satisfaction. </p><p>But would they get that chance?</p><h2>Robin Warr Lawrence's spirit lives on through her art</h2><p>A week after Stephan Smerk's interview with police, forensic testing confirmed Smerk's DNA was a match to the blood on the washcloth found in Robin's bathroom.</p><p><strong>Steve Descano</strong>: It's a one in over 7 million chance that it would not have been his DNA.</p>
<p>On April 4, 2024, Fairfax County Commonwealth attorney Steve Descano's office presented the case at a preliminary hearing to determine if there was enough evidence to move forward.</p><p><strong>Steve Descano</strong>: Look, I've dealt with murderers before .. I can tell you that in my mind, Stephan Smerk stands alone as somebody who represents a true danger to the community.</p>
<p>Robin's family saw Smerk for the first time at the hearing.</p><p><strong>Lauren Ovans</strong>: I was amazed how big he was. … he needed two … bailiffs around him. … The first thing I thought of was, like, my aunt didn't stand a chance. </p><p>Prosecutors played Smerk's confession, and the family heard the details of Robin's murder in Smerk's own words.</p><p><strong>Lauren Ovans</strong>: There was no emotion … It - it didn't feel real … just made me feel angry. … like how could he have done that? </p><p>The judge found probable cause that Stephan Smerk killed Robin Lawrence and allowed the case to proceed to a grand jury. On April 15, 2024, a grand jury indicted him. But six months later, he accepted a plea deal for first-degree murder.</p>
<p>STEVE DESCANO (to reporters): We get guaranteed accountability ...</p><p>Descano says the agreement ensured Smerk would be held accountable.</p><p><strong>Steve Descano</strong>: We had the challenge of some witnesses passing, other witnesses, their memories uh, becoming a little bit cloudy and not as sharp. </p><p>Robin's family, however, say they were disappointed.</p><p><strong>Mary Warr Cowans</strong>: We wanted him to be put on trial.</p><p>On March 7, 2025, Smerk returned to court for sentencing. As part of the mitigation strategy for a more lenient sentence, his attorney Dawn Butorac told the judge that in the early 90s, Smerk was a troubled young man, struggling with alcohol and substance abuse.</p><p><strong>Dawn Butorac</strong>: … he eventually decided, I'm gonna join the military, thinking that that would be a good choice for him to maybe get his life stabilized.</p>
<p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: He said he joined the military so he could kill people. What did he mean by that?</p><p><strong>Dawn Butorac</strong>: I never asked him what he meant by that. … I think it was … an idea that if I go, maybe I can take my anger out on this. … Maybe this will get me back on the right track. </p><p>According to Butorac, Smerk was also crippled with an undiagnosed mental illness.</p><p><strong>Dawn Butorac</strong>: It wasn't until several years later that he eventually was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder. … And when you add ephedra and alcohol … he was struggling a lot. </p><p>The FDA banned some ephedra products in 2004, and Butorac says that was in part because when abused with other substances, they could trigger dangerous psychiatric side effects.</p><p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: Did Steve Smerk tell you that he ever had hallucinations … or heard voices —</p><p><strong>Dawn Butorac</strong>: No, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: — anything along those lines – </p><p><strong>Dawn Butorac</strong>: No, no. </p><p><strong>Anne-Marie Green</strong>: — while taking ephedra? </p><p><strong>Dawn Butorac</strong>: No. … But you have to remember at the time also he had undiagnosed bipolar. So it's hard to figure out exactly what his mental state was attributable to.</p><p>She says by the time investigators came to Smerk's door nearly 30 years later, Smerk had sought help for his mental health problems and become sober.

<div class="article-title">Tens of thousands of New Yorkers head to polls for Day 1 of early voting</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Voters in New York City hit the polls Saturday as <span class="link">early voting got underway</span>.</p><p>According to unofficial, preliminary numbers from the Board of Elections, nearly 80,000 voters checked in across all five boroughs.</p><p>More than 24,000 people cast their votes in Manhattan, followed by Brooklyn with just over 22,000, Queens with just over 19,000, the Bronx with nearly 8,000 and Staten Island with just under 6,500.</p><p>"'Cause I don't want the machines to be down on Election Day, so I get out here early," Bronx voter Terri H. said.</p><h2>NYC mayoral election is make or break for some voters</h2><p>Voters who spoke to CBS News New York said issues of concern are affordability, immigration, schools, homelessness, crime and policing.</p>
<p>For some early voters, this election is make or break. They say if the candidate they voted for doesn't win, they may have no choice but to move out of the city.</p><p>"I have like five friends that already left New York because they couldn't afford it," Bronx resident Lansana Keita said. "Depending on who won, I'm gonna stick it out for another year."</p><p><span class="link">Ballots also contain six questions</span> about topics including affordable housing and moving local elections to presidential years to boost voter turnout.</p><p>For now, voters agree this election holds weight in the future of the city.</p>
<p>"I feel sort of, you know, tense about this one," Manhattan voter Bonnie Shapiro said.</p><p>"It's a tough one. It's a difficult one," Manhattan voter Luis Santeiro said.</p><p>"More people voting, more people participating, that's what it's all about. We get better results, I think," Harlem voter Ian Green said.</p><h2>Candidates on the campaign trail as early voting begins</h2><p><span class="link">All three candidates</span> made public appearances on Saturday.</p><p>"Campaign gets serious today. New Yorkers start to focus," independent candidate Andrew Cuomo said.</p><p>The former governor announced <span class="link">an endorsement</span> from the United Clergy Coalition.</p><p>"You want to build affordable housing? Partner with the faith-based community. You want to do mental health services, community-based mental health services? Do it with a faith-based community. Economic development with the faith-based community," he said.</p>
<p>He also emphasized he believes he's the only candidate qualified for the post.</p><p>"You need a mayor who can do the job. It's between me and Mamdani. You know I can do the job, and this is about saving the City of New York," Cuomo said.</p><p>Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa voted early, remaining defiant that he's staying in the race.</p><p>"Today, I cast my vote for myself and the Republican line, straight down the line," he said. "Today, it should be the last time we hear that <span class="link">Curtis Sliwa should drop out</span>."</p><p>He also took shots at his competition.</p><p>"So let the people decide. They have a choice. The two corrupt ones now that they're like Siamese twins, <span class="link">Cuomo and Adams</span>. Zohran Mamdani, who, <span class="link">as I said, you can put his resume on a cocktail napkin</span>, and Curtis Sliwa, who everybody knows, whether you like me, you don't like me, you know I've served the people of New York for over 46 years," Sliwa said.</p><p>Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani met with business leaders in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>"I'm going to be voting on Election Day. And my message to early voters, of which I've already met a number, is that this is our opportunity, it continues to be. One to make the most expensive city in the United States of America affordable," he said. "And it's been so exciting to meet so many New Yorkers who have already done so, casting their vote for the only campaign that actually has a vision for the future of what this city can be, not just redirecting ourselves to thinking only of the past."</p><p>Early voting ends Nov. 2, and Election Day is Nov. 4.</p>

<div class="article-title">Hurricane Melissa strengthens into a powerful Category 3 storm in the Caribbean</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Melissa strengthened rapidly into a Category 3 hurricane on Saturday and was forecast to bring "life-threatening and catastrophic" flash flooding and landslides to Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic early next week, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center warns.</p><p>Hurricane Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major <span class="link">impacts on the mainland United States</span>, but it could be the strongest system this season.</p><h2>Melissa's forecast and path</h2><p>As of Saturday night, Melissa's core was about 125 miles southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 280 miles west-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, the hurricane center said. Maximum sustained winds were 115 mph, with tropical storm-force winds extending some 160 miles from the storm's center. It was inching west at 3 mph.</p>
<p>Melissa is now considered a major hurricane, which is defined as having winds of at least 111 mph. It was forecast to remain a major hurricane when it makes landfall in Jamaica early next week, the hurricane center said. </p><p>It was forecast to move near or over Jamaica during the weekend, and then near or over eastern Cuba by the middle of next week.  </p><p>Melissa could be the most powerful hurricane to hit Jamaica, CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak said Saturday. </p>
<p>"The island's terrain makes it even worse," Kozak said. "Jamaica's mountains force the air to rise, and that creates more rain."   </p><p>The strongest hurricane to hit Jamaica was Gilbert in 1988, Kozak said, which killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage. </p><p>Jamaica, Haiti and eastern Cuba should brace for "catastrophic rainfall, up to nearly 3 feet of rain," CBS News weather anchor Lonnie Quinn said Friday. "Mountainous terrain — there's going to be mudslides. I am fearful for what we will find by the time we get into next week for this portion of the Caribbean."</p><p>On top of that, he warned, the storm could be packing 140 mile per hour winds.</p>
<p>"Jamaica, I think, is going to take the worst of it," Quinn said.</p><p>The storm is expected to continue its slow drift northwest through the weekend, then turn north towards Jamaica on Monday or Tuesday. It will then accelerate towards eastern Cuba, the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos in the middle of the week.</p>
<h2>Hurricane advisories</h2><p>A hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica. A hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning were in effect for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti, from the border with the Dominican Republic to Port-au-Prince.</p><p>A hurricane watch was also in effect for the Cuban provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.</p><p>The Naval Station Guantanamo Bay said it has been moving "non-mission-essential" U.S. citizens off the island in groups ahead of severe weather from Melissa. They will all be evacuated no later than Sunday morning, the station said on social media.</p><p>"Each individual will be allowed one 40-pound bag and a carry-on item," the station's Facebook post said. "Stand by for more directions on when your zone will be called to the Windjammer to get orders."</p>
<h2>Rainfall forecasts</h2><p>Melissa is expected to drop up to 30 inches of rain on parts of southern Haiti, the southern Dominican Republic and Jamaica through Tuesday, with higher amounts possible in some areas, the hurricane center said. Eastern Cuba could see up to 18 inches of rain. </p>
<p>"Catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are probable across portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica," forecasters said. Hispaniola is an island that includes Haiti and the Dominican Republic. </p><p>Additional heavy rainfall is likely beyond Tuesday, the hurricane center said, but uncertainty remains about the more extended forecast.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump travels to Asia to meet China's Xi, as government shutdown continues</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump headed for Asia for the first time this term, a trip on which he's expected to work on investment deals and peace efforts before meeting face-to-face with Chinese President<span class="link"> Xi Jinping</span> to try to de-escalate a <span class="link">trade war</span>.</p><p>"We have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us," Mr. Trump told reporters Friday night as he left the White House. "I think we'll have a good meeting."</p><p>A Treasury spokesperson said that US-China trade talks reconvened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, at around 9:15 a.m. local time on Sunday morning.</p><p>The president had a long-haul flight where he arrived in Malaysia on Sunday morning, the first stop of a three-country visit.</p><p>Aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Mr. Trump told reporters he may be discussing its <span class="link">purchases of Russian oil</span> with Xi. He said China is substantially cutting back on its future purchases after the U.S. imposed sanctions on Moscow's two biggest oil companies. Chinese national oil companies will, at least in the short term, refrain from buying Russian oil, Reuters reported last week.</p>
<p>When asked when he hopes to accomplish from the meeting with China, the president said, "I think a complete deal."</p><p>"I want our farmers to be taken care of, and he wants things also. We're going to be talking about fentanyl," Mr. Trump said Saturday. "I think we have a really good chance of making a very comprehensive deal."</p><p>During a refueling stop in Qatar, Mr. Trump met with the country's emir and prime minister Saturday aboard Air Force One. The Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, said that as soon as he heard the president was coming to Qatar, he wanted to have a conversation.</p><p>Mr. Trump thanked the emir and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani for bringing "peace to the Middle East," after they served as intermediaries during the <span class="link">Israel-Hamas peace deal</span>, calling them a "great ally."</p>
<p>His trip comes as the <span class="link">U.S. government shutdown</span> drags on. Many federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, there are flight disruptions as already-squeezed air traffic controllers work without pay, and states are confronting the possibility that federal food aid could dry up. As Republicans reject Democratic demands to extend health care tax credits, there's no sign of a break in the impasse. But Mr.Trump himself appears to be maintaining a business-as-usual approach, including by embarking on this latest foreign trip.</p><p>"America is shut down and the President is skipping town," Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said.</p><p>Mr. Trump's first stop is at a regional summit in Kuala Lumpur. Trump attended the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit only once during his first term, but this year it comes as Malaysia and the U.S. have been working to address a skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia.</p><p>On Sunday, he's scheduled to have a meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, followed by a joint signing ceremony with the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia.</p><p>"I am on my way to Malaysia, where I will sign the great Peace Deal, which I proudly brokered between Cambodia and Thailand," Mr. Trump said Saturday in a Truth Social post. He also sent condolences to the people of Thailand following the death of Queen Mother Sirikit. </p><p>"I will be seeing their wonderful Prime Minister when we land. In order to accommodate everyone for this major event, we will be signing the Peace Deal immediately upon arrival," he said.</p><p>Mr. Trump threatened earlier this year to withhold trade deals with the countries if they didn't stop fighting, and his administration has since been working with Malaysia to nail down an expanded ceasefire.</p>
<p>From there, Mr. Trump heads to Japan and South Korea, where he's expected to make progress on talks for at least $900 billion in investments for U.S. factories and other projects that those countries committed to in return for easing Trump's planned <span class="link">tariff rates</span> down to 15% from 25%.</p><p>The trip to Tokyo comes a week after Japan elected its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. Trump is set to meet with Takaichi, who is a protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Mr. Trump was close to Abe, who was assassinated after leaving office.</p><p>Mr. Trump said Takaichi's relationship with Abe was "a good sign" and "I look forward to meeting her."</p><p>While there, Mr. Trump is expected to be hosted by Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and meet with <span class="link">U.S. troops who are stationed</span> in Japan, according to a senior U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity about the planned trip.</p><p>In South Korea, Mr. Trump is expected to hold a <span class="link">highly anticipated meeting</span> with China's Xi on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.</p><p>While the APEC summit is set to be held in Gyeongju, the Trump-Xi meeting is expected to take place in the city of Busan, according to the U.S. official.</p><p>The meeting follows months of volatile moves in a <span class="link">trade war</span> between China and the U.S. that have rattled the global economy.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump hikes tariffs on Canada by another 10% in response to anti-tariff ad</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump announced Saturday that he is raising U.S. tariffs on Canada by an additional 10% in response to the continued airing of <span class="link">an anti-tariff advertisement</span> created by the local government of the Canadian province of Ontario.</p><p>In a post to Truth Social Saturday afternoon, Mr. Trump described the airing of the ad during Friday night's Game 1 of the World Series as a "hostile act."</p><p>"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now," Mr. Trump wrote.</p><p>The move comes even though Ontario's leader said the ad would be halted beginning Monday.</p><p>CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment on when such an increase would take effect and what imports it would apply to, and to Global Affairs Canada.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Ontario officials began airing an ad featuring excerpts from a 1987 radio address by the late President Ronald Reagan in which he said tariffs work "only for a short time" and "hurt every American worker and consumer."   </p><p>The ad drew the ire of Mr. Trump Thursday, who reacted by terminating trade negotiations with Canada. The president also pointed to a statement from the Ronald Reagan Foundation alleging that the ad had misrepresented Reagan's original radio address.  </p><p>Following Mr. Trump's comments, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the ad campaign will be put on hold starting Monday "so that trade talks can resume."</p><p>"Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses," Ford wrote on social media Friday. "We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels."</p>
<p>In his post Saturday, however, Mr. Trump claimed that Ontario officials had indicated the ad "was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY."</p><p>The president claimed Ontario's government allowed the ad to run Friday during the World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers "knowing that it was a FRAUD."</p><p>Trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada have been ongoing for months amid the White House's global trade war. Over the summer, Mr. Trump <span class="link">hiked tariffs on the country</span> to 35%, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.</p><p>Back in March, Canada imposed 25% retaliatory tariffs on many U.S. products not covered by the USMCA. But in August, as part of efforts to reach a deal on tariffs, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney <span class="link">said those retaliatory tariffs were being lifted</span>. The two nations have yet to reach such a deal.  </p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A 24-year old Honduran national was struck and killed on a highway as he tried to escape ICE agents who stopped his vehicle, officials said.</p><p>Jose Castro-Rivera was in a vehicle that was stopped on I-264 eastbound in Virginia around 11 a.m. local time on Thursday, according to Virginia State Police, who were responding to a report of a vehicle-pedestrian crash at the Military Highway interchange.</p><p>When they arrived, troopers found an adult male who had been hit by a 2002 Ford pickup truck. The man was identified as Rivera, and was pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>A preliminary investigation by VSP found that he was "fleeing from a pursuit initiated by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement when he exited his vehicle and attempted to cross the interstate."</p><p>Officials from VSP were not involved in the pursuit but are investigating the pedestrian crash, which remains under investigation.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said ICE stopped the vehicle in which the Honduran national was traveling as "part of a targeted, intelligence-based immigration enforcement operation."</p><p>"Upon determining that the occupants were in the United States illegally, officers began detaining the occupants of the targeted vehicle. However, one of the vehicle's occupants, Jose Castro-Rivera, resisted heavily and fled the scene onto a busy highway,  creating a significant safety risk to himself and the general public," the agency said. "Unfortunately, a passing vehicle struck Castro-Rivera."</p><p>One of the ICE officers gave Castro-Rivera CPR before he died, the DHS spokesperson said.</p><p>"The officer then informed the three detained aliens that their friend had deceased," the DHS spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Federal crackdowns have been <span class="link">occurring nationwide</span> in recent weeks.</p><p> <span class="link">Earlier this week</span>, nine immigrants from Africa suspected of being in the country illegally were taken into custody by Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents during what DHS called a "targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation on Canal Street in New York City focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods."</p><p>ICE deported about 140 individuals back to Venezuela in its <span class="link">latest removal flight </span>on Oct. 15. </p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Kamala Harris mused about her political future and another presidential run, saying Saturday, "I am not done," in a wide-ranging interview with CBS News' partner, the BBC.</p><p>Harris initially stayed out of the spotlight after losing the 2024 race to Donald Trump, but she has been back on the airwaves in the past month to promote her new book, "107 Days," about her turbulent time as the Democratic nominee.</p><p>Asked in her BBC interview whether former President Joe Biden's last-minute withdrawal from the race stymied her chance to become president, Harris said it was a question to which she will never know the answer. </p><p>She said warnings she made about President Trump on the campaign trail had been proved right, calling him a "tyrant." She said she believed her predictions about Mr. Trump running an authoritarian government had been realized. Harris also called out businesses and universities for, in her view, toeing the line and bowing too easily to the president's demands. </p><p>The White House responded to Harris' assertions in a statement to the BBC through spokeswoman Abigail Jackson.</p>
<p>"When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should've taken the hint - the American people don't care about her absurd lies."</p><p>During the interview, Harris also focused on the future and touched on the possibility of a woman being in the White House one day.</p><p>Harris told the BBC her grandnieces would, "in their lifetime, for sure," see a female president.

<p>When asked whether she would consider another presidential run, Harris didn't commit, but didn't rule it out,  saying "possibly," and adding, "I'm not focusing on that right now."</p><p>However, when CBS News <span class="link">polled</span> residents in her home state of California this week on whether Harris or Gov.

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>PENDLETON, Ore. — It's hard times in America's heartland right now, where many farmers are on the brink of bankruptcy due, in part, to President Trump's trade war shutting off global sales of many of their crops. </p> <p>Trump's tariffs have also made imported fertilizer and other equipment farmers rely on even more expensive amid already high inflation. But in one corner of Pacific Northwest wheat country, there are glimmers of economic hope due to the burgeoning business of "craft flour."</p> <p>On the Umatilla Indian Reservation near Pendleton, Ore., Washington-state based Cairnspring Mills is building a new craft flour mill that will expand the company's production twelvefold and give some wheat farmers a local market for their grains. Upwards of 90% of all the wheat grown in the Pacific Northwest is exported.</p>
<p>"We're trying to do our little part in changing that because the commodity market is unpredictable," says Kevin Morse, co-founder of Cairnspring. "It's usually a race to the bottom and not profitable." </p> <p>Once at full production, the new mill will need about 2 million bushels of wheat a year, which is still a blip in the overall Northwest wheat market. Even though it's growing, analysts say craft flour coveted by artisan breadmakers is still a niche business.</p>
<p>The mill is expected to open within a year with help from the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation on farmland near the casino. An estimated 20 jobs will be created, and the mill is promising to give Native people priority in training and hiring. </p> <p>Tribal officials say it's a signal that Indian Country is open for business.</p> <p>"For small communities in rural areas, there's hope," says Steven Hart, a trustee at large.  </p>

<div class="article-title">Melissa expected to rapidly intensify into major hurricane in the Caribbean</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Hurricane Melissa is expected to rapidly intensify into a major hurricane on Sunday. According to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, the hurricane is likely to bring life-threatening and catastrophic flash flooding and landslides to parts of Jamaica and southern Hispaniola, which is made up of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</p> <p>The category two hurricane was moving at three miles per hour Saturday evening with increased top sustained winds of 100 miles per hour. The storm's slow movement is expected to bring a deluge of rain to parts of the Caribbean and prolong its dangerous impacts over a period of several days.</p>
<p>A hurricane watch is issued for Haiti from its border with the Dominican Republic to Port-au-Prince. Melissa was about 250 miles southwest of the Haitian capital late Saturday. The storm was also nearing Kingston, Jamaica. A hurricane warning is in effect for the island.</p> <p>During a press briefing on Saturday, Jamaican officials said time was running out for residents to prepare for the storm. Evan Thompson, Director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, warned Melissa could be worse than previous major storms that battered the island, such as Hurricane Wilma in 2005.</p> <p>"It's going to sit there pouring water while it's barely moving. And that is a significant challenge that we have to be aware of," said Thompson. "It's going to cause significant, widespread, catastrophic, life-threatening floods, as long as what is predicted does take place."</p> <p>The National Hurricane Center forecasts Hurricane Melissa will make landfall in Jamaica early next week. The center is forecasting 15-30 inches of rain in Jamaica and parts of southern Hispaniola into midweek. Some local areas in the region could see as many as 40 inches of rain.</p> <p>Jamaica Information Service (JIS) said the island's National Water Commission fully activated its emergency protocols. Hospitals, children's homes, and correctional facilities will be prioritized for water transported by truck if Jamaica's water supply is disrupted. JIS also warned residents to be aware that floods may displace crocodiles from water ways.</p>
<p>At least one person has been killed in the Dominican Republic as a result of the intense rainfall.

<div class="article-title">The White House movie theater demolition ends a storied era in presidential history</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>It was, on occasion, used by presidents to rehearse important speeches such as the State of the Union address; and at other times, as a spot for visitors to dump their hats, bags and coats. But for more than 80 years, the White House movie theater was mostly a place where the first family and their guests went for entertainment.</p> <p>Demolition began this week of the White House Family Theater — along with the rest of the White House's East Wing where the snug, shoe-box-shaped auditorium was located — to make way for a new $300 million ballroom. It marks the end of an era in American movie theater history.</p>
<p>Since its conversion from a cloakroom by Franklin Roosevelt in 1942, the private, 40-ish-seat theater has screened everything from newsreels and documentaries to westerns and musicals. It has been through several facelifts, most recently ditching cream and red floral curtains, and beige walls and seating for all-round "movie-palace red" ornamented with gold molding and dark wood trim following a renovation overseen by first lady Laura Bush in 2004.</p>
<p>"The best perk of the White House is not Air Force One or Camp David or anything else, it's the wonderful movie theater I get here," then-President Bill Clinton told film critic Roger Ebert in a 1999 interview.</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter was also a big fan. In a single term, the 39th president screened at least 400 films between this venue and Camp David, starting with <em>All the President's Men</em> — a movie about the Watergate scandal — soon after he was sworn in. Richard Nixon saw <em>Patton</em>, about the controversial World War II Gen. George S. Patton, multiple times during the Vietnam War. Barack Obama's many screenings at the theater ranged from<em> Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom</em> and <em>Selma</em> to <em>Julie &amp; Julia</em> and <em>Star Wars Rogue One.</em> President Trump's picks have included <em>Finding Dory</em> and <em>Sunset Boulevard</em>. John F. Kennedy, who loved James Bond movies, saw <em>From Russia With Love</em> the day before he was assassinated in 1963.</p>
<p>Not all U.S. presidents were film buffs. According to a 1997 <em>New York Times </em>interview with Paul Fischer, who served as the White House's projectionist from the 1950s to the '80s, Lyndon B. Johnson slept through most screenings. (Fischer kept careful logs of all of the movies shown at the theater. A sample from Kennedy's White House years can be seen here.)</p>
<p>"It was a place for the president to watch what America was watching," said Matt Lambros, who authored several books about historic movie theaters, in an interview with NPR. "To have it destroyed is bulldozing a piece of American history."</p> <p>The White House did not respond to NPR's request for comment, nor confirm reports from other media outlets about plans to build a new movie theater as part of the East Wing's redevelopment.</p> <p>"We're just going off of their word that a theater will be rebuilt," said Lambros. "I hope that's the case, and the next hundred years of presidents can enjoy it."</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump threatens Canada with 10% extra import tax over anti-tariffs ad</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10% because of an anti-tariff television ad aired by the province of Ontario.</p> <p>The ad used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs, angering Trump who said he would end trade talks with Canada. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he would pull the ad after the weekend, and it ran Friday night during the first game of the World Series.</p> <p>"Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform as he flew aboard Air Force One to Malaysia.</p>
<p>"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now."</p> <p>It was not immediately clear when the 10% hike would come into effect, nor whether it would apply to all Canadian goods.</p> <p>Canada's economy has been hit hard by Trump's tariffs, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has been trying to work with Trump to lower them. More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion U.S.) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.</p> <p>Many Canadian products have been hit with a 35% tariff, while steel and aluminum face rates of 50%. Energy products have a lower rate of 10%, while other goods covered by the U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement are exempt. That trade agreement is slated for review. Trump negotiated the deal in his first term, but has since soured on it.</p> <p>Trump and Carney will both attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. But Trump told reporters traveling with him that he had no intention of meeting Carney there.</p> <p>Trump said the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president and a beloved figure in the Republican Party. But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario's ad spelling out the case against tariffs.</p>
<p>Trump has complained the ad was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled for next month that could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy.</p>

<div class="article-title">June Lockhart, beloved mother figure from 'Lassie' and 'Lost In Space,' dies at 100</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>LOS ANGELES — June Lockhart, who became a mother figure for a generation of television viewers whether at home in "Lassie" or up in the stratosphere in "Lost In Space," has died. She was 100.</p> <p>Lockhart died Thursday of natural causes at her home in Santa Monica, family spokesman Lyle Gregory, a friend of 40 years, said Saturday.</p> <p>"She was very happy up until the very end, reading the New York Times and LA Times everyday," he said. "It was very important to her to stay focused on the news of the day."</p> <p>The daughter of prolific character actor Gene Lockhart, Lockhart was cast frequently in ingenue roles as a young film actor. Television made her a star.</p>
<p>From 1958 to 1964, she portrayed Ruth Martin, who raised the orphaned Timmy (Jon Provost), in the popular CBS series "Lassie." From 1965 to 1968, she traveled aboard the spaceship Jupiter II as mother to the Robinson family in the campy CBS adventure "Lost in Space."</p> <p>Her portrayals of warm, compassionate mothers endeared her to young viewers, and decades later baby boomers flocked to nostalgia conventions to meet Lockhart and buy her autographed photos.</p> <p>Offscreen, Lockhart insisted, she was nothing like the women she portrayed.</p> <p>"I must quote Dan Rather," she said in a 1994 interview. "I can control my reputation, but not my image, because my image is how you see me.</p> <p>"I love rock 'n' roll and going to the concerts. I have driven Army tanks and flown in hot air balloons. And I go plane-gliding — the ones with no motors. I do a lot of things that don't go with my image."</p> <p>Early in her career, Lockhart appeared in numerous films. Among them: "All This and Heaven Too," "Adam Had Four Sons," "Sergeant York," "Miss Annie Rooney," "Forever and a Day" and "Meet Me in St. Louis."</p> <p>She also made "Son of Lassie," the 1945 sequel to "Lassie, Come Home," playing the grown-up version of the role created by Elizabeth Taylor.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">New life on television</h3> <p>When her movie career as an adult faltered, Lockhart shifted to television, appearing in live drama from New York and game and talk shows. She was the third actress to play the female lead in "Lassie" on TV, following Jan Clayton and Cloris Leachman. (Provost had replaced the show's original child star, Tommy Rettig, in 1957.)</p> <p>Lockhart spoke frankly about her canine co-star. In the first place, she said in 1989, Lassie was a laddie, because male collies "are bigger, the ruff is bigger, they're more imposing looking."</p> <p>She added: "I worked with four Lassies. There was only one main Lassie at a time. Then there was a dog that did the running, a dog that did the fighting, and a dog that was a stand-in, because only humans can work 14 hours a day without needing a nap.</p> <p>"Lassie was not especially friendly with anybody. Lassie was wholly concentrated on the trainers."</p> <p>After six years in the rural setting of "Lassie," Lockhart moved to outer space, embarking on the role of Maureen Robinson, the wise, reassuring mother of a family that departs on a five-year flight to a faraway planet in "Lost in Space."</p> <p>After their mission is sabotaged by a fellow passenger, the nefarious Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris), the party bounces from planet to planet, encountering weird creatures and near-disasters that required viewers to tune in the following week to learn of the escape. Throughout the three-year run, Mrs. Robinson offered consolation and a slice of her "space pie."</p> <p>As with "Lassie," Lockhart enjoyed working on "Lost in Space": "It was like going to work at Disneyland every day."</p> <p>In 1968, Lockhart joined the cast of "Petticoat Junction" for the rural comedy's last two seasons, playing Dr. Janet Craig. The original star, Bea Benaderet, had been diagnosed with cancer and died, also in 1968.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">A little bit of everything</h3> <p>Lockhart remained active long after "Lost in Space," appearing often in episodic television as well as in recurring roles in the daytime soap opera "General Hospital" and nighttime soaps, "Knots Landing" and "The Colbys." Her film credits included "The Remake" and the animated "Bongee Bear and the Kingdom of Rhythm," for which she provided the voice for Mindy the Owl.</p> <p>She also used her own media pass to attend presidential news conferences, narrated beauty pageants and holiday parades, appeared in B pictures and toured in the plays "Steel Magnolias," "Bedroom Farce" and "Once More with Feeling."</p> <p>"Her true passion was journalism," Gregory said. "She loved going to the White House briefing rooms."</p> <p>Lockhart liked to tell the story of how her parents met, saying they were hired separately for a touring production sponsored by inventor Thomas A. Edison and decided on marriage during a stop at Lake Louise, Alberta.</p> <p>Their daughter was born June 25, 1925, in New York City. The family moved to Hollywood 10 years later, and Gene Lockhart worked steadily as a character actor, usually in avuncular roles, sometimes as a villain. His wife, Kathleen, often appeared with him.</p> <p>Young June made her stage debut at 8, dancing in a children's ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House. Her first film appearance was a small role in the 1938 "A Christmas Carol," playing the daughter of Bob Cratchit and his wife, who were played by her parents.</p> <p>She was married and divorced twice: to John Maloney, a physician, father of her daughters Anne Kathleen and June Elizabeth; and architect John C. Lindsay.</p> <p>Throughout her later career, Lockhart was connected in the public mind with "Lassie."</p> <p>Even though she sometimes mocked the show, she conceded: "How wonderful that in a career there is one role for which you are known. Many actors work all their lives and never have one part that is really theirs."</p>

<div class="article-title">First, came the Louvre heist. Then came the memes</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>PARIS —<strong> </strong>It was the heist heard around the world. So naturally, it was only a matter of hours before it transitioned into memes seen around the internet.</p>
<p>Four masked thieves. Nine "priceless" pieces. All stolen in less than seven minutes, from the world's most famous museum. The Oct. 19 daylight robbery at the Louvre has already been compared to a Dan Brown novel or the latest installment in Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's<em> </em>film franchise.</p> <p>Now it's something else entirely — internet culture's newest obsession. From brands to influencers to actors with projects to promote (here's looking at you, George Clooney), the Louvre heist has become the latest template for going viral.</p>
<p>Authorities, meanwhile, are still looking for answers. French police say the investigation continues, with about 100 people working on the case. Investigators say they've collected more than 150 trace samples — including DNA and fingerprints left on gear abandoned at the scene — which are now being analyzed by forensic experts in Paris.</p> <p>One twist came earlier this week when Empress Eugénie's diamond-and-gold encrusted crown — one of the stolen items — was found damaged near the scene, apparently dropped or abandoned during the thieves' escape.</p>
<p>Eight other jewels — all relics of France's imperial history — remain missing. The estimated value of the items is $102 million (88 million euros), though France's interior ministry described the jewels as "priceless." France's culture minister called the theft a "humiliation." The museum's director admitted that the heist "was not inevitable," acknowledging the failure of its security.</p> <p>The Louvre's protection systems are expected to face more scrutiny in the coming weeks, particularly as questions grow about the lack of security cameras in the museum's Apollo Gallery, where the robbery took place.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Turning crime into content</strong></h3> <p>The thieves entered the second-floor gallery via a window using an electric lift — which they also used to scurry back down to ground level before jumping on scooters toward the nearest highway.</p>
<p>On Friday, Böcker, the German machinery company that made the lift entered the conversation, releasing a cheeky post featuring an ad across its social media pages. The ad features a photo of its ladder propped against the Louvre's façade with the caption, "If you're in a hurry, Böcker Agilo carries up to 400 kg of treasures at 42 m per minute — as quiet as a whisper."</p>
<p>It was part ad, part wink. Suddenly, the family-run company's longtime slogan "my way to the top" has gained new meaning.</p> <p>They weren't alone. IKEA Switzerland posted its own tongue-in-cheek ad promoting a glass-dome display case. The caption read: "Won't protect your crown jewels either. But it will give them the right spotlight."</p> <p>Others on TikTok and Instagram have turned the Louvre heist into a Halloween costume: think black jumpsuits, leather gloves, sleek sunglasses, and glittering imitation jewels.</p> <p>"Heists are so back!" the fashion influencer @clothesfordinner declared</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>"How nice to read about a heist rather than a massacre"</strong></h3> <p>Part of the fascination comes from the fantasy the story invites.</p> <p>"How thrilling, upon hearing the news, to put oneself in the shoes of the thieves, and imagine making off with the diamonds scot-free," <em>The Atlantic </em>staff writer Caity Weaver wrote in a recent piece chronicling the public's obsession with the heist.</p> <p>Or to put the obsession even more simply: "How<strong> </strong>nice to read about a heist rather than a massacre."</p> <p>The stolen trinkets, Weaver writes, "have garnered far more attention now than they would have had they remained on view at the Louvre for 5,000 years."</p>
<p>Perhaps she's onto something. And perhaps that's why Hollywood, for its part, couldn't resist the moment, either.</p> <p>George Clooney — who plays master thief Danny Ocean in the <em>Ocean's</em> franchise — joked at a film premiere last week, "They seem to have done a pretty good job of getting away with it … I was very proud of those guys."</p> <p>Asked whether the heist might inspire the upcoming <em>Ocean's 14</em> film, Clooney quipped, "I think we should rob the Louvre."</p> <p>And then there's the dapper man the internet has decided is on the case.</p> <p>After the robbery, an Associated Press photographer captured a young looking well-dressed passerby near the Louvre's gates — coat, tie, and fedora — as police sealed off the museum.</p>
<p>Online, he was instantly dubbed "a more dashing version of the famed Inspector Clouseau" from the Pink Panther franchise, supposedly a suave detective investigating the theft.</p>
<p>The AP photographer, Thibault Camus, later said the man was simply walking past. "He appeared in front of me, I saw him, I took the photo," Camus says. "He passed by and left."</p> <p>Still, the image took off, racking up millions of views and a flood of memes.</p>
<p>Even the Paris prosecutor's office seemed to play along. In an email to AP asking if the mystery man was a part of the official investigation, officials replied with a wink: "We'd rather keep the mystery alive ;)."</p>

<div class="article-title">Picasso portrait of muse Dora Maar, long hidden from view, sells for $37 million</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>PARIS — A vividly hued Picasso portrait of longtime muse and partner Dora Maar that had remained hidden from public view for more than eight decades sold Friday at auction for 32 million euros (about $37 million), including fees — surpassing expectations but far from the artist's most expensive work ever auctioned.</p>
<p>Painted in July 1943, "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat (Dora Maar)" depicts Maar in a brightly colored floral hat. Maar, an artist and photographer herself, had been Picasso's partner and muse for about seven years, and the relationship was coming to a painful close. The work was purchased in 1944 and had not been on the market since, remaining in the family collection.</p> <p>The painting, part of Picasso's "Woman in a Hat" series, was auctioned at the Drouot auction house in Paris. Auctioneer Christophe Lucien called the final sale, to a buyer in the room, "an enormous success," as well as a very emotional moment. He said the price — 32,012,397 euros after adding buyer fees to the 27-million hammer price — was not only well above estimates but also the highest paid at auction this year for any artwork in France.</p>
<p>Lucien called the painting "a little piece of the story of love" — albeit a bittersweet one — between Picasso and Maar. She was 29 when she met the artist and quickly became his muse and the model for "Guernica," among other works. He later left her for the younger Francoise Gilot and she died at 89, having lived an increasingly reclusive life.</p>
<p>Theirs "was not a very simple story," Lucien said, adding that the painting came at the end of it. "You see that she was containing tears because she understood that Picasso was leaving her."</p> <p>At a preview this week, Picasso specialist Agnès Sevestre-Barbé marveled at how vivid the portrait has remained.</p> <p>"We have a painting that is exactly as it was when it left the studio," she said. "It wasn't varnished, which means we have all its raw material, all of it. It's a painting where you can feel all the colors, the entire chromatic range."</p> <p>"It's a painting that speaks for itself," she added. "You just have to look at it — it's full of expression, and you can see all of Picasso's genius."</p> <p>Previously, Sevestre-Barbé noted, the work had only been seen in a black-and-white photograph. "We couldn't imagine from this photo that this painting was so colorful, so amazing, really."</p>
<p>Auctioneer Lucien said before the sale that the work was of huge interest across the globe.</p> <p>"It's being talked about in all the world capitals with a strong art market, from the United States to Asia, and of course through all the major European markets," he said.</p> <p>Though selling above expectations, the work was far from the most expensive Picasso work sold at auction. In 2023, the artist's famed "Femme à la montre" ("Woman with a Watch") — portraying another muse, Marie-Thérèse Walter — sold for $139.4 million, the second most valuable Picasso sold at auction. The most valuable was $179.4 million, paid in 2015 for a version of "Les Femmes d'Alger" ("Women of Algiers").</p>

<div class="article-title">Drone photo winners will amaze your eyeballs: From a high-up horseman to a holy river</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A solitary horseman, illuminated by a beam of light, stands on the snow, surrounded by eerie and jagged mountain peaks. It's an otherworldly image and it raises the question: How did a photographer manage to make such a captivating picture?</p> <p>The answer: Drones!</p> <p>That particular photo, titled "The Lone Horseman," by Dennis Schmelz, a filmmaker based in Germany took top honors in this year's Siena awards, a global competition that celebrates the art of aerial photography captured by drones.</p> <p>The image was made in Cappadocia, Turkey — a mecca for photographers because of its rockscape with "fairy chimneys." Schmelz wanted to capture a different perspective — instead of the tourists and hot-air balloons of summer, he wanted a winter scene when snow covers the rocks.</p>
<p> "Silence fills the air and the whole region feels timeless and untouched," he says.</p> <p>He sent up his drone to photograph a horseman at sunset. "I noticed a narrow plateau between two large rocks that formed a perfect natural stage. I asked the rider to move right into the center of the frame," he says.</p> <p>The final image is a vertical panorama made of two drone photos. Because of the angle, it looks as if the rider is standing on a floating island — but there's a hidden path on the left side that leads up there.</p> <p>"That's what fascinates me about drone photography — it allows us to discover new perspectives and reveal patterns that are invisible from the ground," says Schmelz.</p> <p>That's not to say drones work miracles. "The shooting angle must be carefully calibrated," says Susanna Scafuri, a journalist and photo editor based in Italy and a member of the jury.</p> <p>But the result can be spectacular, she says.</p> <p>And it's not just about the technology, stresses Cornelia Marchis, a German photographer and photo editor based in Milan and another judge this year. She's drawn to photos that offer "new ways of seeing familiar places" and "convey strong information or tell a compelling story."</p>
<p>Here's a selection of award-winning and highly commended drone photographs from the Global South countries that Goats &amp; Soda covers with one geographic exception — an image from Italy that's so delightful that we couldn't resist including it.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Dhaka City, an urban panorama</h3>
<p>A photographer and creative director based in Barcelona, Fran Arnau made the photograph "Dhaka, Urban Panorama" in the capital of Bangladesh in early morning light. The Buriganga River divides the frame in two — on one side, a dense web of buildings and urban life; on the other, the shipyards where boats are repaired, rest or prepare to sail again.</p> <p>"From the air, this composition reveals a delicate balance between chaos and order," says Arnau. "The vessels line up like geometric shapes on dark water, while the buildings form an earthy, colorful mosaic."</p> <p>Arnau merged 12 drone shots into a single panorama. This stitching technique "allowed me to embrace the full breadth of Dhaka's landscape both its dense vertical growth and its dynamic connection to the river."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Traditional Boli Khela</h3>
<p>The image was taken by businessman Mohammad Shahriar Foisal on April 25, 2024, during Abdul Jabbar's Boli Khela — a century-old wrestling tournament held annually in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Founded in 1909 by respected local businessman Jabbar, the event was born at a time of growing resistance to British colonial rule as a way to promote unity, physical strength and cultural identity.</p> <p>Today, Boli Khela draws thousands from across the country and abroad. The matches are intense, with powerful throws and strategic grapples, and the crowd's energy adds to the electric atmosphere.</p> <p>"I stood near the ring searching for the best spot to launch my drone," says Foisal. "This event has always been close to my heart. I wanted to capture not only the action in the ring but also the spirit of the crowd and the tradition behind it," he says. "This photo is my tribute to the cultural richness and enduring energy of Boli Khela."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">The seaweed road of Fujian</h3>
<p>Last May, Sarah Wouters, a Dutch travel photographer living in Bangkok, went to the coastal town Xiafu in the Fujian region of China, which is famous for seaweed farming.</p> <p>"Seaweed is cultivated on long bamboo poles and the farmers use interconnected bamboo stakes that form a flowing S-shape, which we can only see from a high vantage point," says Wouters. She flew a drone above the village and started taking pictures, hoping to capture that beautiful symmetry. 15 minutes later, it started to rain. "I was really lucky to get this winning photo," she says.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Swallowed — a ship stranded in a dried-out lake.</h3>
<p>Iranian photographer Mohammad Ataei Mohammadi drove 870 miles from his home in Gonbad Kavus, in the Golestan Province of Iran, to document the severe drought at Lake Urmia. Mohammadi uses drones to capture both beautiful and alarming environmental scenes.</p> <p>Lake Urmia's drought is not solely a natural phenomenon, he says. "It is the result of a combination of human and climatic factors: mismanagement of water resources, excessive water extraction for agriculture and industry, numerous dams blocking the lake's natural inflow and climate change — including rising temperatures, high evaporation and reduced rainfall."</p> <p>The power of this photo lies in its symbolic layers. "The white salt streaks encircling the ship look like arms pulling it downward, reminding us that if we are not kind to nature, its inner monster awakens and can even consume humanity," he says. "The ship, a symbol of industry, technology, and human presence, now appears small, alone and defeated against the immense, silent power of nature."</p> <p>"Receiving this award is a tremendous honor, but at the heart of this achievement lies deep sadness," says Mohammadi. "Each time the photo is praised, it reminds me of the gradual death of a lake," he says.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Aarti [offering of light to the gods] under the stars</h3>
<p>Miami-based photographer Thibault Gerbaldi wanted a a bird's eye view of the Ganges River, where each evening, thousands gather to witness the prayers, fire and chanting that celebrate the river as a source of life and purification. His goal was to show its full scale from above: "The density of people, the devotion that extends even to the boats far from shore and the extraordinary sense of collective faith." he says. The image won first place in the People category of the drone awards.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Miniature paradise</h3>
<p>Here's the photo from Italy that gives us vicarious joy: people relaxing in the hot springs of Cascate del Mulino.</p> <p>Gilad Topaz, a drone photographer from Israel, made the picture at sunset on a cold evening. "I was very surprised when I got there wearing warm clothes and saw all these people in the water," he says. After a few minutes of observing the beautiful springs, he launched his drone.</p> <p><em>Kamala Thiagarajan is a freelance journalist based in Madurai, Southern India.

<p>My family and I have been watching post-season baseball, and I think I have to lie down.</p> <p>We've seen so many ads for drugs prescribed to treat plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis that I'm sure I've developed a rash, nausea, joint pain and dizziness. Just by watching.</p> <p>iSpot, the TV ad news site, says drug companies bought $895.8 million worth of ads in sports programming last year. The commercials that run during post-season baseball are rife with talk of dermatitis, dehydration, and wheezing. It's almost a relief to see just an ad for beer, or a lizard selling car insurance.</p>
<p>"The baseball playoffs are watched by millions," Dr. Caleb Alexander, of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness, reminds us. "These games offer drug companies a captive audience, a lot with grey hair, who may have diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol and other common diseases."</p> <p>Prescription drug ads were once banned on broadcasts. But companies argued that infringed on free speech; and the drugs could help people. The FDA now permits pharmaceutical ads, as long as what regulators call "dual-modality risk statements" — possible side effects — are clearly stated.</p> <p>And so you see commercials that show winsome old friends dancing, biking, and shooting down forested zip lines, despite the shadow of psoriasis, insomnia, anxiety or eczema.</p> <p>Then the same soothing voice that advises you to see a doctor for a prescription cautions the medication might also lead you to develop symptoms of myelosuppression, psoriatic arthritis and abdominal swelling.</p> <p>"Medicines are not inherently 'good' or 'bad,'" advises Dr. Alexander. But direct-to-consumer advertising for drugs, he believes, "may drive behavior in ways that patients, and doctors — keep in mind we are watching the baseball games, too — may not even be aware of.

<div class="article-title">A report claims left-wing terrorism is rising. The data paints a complicated picture</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>

<p>The assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk has turbocharged the conversation — and fears — around political violence in the U.S. And, more than perhaps any other recent high-profile incident, it has fed claims that far-left extremists are primarily responsible for the worsening environment.</p> <p>"From the attack on my life in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, which killed a husband and father, to the attacks on ICE agents, to the vicious murder of a health care executive in the streets of New York, to the shooting of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and three others, radical-left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives," President Trump said, just hours after Kirk was killed.</p>
<p>So far, no information has been disclosed that clearly links the man charged with Kirk's killing to leftist groups or movements.</p> <p>Still, the Trump administration's claim that domestic terrorism largely comes from the left has flown in the face of data. Federal law enforcement authorities and non-governmental researchers have, for years, found the far right to be the most "lethal and persistent" domestic terrorist threat. Among examples they cite are racially motivated mass killings at an African American church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, a Walmart in El Paso in 2019, and a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y., in 2022; and the 2018 massacre at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh.</p> <p>But a recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) posits that a reversal took place in the first half of 2025. It analyzed roughly 30 years of data and found that between Jan. 1 and July 4 of this year, the number of far-left terrorist plots and attacks outnumbered those from the far right.</p>
<p>"My hope was to bring some data to the discussion and to try to use the data to understand possible reasons left wing terrorism might be increasing and right wing terrorism might be decreasing," said Daniel Byman, director of the Warfare, Irregular Threats and Terrorism Program at CSIS. Byman co-authored the study with Riley McCabe, an associate fellow in the same program.</p> <p>But the report itself has ignited a firestorm of debate within the field of counterterrorism and extremism research. For many, the conclusions are premature. And ultimately, critics say it does more to reveal the complications around collecting and analyzing data on domestic terrorism than it does to clarify the current state of the problem itself.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">A claim that left-wing terrorism is rising — but with caveats</h3> <p>The CSIS study drew from a variety of sources that included information from the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data project, the Anti-Defamation League and media reports. Because there is no public, official, unified and comprehensive database of domestic terrorism incidents in the U.S., researchers who wish to analyze trends are required to assemble their own data sets.</p> <p>"There are a lot of ambiguities for really anyone who's trying to code terrorist attacks," said Byman. "Coding" refers to a process by which analysts apply sorting criteria to an incident to determine how it should be categorized. In the CSIS analysis, for example, there was the initial requirement to determine whether incidents even qualify as terrorism.</p> <p>"If someone draws a swastika on a synagogue, do you say that's antisemitic terrorism? We tended to focus on risk of life, so that sort of violence would not count," Byman explained. "In a more political context, the arson attacks on Tesla would not count because there doesn't seem to have been any attempt or intent to kill individual people."</p> <p>Additional coding happens after analysts compile their lists of domestic terrorism incidents. In this case, Byman and McCabe were interested in focusing on cases that, in their view, could be attributed to right-wing or left-wing motivations. During the first six months of 2025, they coded five instances as left-wing terrorism, and one as right-wing terrorism.</p> <p>But Byman said the significance of these findings has caveats.</p> <p>"Even the five [left-wing terrorist incidents] we get for the first half of 2025 — let's say that pace continues and it's 10 — that's a small number compared to right-wing terrorism when it was at its peak in recent years," Byman said. "And so the increase to me has to be taken in context."</p>
<p>In fact, Byman said that while several news outlets ran with headlines that highlighted a rise in left-wing plots and attacks, that was perhaps the less remarkable finding.</p> <p>"The decline in right-wing attacks is actually much more striking," he said.</p> <p>The single act that the CSIS study coded as right-wing terrorism during the first half of 2025 was the assassination of Minnesota state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the shooting of Minnesota state senator John Hoffman and his wife. Byman surmises the drop-off in frequency of right-wing incidents may be due to a feeling that the Trump administration has operationalized policy objectives, such as increased immigration enforcement, that previously animated violence on the right.</p> <p>But several experts within the field of counterterrorism and extremism research have raised concerns about the methodology, conclusions and timing of the study.</p> <h3 class="edTag">"Five is a really low case number"</h3> <p>For Amy Cooter, deputy director at the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism, the numbers found in the CSIS study are too small to support any robust conclusions.</p> <p>"Five is a really low case number to try to make any kind of inference from and try to say that we're having a major increase in any kind of problem," said Cooter, who co-authored a critique of the report. "Compared to historical data, almost any increase in left-wing violence is going to look like a big jump."</p> <p>By contrast, Byman and McCabe's count of right-wing terrorism tallies 144 incidents between 1994 and 2000. That suggests a rate of 12 incidents per six-month period, more than twice what they found in their analysis of left-wing terrorism during the first half of 2025.</p> <p>"The primary thing that I'm worried about with that report is how some people are already interpreting that as projecting a real threat from the left, both through the rest of 2025 and through an undefined future period as well," Cooter said. "Not only are five incidents still objectively really small, we know historically we have seen a greater number of incidents that are more reasonably coded as right-oriented."</p>
<p>Beyond the distortions that may come from small numbers, others have raised additional red flags about the study.</p> <p>"There have been methodological concerns that have been aired with that product," said Jacob Ware, research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University. "I think part of the firestorm has been people pointing out individual cases that are included or are not included."</p> <h3 class="edTag">The study of domestic terrorism is highly subjective</h3> <p>From decisions about whether a particular incident should be coded as terrorism, to discerning a perpetrator's ideology or politics, whether those beliefs ultimately motivated the violence, and the extent to which mental health issues factored in — researchers may draw different conclusions. In many cases, those determinations simply cannot be made until court cases begin, and evidence relating to the suspect's background and planning are publicly available. As a result, there's surprising variance when it comes to analyzing domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of subjectivity that goes into this," Cooter said. "Basically, it's up to teams of researchers deciding their own criteria for what counts or doesn't [in deciding what goes] into a particular dataset."</p> <p>For those reasons, Cooter and Ware said they have different assessments about some of the incidents that the CSIS study included — and excluded — in its analysis.</p> <p>"We really need to get statements or justifications, motivations from perpetrators," said Ware. "I don't think we have that in the Charlie Kirk assassination or the Minnesota assassination."</p> <p>The Kirk assassination occurred after the time span that the CSIS analysis examined, but Byman said he considers that killing to be "a very obvious example" of an additional act of left-wing terrorism in 2025. Cooter, however, said she believes any coding of the killing, at this juncture, is premature.</p> <p>"We're still waiting for more information on the Charlie Kirk shooting, quite frankly," she said.</p> <p>Ware also noted that the CSIS study left off incidents that others might call acts of left-wing terrorism. For instance, it excluded the killing of two Israeli embassy staffers outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., in May. Byman said the CSIS is adjusting how it codes violence committed in the name of Palestinian rights because of particular complexities around that issue.</p> <p>The study also left out instances where vandals damaged Tesla vehicles and charging stations. There were several such examples of this during the early months of Trump's second term, when Tesla CEO Elon Musk was heading up the administration's efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency.</p>
<p>"To me, that might qualify as an act of terrorism, if somebody is using incendiary devices against civilian targets for political purposes," Ware said.</p> <p>But the study does count the arson of 11 NYPD squad cars in June of 2025, a case that Ware said would not necessarily have made his list.</p> <p>Other high-profile instances of violence, including the murder of the CEO of United Healthcare late last year, and two apparent attempted assassinations of Donald Trump in 2024, are further testing frameworks for analyzing domestic terrorism. In the case of the health care executive, the suspect charged with the killing has been celebrated as a kind of folk hero to some on the left. But little is still known about what might have motivated the violence. With the incidents involving Trump, the motives also remain unclear.</p>
<p>Byman said it is reasonable and expected that others might arrive at different conclusions about the same events.</p> <p>"If you're changing your coding to try to be more inclusive or less inclusive, does it change your general trends?," he said. "And my take would be, no, we still see the relative increase in left-wing [terrorism], we still see the significant decrease in right-wing [terrorism], although the particular numbers, I would say, can vary depending on different legitimate coding systems."</p> <h3 class="edTag">"Salad Bar Extremism"</h3> <p>Across the field, counterterrorism and extremism researchers largely agree that in recent years, there has been an increase in violence that may be considered domestic terrorism. Many believe the increase has occurred within both the left and the right. And many agree that it is critical to achieve a firmer understanding of the source of the threat.</p> <p>"If, hypothetically, we see 90% of attacks or plots coming from people of a particular political persuasion, it doesn't make sense to evenly divide our resources across the political spectrum," Cooter said, "because that's not going to pick up on the majority of those potential threats."</p> <p>But some experts are questioning whether a left-right framework is sufficient to track the evolving nature of violence in the U.S. Former FBI director Christopher Wray often invoked the term "salad bar extremism" to refer to the disjointed assemblage of beliefs that violent actors increasingly seemed to hold. Earlier this year, the FBI established a new coding category called "nihilistic violent extremism" to capture a growing phenomenon of non-ideological crimes. And from a lethality perspective, the deadliest incident so far this year occurred on Jan. 1 when a self-radicalized Islamist perpetrator drove into a crowd on New Years Day in New Orleans, killing 14 people.</p> <p>Ware said that for him, the shift in domestic terrorism is better defined by a change in who has been targeted.</p>
<p>"Terrorism is getting more personal," he said.</p> <p>In the past, Ware said, domestic terrorists have tended to aim for higher body counts. He pointed to the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people. But recently, Ware said that attacks have been circumscribed to far fewer victims — even when there was the opportunity to kill more.</p> <p>"I think one of the really strange cases where you see this very strongly was the Washington, D.C., Capital Jewish Museum murders," he said. "[The suspect] executed two people in the street and then entered his target without launching further violence. ... It was almost like he felt he'd already achieved his goal with just those two pointblank, horrendous murders."</p>
<p>While the CSIS study has set off vigorous discussion and disagreement about the source of terrorism in the U.S., few believe that it will materially impact policy.</p> <p>"The administration is going after anti-fascist groups or networks, movements. That's not really where the violence is coming from," Ware said. "So even if the findings are correct, that doesn't mean the administration is doing the right thing with those findings."</p> <p>In fact, since Trump took office in January, some developments have elevated suspicion that this administration may go farther than simply ignoring data. In September, independent journalist Jason Paladino wrote that the Department of Justice appeared to have removed a study that found far-right extremists to be responsible for the most lethal terrorism since 1990. The study is still available through The Internet Archive. The DOJ's Office of Justice Programs did not respond to questions from NPR about this.</p> <p>Additionally, in March the Department of Homeland Security discontinued funding for the Terrorism and Targeted Violence project at the University of Maryland. That project was the only publicly available centralized data project collecting information about terrorism and targeted violence in the country. Since 2020, that database has provided information used by professionals in areas of homeland security, school safety and violence prevention.</p> <p>In response to an NPR query about the decision to discontinue its funding, a DHS spokesperson said the project had "biased and misleading data practices." It also said it "disproportionately focused on right-wing ideologies while downplaying left-wing extremism."</p> <p>Ultimately, as the administration refocuses from terrorism to counternarcotics operations and immigration enforcement, Ware said Americans are increasingly at risk.</p> <p>"We are seeing a higher drumbeat of violence across the board and now the onus shifts to the administration to be able to prevent that. And I think that is where the American people should be really concerned," he said. "Whether the violence is coming from the left or the right, the onus is on law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent it and to protect the American people. And they are not doing that right now."</p>
