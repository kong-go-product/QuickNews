<div class="article-title">Newsom bails out Planned Parenthood with $140M to keep 100 clinics open after Trump cuts</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>California officials are giving Planned Parenthood $140 million to keep 109 clinics open and offset the financial strain from cuts imposed by Republicans in Washington, Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom announced.</p><p>Newsom said the move affirms the state’s continued commitment to abortion access for women in the Golden State amid efforts by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to shut down Planned Parenthood.</p><p>"California is a reproductive freedom state, and this latest investment continues to show our belief in protecting access to essential health care in times of distress," Newsom said in a statement on Thursday. "Trump’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood put all our communities at risk as people seek basic health care from these community providers."</p><p>State lawmakers will also address the issue when the legislature reconvenes in January.</p><p>Planned Parenthood had announced it would eliminate primary care at clinics in Orange and San Bernardino counties starting in December. Five other clinics in the Bay Area, Santa Cruz and Central Valley, also shuttered in recent months over federal efforts to defund the organization.</p><p>Dr. Janet Jacobson, medical director of the Orange and San Bernardino counties clinics, told CalMatters the federal actions are "destroying our primary care program."</p><p>"It’s inhumane to take away people’s health care," Jacobson said. "Folks that have Medi-Cal should be able to see the provider of their choice for primary care."</p><p>Planned Parenthood needs about $27 million a month to operate all its local facilities, Jodi Hicks, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, told CalMatters.</p><p>"The Planned Parenthood affiliates in California are grateful to Governor Newsom and our allies in the Legislature for taking this necessary step to keep Planned Parenthood health centers open and able to provide critical services as they weather the impacts of the federal defund," Hicks said in a statement.</p><p>California is the fourth state to allocate public funds to support Planned Parenthood, joining Washington, Colorado and New Mexico. Lawmakers in Oregon and New York are also considering giving public money to the organization.</p><p>Republicans in the nation's capital and across the country have targeted Planned Parenthood over abortion services. Trump's spending bill signed over the summer prohibited Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid money for its services, including abortions, mammograms, pap smears, birth control and sexually transmitted infection testing.</p><p>Facilities in GOP-led states with abortion restrictions have also been forced to cease the procedures following the 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe V. Wade and returned the power to make laws regarding abortion back to the states.</p><p>Planned Parenthood facilities have been shuttering in various states across the country, including California and New York. Planned Parenthood Mar Monte — which operates 30 health centers along the California coast, Central Valley and Nevada — shuttered five health centers in July after Trump blocked Planned Parenthood’s funding.</p><p>Mar Monte Chief of Staff Andrew Adams said the organization is working on ways to maintain its financial stability. Adams said the closures helped keep services at the organization’s other clinics until the end of the year but that it could be met with a "financial cliff" in the new year.</p><p>"We are planning for an environment where there is no federal funding," Adams told CalMatters. "What that looks like is having to potentially charge patients some amount of money for services we provide."</p><p>The organization has claimed that abortions make up only 3% of its services, but pro-life groups contend that the clinics' closures in states with abortion bans prove that to be false.</p><p>"If that were true, they wouldn't be closing all these facilities in pro-life states where you can't do abortions. So that's hardly believable anymore in 2025," 40 Days for Life CEO and founder Shawn Carney told Fox News Digital in August.</p><p>Newsom, California lawmakers and Planned Parenthood have spent much of the year searching for a solution to keep the organization afloat without federal dollars, according to CalMatters. </p><p>But with a multibillion-dollar state deficit, that has been a challenging goal.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">NBA commissioner addresses gambling scandal for the first time</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver made his first public comments since the federal indictments of Portland coach Chauncey Billups and Miami guard Terry Rozier and former player Damon Jones in a wide-ranging gambling-related scheme.</p><p>"My initial reaction was I was deeply disturbed," Silver said in an interview during the Amazon Prime Video broadcast of the New York Knicks vs. Boston Celtics game Friday. "There’s nothing more important to the league and its fans than the integrity of the competition. I had a pit in my stomach. It was very upsetting.</p><p>"I apologize to our fans that we are all dealing with this situation."</p><p></p><p>Silver added the NBA investigated and found no reason to sanction Rozier when his case opened in March 2023 as a member of the Charlotte Hornets, and sports books alerted the NBA to irregular patterns involving Rozier’s "prop bets."</p><p>"We frankly couldn’t find anything," Silver said. "Terry at the time cooperated. He gave the league office his phone. He sat down for an interview. And we ultimately concluded that there was insufficient evidence despite that aberrational behavior to move forward.</p><p>"He still hasn’t been convicted of anything, in fairness to Terry. Obviously, it doesn’t look good. But he’s now been put on administrative leave. There’s a balance here of protecting people’s rights and investigating."</p><p>Earlier Friday, Congress got involved. </p><p>The House Committee on Commerce Friday sent a letter to Silver requesting information and a briefing to obtain information related to the scandal.</p><p>The committee is seeking five key points of information from Silver:</p><p>"1. Details about the fraudulent, illegal, and alleged betting practices in connection with NBA players, coaches, and officials, including the actions of NBA players and coaches identified in the recent indictment; as well as prior instances, some of which are identified above," the letter states.</p><p>"2. Actions the NBA intends to take to limit the disclosure of nonpublic information for illegal purposes. 3. Whether the NBA’s Code of Conduct for players and coaches effectively prohibits illegal activity, including the disclosure of non-public information for the purposes of illegal betting schemes. 4. An explanation of the gaps, if any, in existing regulations that allow illegal betting schemes to occur. 5. Whether and how the NBA is reevaluating the terms of its partnerships with sports betting companies." </p><p>The bipartisan letter was signed by six members of Congress on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.</p><p>Rozier was arrested because federal officials allege he conspired with associates to help them win bets based on his statistical performance. The charges are similar to what former Toronto player Jontay Porter faced before he was banned from the league by Silver in 2024.</p><p>Billups faces charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering for participating in what federal officials called Mafia-backed rigged poker games. He also matches the credentials of someone described only as Co-Conspirator 8 in an indictment detailing how some people gave bettors inside information on player health statuses.</p><p>The arrests have overshadowed the opening week around the league.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report. </i></p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Three former Eastern Michigan basketball players defied sports betting probe, NCAA says</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>At least three former Eastern Michigan men's basketball players refused to cooperate with the NCAA's investigation into questionable sports betting activities, the governing body of college athletics announced Friday.</p><p>Several games from the 2024-25 season fall within the probe's scope.</p><p>The NCAA imaged the personal phones of Jalin Billingsley, Da'Sean Nelson and Jalen Terry in January. The examination stemmed from unusual betting activity associated with Eastern Michigan's matchup against Central Michigan on Jan. 14, according to findings that were made available Friday.</p><p>The players opted against participating in interviews and later informed NCAA officials, via legal counsel, that they did not intend to cooperate in the investigation. The three former Eagles athletes also requested that the phone images be deleted, the release stated.</p><p>The three individuals' lack of cooperation is considered an NCAA violation and can trigger the permanent loss of eligibility. However, the players named in the probe have already exhausted their eligibility.</p><p>NCAA officials noted that the lack of cooperation stalled the investigation, as enforcement personnel could not determine whether sports gambling violations occurred.</p><p>"When individuals choose not to cooperate — particularly when cases involve potential integrity issues — those choices can and will be met with serious consequences including prohibitions on athletically related activities, the loss of eligibility and/or being publicly named in an infractions decision," a release from the Division I Committee on Infractions said.</p><p>Fox News Digital was unable to reach Terry, Nelson  Billingsley for comment Friday.</p><p>Terry's 16.6 points per game during the 2024-25 season lead the Eagles in scoring. Nelson, a former DePaul athlete who transferred to Eastern Michigan, averaged 16.1 points per contest last season. In July, Nelson reached an agreement on a contract with Swiss Basketball League's Fribourg Olympic Basket.</p><p>Including the trio of former Eastern Michigan players, 13 athletes across six different schools are under NCAA investigation for alleged sports wagering violations.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Joe Rogan says he enjoys going to church, admires Jesus Christ and benefits of faith</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Podcaster Joe Rogan praised the merits of religion, noting he enjoys going to a church and hearing about the Bible and its teachings.</p><p>During his interview with "Triggernometry" hosts Francis Foster and Konstantin Kisin, the three commentators noted the benefits of inner peace and moral certainty religion provides. After Kisin noted that he started going to church services again and genuinely enjoys it, Rogan agreed.</p><p>"I do too. It's a bunch of people that are going to try to make their lives better," he said. "They're trying to be a better person, and they're trying to — I mean for me at least, the place that I go to — they, you know, they read and analyze passages in the Bible. I'm really interested in what these people were trying to say because I don't think it's nothing."</p><p>Rogan added that he has seen many self-professed intellectuals scoff at religion and minimize it as "fairy tales," arguing this is a shallow way to look at thousands of years of accumulated human experience.</p><p>"There's a lot of, like, atheists and secular people that just like to dismiss Christianity as being foolish. You know, ‘It's just fairy tales.’ I hear that amongst, you know, self-professed intelligent people, like, ‘It's a fairy tale,’" Rogan said. </p><p>"Like, I don't know if that's true. I think there's more to it. I think it's history, but I think it's a confusing history. It's a confusing history because it was a long time ago. And it's people telling things in an oral tradition, then writing things down in a language that you don't understand in the context of a culture that you don't understand. And I think there's something to what they're saying."</p><p>Rogan noted the ubiquity of flood myths across the world and pointed out there appears to be scientific evidence for a prehistoric flood caused by comet impacts. He argued there clearly is some physical evidence for the claims made in Biblical stories.</p><p>Rogan praised Jesus Christ in particular, noting he is both a philosophically remarkable and a historically valid figure.</p><p>"Christianity in particular is the most fascinating to me because there's this one person that everybody agrees existed, that somehow or another had the best plan for how human beings should interact with each other and behave and was the best example of it and even died in a nonviolent way, like didn't even protest, died on the cross supposedly for our sins," Rogan said. "Like, it's a fascinating story."</p><p>"It's a historically documented human being," Rogan later noted, speaking about the uniqueness of the Christian messiah. "That's where it gets weird because there's a there's a universal depiction of what this human being was like. That doesn't seem to vary that much between all the people that knew him. That gets weird."</p><p>Francis Foster praised the part of the Roman Catholic Mass where worshipers wish each other peace, noting how powerful it is for some strangers to make a real human connection with a handshake and three words, "Peace be with you."</p><p>Rogan agreed on what a powerful gesture this is, arguing that people need something outside themselves and their whims to offer guidance.</p><p>"If you're just relying on your whims and your, you know, whatever you think is the moral thing to do, you know, then you know what you get? You get those people that are unable to answer the question of whether or not you should protect an unborn fetus or whether or not they have human rights," he said. </p><p>"If you have religion, you go ‘Wow, that’s a good question.'"</p><p>Foster recalled the New Atheist movement that was popular in the early 2000s and its claim that people don’t need religion.</p><p>"I think that’s fundamentally inaccurate," he said.</p><p>Kisin and Rogan both noted they had once been interested in the New Atheist movement.</p><p>"But a lot of those guys fell apart" Rogan said. "A lot of those guys get real persnickety; they don’t seem very enlightened. They don't seem like they're at peace, which is interesting."</p><p>While Rogan noted he has met Christians he agrees and disagrees with politically, he called them some of the happiest and kindest people he has met in his life. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Scandal-plagued Virginia AG hopeful’s wife reportedly donated to fund that freed accused criminals, murderers</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Virginia attorney general candidate Jay Jones faced new political fallout Friday after a report revealed his wife had donated to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, a controversial bail organization that used millions to spring violent offenders, including accused rapists and murderers, from jail.</p><p>In May 2020, during unrest in Minneapolis after George Floyd’s death, Mavis Jones posted on Twitter: "I just donated to the Minnesota Freedom Fund," linking to the group’s donation page and urging others to do the same. The account has since gone private.</p><p>The revelation, first reported by The Washington Free Beacon, comes as Jones, a Democrat, trails Republican incumbent Jason Miyares in a tightening race for Virginia’s top law enforcement post. The state’s attorney general oversees state-level prosecutions and police oversight.</p><p>The Minnesota Freedom Fund, promoted at the time by several progressive figures, including Sen. Kamala Harris, raised more than $41 million during the 2020 protests, pledging to support demonstrators arrested during clashes with police. </p><p>But a FOX 9 investigation later found the group spent most of its money bailing out defendants accused of serious violent crimes rather than low-level protest offenses.</p><p>Among those bailed out was Christopher Boswell, a twice-convicted rapist facing new kidnapping and assault charges who was freed after the fund posted $350,000 in cash bail.</p><p>The group also paid $100,000 to release Darnika Floyd, who was charged with second-degree murder, and $75,000 for Jaleel Stallings, who allegedly fired at a Minneapolis SWAT team before being acquitted at trial.</p><p>Greg Lewin, then the fund’s interim executive director, told FOX 9 that same year, "The last time we were down there, the clerk said, ‘We hate it when you bail out these sex offenders.’ I often don’t even look at a charge when I bail someone out."</p><p>In one case, the fund posted bail for George Howard, a career criminal later charged with fatally shooting a man in a Minneapolis road rage incident just weeks after his release.</p><p>The news adds to a string of controversies for Jones, 35, who has already apologized for violent text messages directed at Republican leaders. In one exchange, he wrote that then–House Speaker Todd Gilbert gets "two bullets to the head" and that Gilbert’s wife Jennifer should "watch her children die."</p><p>Court records also show Jones was convicted of reckless driving in 2022 for traveling 116 mph on a Virginia highway. He was fined $1,500 and ordered to perform 1,000 hours of community service, but a state ethics review is examining whether hours spent volunteering for his own political committee should count toward the sentence.</p><p>The latest controversy gives Miyares and Republicans new fodder in the closing weeks of the campaign. A Trafalgar Group poll released Oct. 17 found Miyares leading 49.5% to 44.6%, a reversal from earlier surveys that had Jones up six points before the text scandal broke.As of Friday, Mavis Jones has set her X account to private.</p><p>The Minnesota Freedom Fund and the Jay Jones campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Vulnerable Dem senator’s ‘grassroots’ campaign powered by out-of-state cash, mostly by coastal elites</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> Georgia Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, described by CNN as the nation's "most endangered Senate Democrat," has touted "an unstoppable grassroots coalition." But, according to the latest Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings released, his campaign is being propped up by a lot of out-of-state money.</p><p>Ossoff’s latest quarterly filing shows that more than 80% of the money he raised last period came from out-of-state donors. The report, which details contributions from individuals who have given at least $200 this cycle, also reveals that over half of his maxed-out donors hail from California, New York or the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia region.</p><p>After the release of an October filing, Ossoff's team touted in a press release that, in the face of "heavy spending from GOP Super PACs," it raised $12 million during the last third-quarter filing period that runs from July 1 through Sept. 30. </p><p>The same press release said Ossoff's "re-election juggernaut" was "overwhelmingly" powered by small donors with an average of $36 from approximately 233,000 donors. If a donor has not given an aggregate of at least $200, that donor's contribution remains undisclosed in FEC filings.</p><p>Ossoff is running for re-election in a state Trump won in 2024, albeit by a thin two-point margin. He first arrived in Congress in 2021 after defeating incumbent Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., in a razor-thin election that required a runoff. During that first election cycle, according to The Washington Free Beacon, Ossoff raised 60% of his contributions from outside the state of Georgia. </p><p>According to Ossoff's recent October FEC filing, California is leading the pack in terms of the most donations to his campaign during the third quarter, totaling about 20% of all donations. Georgia is second with about 17.5%.</p><p>But when it comes to donors who have maxed out their contribution limits, more of those political donors came from California (33.3%) New York (15.65%) and Massachusetts (10.8%) than from Georgia, which accounted for only 6.1% of maxed-out donors who contributed to Ossoff in the third quarter. </p><p>Given Ossoff’s vulnerability heading into Election Day, GOP strategists and Senate sources say the Georgia Democrat is unlikely to break with his party to vote for reopening the government, fearing it could cost him crucial support from liberal donors nationwide.</p><p>"There is no middle ground for him when it comes to these big decisions that have to be made, and I think the shutdown proves that," Ryan Mahoney, a Georgia-based GOP strategist who has worked with Republican senators in the state told The Washington Examiner.</p><p>"His calculus is, ‘Do I vote to open the government up and get crushed and can’t raise a single dollar of low-dollar money, or do I vote to shut the government down and get $3 million [from online fundraising]?’" a Democratic Party insider also told The Hill. </p><p>Ossoff's campaign declined to comment when reached for this article. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Kylie Jenner is flaunting a new haircut and a sporty side fans can’t stop talking about.</p><p>The 28-year-old mother of two shared on Instagram Thursday a series of photos of herself in a burgundy sports bra and shorts workout set with a matching Alo duffel bag. She captioned the photo, which was a joint Instagram with Alo, "fall in california @alo."</p><p>The beauty mogul struck a sultry pose as she leaned against a doorway, showing off her toned look. Three gold bangles glimmered on her wrist as she held her oversized duffel bag.</p><p>She included a selfie taken inside one of her luxury vehicles. She wore her trademark nude matte lip to complement the fall vibe of her post. One fan also noticed in the comments, "She chopped her hair omg [heart eye emoji]."</p><p>She showed off a shorter, shoulder-length cut with loose waves that framed her face.</p><p>Her matching Alo bag, which sells for $3,600 at the brand’s store, sat in the passenger seat.</p><p>Jenner's post comes just days after she marked the celebration of a decade of Kylie Cosmetics with family and friends, fueling buzz about a throwback to her "King Kylie" era.</p><p>A recent promo for her new King Kylie Cosmetics collection left fans divided, with critics describing it as "deeply out of touch."</p><p>After sharing the teaser, Jenner’s comments section lit up with excitement from fans and friends alike. Hailey Bieber wrote "exactly," while Lauren Sánchez Bezos added a raised-hands emoji. One fan exclaimed "KING KYLIE IS BACK," as another chimed in, "We’re back."</p><p>Still, not everyone was on board with the new campaign. Jenner drew criticism earlier this month after posting a short Instagram clip showing her walking handcuffed down a jail hallway surrounded by officers as part of a promo for the King Kylie relaunch. </p><p>Some social media users called the imagery "out of touch," pointing to ongoing ICE raids and protests across the country and saying the video felt tone-deaf amid renewed conversations about law enforcement.</p><p>Kylie Cosmetics first hit the scene in November 2015 with the launch of Kylie Lip Kits, three lip shades that sold out in minutes. Just a few months later, Jenner expanded the line and officially reintroduced it as Kylie Cosmetics in February 2016.</p><p>Her fans have called on the star to do a nostalgic King Kylie era that brought colorful hair, statement lips and the start of her beauty empire. She shared a tweet and selfie Oct. 10, writing, "If I just so happen to do a King Kylie collection what products would u guys like to see."</p><p>From there, the excitement sparked, and the anticipation for the revival launch only grew. She continued to tease, posting photos on Instagram cosplaying her younger self where it all began.</p><p>She also shared throwback photos in the lead-up to the 10-year exhibition pop-up in Los Angeles. She garnered excitement with the caption, "ARE YOU READY?!!!! LA!!!! WHERE IT ALL STARTED!!! FIRST OFFICIAL POP UP IN 7 YEARS TO CELEBRATE 10 YEARS OF KYLIE COSMETICS!!!!! @kyliecosmetics."</p><p>At its peak, Kylie Cosmetics was valued at $1.2 billion, solidifying Jenner as the youngest "self-made" billionaire in 2019 at age 21, according to Forbes. </p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Fans at the Rogers Centre in Toronto loudly booed Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani ahead of Game 1 of the World Series Friday. </p><p>While it is common for fans to jeer opposing players during pregame lineups, the boos that serenaded Ohtani were uniquely loud compared to those for his Dodgers teammates. </p><p>Ohtani didn't quiet the crowd either when he came up for his first plate appearance of the game, striking out to lead off the first inning. </p><p>When Ohtani entered free agency in the winter of 2023, he visited the Blue Jays as a potential suitor before signing with the Dodgers. </p><p>The Blue Jays gave Ohtani a hat and a jacket for Decoy, Ohtani’s dog. Blue Jays manager John Schneider joked he would like both of those gifts back.</p><p>"I hope he brought his hat, the Blue Jay hat that he took from us in our meeting. I hope he brought it back, finally," Schneider said Thursday.</p><p>"And the jacket for Decoy," he added. "It’s like, ‘Give us our stuff back already.’"</p><p>Ohtani smiled when he heard about Schneider’s remarks and simply said through a translator, "It’s in my garage."</p><p>The Blue Jays manager said he wasn’t sure how close the team came to signing the Japanese superstar. </p><p>"When we met with him, you felt good about it, and you felt good about the feedback he was giving about our organization and opportunity here," Schneider said. </p><p>"But you never really know what a player’s feeling in free agency, and there’s a lot of things that have to line up for them personally, too. So, you can’t really think about what if. You think about the 26 (players) that we have."</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Palantir CEO defends support of Trump, addresses claims he's gone 'full MAGA'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Palantir CEO Alex Karp defended his support of President Donald Trump against detractors in an exclusive interview on "The Claman Countdown" Thursday.</p><p>"I’m really supportive of the president’s, you know, border and national security thing," Karp said. "Those are the only two things that I actually focus on."  </p><p>Karp's defense of his support of Trump comes ahead of the anticipated Nov. 4 release of a new book about the tech leader and Palantir. Axios reports the book, written by journalist Michael Steinberger, traces how Karp went from a self-described progressive to going "full MAGA."</p><p>Although the Palantir CEO called the biography "mostly true" but "not all true," he argued its author has a little bit of "Trump Derangement Syndrome."</p><p>"I support the president a lot, and [the author] thinks I've gone nuts," Karp explained. </p><p>Karp argued Trump deserves credit for several major accomplishments.</p><p>"And I think these people that can't learn, at what point can you acknowledge the accomplishments?" he asked. "Like, these are really — like getting the peace deal, closing the border, degrading Iran — are world-historic accomplishments.</p><p>"And I don't see why you wouldn't acknowledge that," Karp continued. "But, of course, you know, to many people, if you acknowledge the obvious and extraordinary accomplishments, they think you're deranged."</p><p>As the first U.S. CEO to go to Ukraine, Karp revealed what makes him "really respect" Trump.</p><p>"[Trump] is actually a peace president," Karp stated. "At Palantir, the idea, and just to what I very much support, is, you know, you want to be so strong that there are no wars. Wars really, really are bad."</p><p>He explained why he remains hopeful of a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia despite warning it will "cost" many lives.</p><p>"As we’ve seen, the president is fully engaged," Karp said. "But I am proud that we're able to support [the Ukrainians]. And they're very, very tough people. I think they will continue fighting until they can reach something that they feel they can accept."</p><p>President Trump called off an anticipated meeting in Budapest, Hungary, with Russian President Vladimir Putin because he didn’t see enough progress toward peace. However, a future summit hasn’t been ruled out, the White House said.</p><p>While Trump and Putin spoke over the phone Oct. 16, plans for the meeting were scrapped after Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov Tuesday.</p><p>Trump also has imposed new sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies in an attempt to pressure the Kremlin without committing to deeper U.S. involvement in Ukraine’s war.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump scores legal win, getting lawsuit against Iowa pollster, Des Moines Register moved to state court</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> — President Donald Trump notched a legal victory Friday in his lawsuit against Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer and The Des Moines Register, and the case will now land in Iowa State Court after an appeals court sided with the president and ruled a lower court had overstepped.</p><p>Trump’s legal team, which has accused the defendants of "brazen election interference" with their final 2024 Iowa presidential poll that showed him trailing Democrat Kamala Harris, originally requested the case be moved to Iowa State Court in May after the defendants "removed" the case to federal court. </p><p>A federal judge denied the request at the time, but the Obama-appointed judge was overruled by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit.</p><p>In a sharply worded opinion, the 8th Circuit granted Trump’s petition for a writ of mandamus — a rare judicial order used to correct clear legal errors — and directed a district judge to treat the case as dismissed "without prejudice," allowing Trump to refile the case.</p><p>"Today’s just and appropriate ruling by the 8th Circuit ensures that President Trump’s powerhouse case focused on the fake election interfering polls conducted and denominated by J. Ann Selzer, The Des Moines Register and its corporate owner Gannett will be litigated in Iowa State Court where it belongs," a spokesman for Trump’s legal team told Fox News Digital. </p><p>"These defendants have repeatedly engaged in unlawful gamesmanship to avoid State Court, and that ends today," the spokesman continued. "President Trump will continue to hold those who traffic in fake news, lies and smears to account."</p><p>Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), who represents Selzer, issued a statement. </p><p>"The 8th Circuit ruling was focused entirely on a technical point of civil procedure and said nothing about the merits of the case. This case is every bit as frivolous today as it was yesterday, and that fact will be borne out in whatever forum it is finally resolved," Corn-Revere told Fox News Digital. </p><p>Lark-Marie Antón, a spokesperson for The Des Moines Register's parent company, Gannett, believes the case belongs in federal court. </p><p>"We are assessing the court’s decision. Given the nature of the case and that it involves the president of the United States as a plaintiff, we continue to believe the federal courts are the most appropriate forum for this lawsuit. In the event the suit is heard by the state courts of Iowa, we have confidence the matter will be adjudicated fairly," Antón told Fox News Digital. </p><p>The lawsuit was originally filed in December in Polk County, Iowa, and sought what it calls "accountability for brazen election interference committed by" The Des Moines Register and Selzer "in favor of now-defeated former Democrat candidate Kamala Harris through use of a leaked and manipulated Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll" published Nov. 2, 2024.</p><p>"The Harris Poll was no ‘miss’ but rather an attempt to influence the outcome of the 2024 Presidential Election," the lawsuit stated at the time, adding that "defendants and their cohorts in the Democrat Party hoped that the Harris Poll would create a false narrative of inevitability for Harris in the final week of the 2024 Presidential Election." </p><p>Selzer released her final Des Moines Register-sponsored poll showing Harris leading Trump by three points in Iowa just three days before the election. That shock poll showed a seven-point shift from Trump to Harris from September, when he had a four-point lead over the vice president in the same poll.</p><p>Selzer’s poll was hyped up by the media in the days leading up to the election as her polling predictions had been historically accurate. Many suggested it implied a monumental shift in Midwest support for Harris in a red state, but the poll turned out to be way off.</p><p>Trump thumped Harris in Iowa by more than 13 percentage points, the third straight time he'd won the state and the first time any candidate had won there by double digits since 1980.</p><p>Shortly after the election, Selzer announced she was done with election polling and moving on to "other ventures."</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Lindsay Kornick and Brooke Singman contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Congress seeks answers from NBA commissioner amid widening gambling scandal</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Congress is seeking information related to the recent FBI investigation into gambling and game fixing that resulted in the arrest of three current and former players. </p><p>The House Committee on Commerce Friday sent a letter to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver requesting information and a briefing to obtain information related to the scandal that resulted in the federal indictment of Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA player and coach Damon Jones. </p><p>The bipartisan letter was signed by six members of Congress on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.</p><p></p><p>The committee is seeking five key points of information from Silver:</p><p>"1. Details about the fraudulent, illegal, and alleged betting practices in connection with NBA players, coaches, and officials, including the actions of NBA players and coaches identified in the recent indictment; as well as prior instances, some of which are identified above," the letter states.</p><p>"2. Actions the NBA intends to take to limit the disclosure of nonpublic information for illegal purposes. 3. Whether the NBA’s Code of Conduct for players and coaches effectively prohibits illegal activity, including the disclosure of non-public information for the purposes of illegal betting schemes. 4. An explanation of the gaps, if any, in existing regulations that allow illegal betting schemes to occur. 5. Whether and how the NBA is reevaluating the terms of its partnerships with sports betting companies." </p><p>The letter also references comments made by Silver during an appearance Tuesday on ESPN's "The Pat McAfee Show," where the commissioner expressed support for more federal sports betting regulation. </p><p>"I think, probably, there should be more regulation, frankly," Silver said. "I wish there was federal legislation rather than state by state. I think you've got to monitor the amount of promotion, the amount of advertising around it."</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to the NBA for a response to the letter. </p><p>The Department of Justice listed seven NBA games that saw high-stakes wagers after non-public information was disclosed to gamblers.</p><p>Rozier's alleged involvement came in a game March 23, 2023, when he told a childhood friend, Deniro Laster, that he would take himself out of a game early, citing an injury, so Laster could place wagers based on the information. Neither Hornets officials nor betting companies were made aware of Rozier's plan, according to the indictment, and Rozier was not listed on the team's injury report.</p><p>Laster then allegedly sold that information to other co-conspirators, and numerous people placed wagers totaling roughly $200,000 on Rozier's "under" prop bets to hit in both parlay and straight wagers. After Rozier played just nine minutes and never returned, the bets won. Rozier and Laster counted cash winnings at Rozier's home in Charlotte roughly a week later, an indictment says.</p><p>The DOJ says the player was eventually ruled out with a lower-body injury. LeBron James did not play that night due to an ankle injury that kept him out for two more games. The game in question was played two days after James scored 38 points to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer.</p><p>Another game the DOJ mentioned was a Portland Trail Blazers–Chicago Bulls matchup March 24, 2023, the day after Rozier played nine minutes, and a co-conspirator, "an NBA coach at the time," allegedly told a longtime friend, who is also a defendant in the rigged poker scheme, that the Blazers would be "tanking" that night for a better draft pick and would sit some of the team's best players. The resting of the players had not yet been public information.</p><p>Rozier and Jones were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The NBA announced that Rozier and Billups were placed on immediate leave from their teams, "and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities."</p><p>"The integrity of our game remains our top priority," the NBA said.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Police at the University of New Mexico (UNM) arrested a man who allegedly tried to steal Turning Point USA signs during a campus tabling event and said that "Kirk got shot in the neck for a reason," referring to slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p><p>A post Thursday from Frontlines TPUSA, the official "on-the-ground national coverage" account for Turning Point USA, shared a video of the incident on X, formerly Twitter, writing: "WATCH: 'Kirk got shot in the neck for a reason.' University of New Mexico police arrested a student who attempted to steal signs from a Turning Point USA student tabling event. The student resisted arrest but was ultimately taken into custody."</p><p>In the video of the incident, a masked man argues with people at the Turning Point USA table, objecting to their buttons about criticizing socialism. At one point, when invited to debate his views, the man said, "You're doing the Kirk bulls---. Kirk got shot in the neck for a reason."</p><p>"Whoa," a woman replied. "That's not cool at all. Charlie was a father and a husband."</p><p>"So are a lot of socialists," he replied.</p><p>The man added that Kirk promoted violence before taking the Turning Point USA signs. The Turning Point USA video is edited, so it's not clear what transpired before he is seen being arrested by campus police.</p><p>In a statement to Fox News Digital, Ben Cloutier, executive director of strategic communications for the University of New Mexico, said, "The University of New Mexico is firmly committed to the principles of free speech and values its role as a public square for debate, a marketplace of ideas, and a place to test and challenge competing viewpoints and opinions."</p><p>Cloutier added that the university "remains dedicated to protecting constitutionally protected expression while ensuring the safety of our campus community."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the University of New Mexico Turning Point USA chapter and the University of New Mexico Police for comment.</p><p>A memorial for Kirk was held on Sept. 13 on the university's campus.</p><p>The 31-year-old co-founder and CEO of Turning Point USA was shot and killed on Sept. 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University during his American Comeback Tour.</p><p>Since Kirk’s death, requests for new TPUSA chapters have surged nationwide.</p><p>According to the organization, more than 120,000 students have inquired about launching new high school and college chapters in the weeks since Kirk’s assassination.</p></body></div></body></html>

In response, Trump announced the U.S. would impose a new 100% tariff on all Chinese goods, which is slated to take effect Nov. 1.</p><p>Even so, Trump sought to diffuse tensions and has routinely touted his relationship with Xi in recent weeks. Additionally, he has voiced confidence both parties will walk away from the summit pleased and that a deal will be made.</p><p>"I think we are going to come out very well, and everyone’s going to be very happy," Trump said Thursday.</p><p>The summit between Trump and Xi will mark the first time they’ve met in person since Trump took office in January. The two previously met in person in June 2019 in Japan.</p><p>Trump’s meeting with Xi will come on the tail end of a larger trip to the region.

<div class="article-title">Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell defends choice to keep Carson Wentz in blowout loss for prolonged period</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Los Angeles Chargers dominated the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday night. The 37-10 defeat dropped the Vikings' record to 3-4. </p><p>But much of the postgame chatter focused on coach Kevin O'Connell's decision not to pull quarterback Carson Wentz from the blowout. </p><p>Wentz was dealing with some discomfort in his non-throwing shoulder. He was sacked five times on Thursday, which appeared to further aggravate the shoulder he was already nursing. The shoulder issue, coupled with the scoreboard, raised concerns about keeping the veteran quarterback on the field longer than many perceived as necessary.</p><p>Wentz was noticeably grimacing throughout the majority of the game.  </p><p>After the game, O'Connell explained his decision to stick with Wentz for most of the game.</p><p>"We kept on checking in [with Wentz]," the coach told reporters. "Maybe getting Max [Brosmer] ready to go. Tyler [vice president of player health and performance, Tyler Williams] was coming to me a lot tonight, but every time he seemed to update me on that. Carson was sore going into it. He took obviously quite a few hits—but he was able to—I asked him multiple times where he was at and he said he was good and wanted to keep going."</p><p>"It did seem like he was in pain there a couple times."</p><p>J.J. McCarthy was inactive Thursday. The second-year quarterback started the first two games of the season but has been sidelined since then with an ankle injury. </p><p>O'Connell did note that McCarthy would return to the starting lineup against the Detroit Lions in Week 9 if he is fully recovered, the NFL Network reported.</p><p>Game cameras showed Wentz slamming his helmet on the Vikings' sideline out of apparent frustration. Wentz later made it clear that the injury ultimately did not hamper his throwing ability. </p><p>"I don't think so," Wentz said. "I don't think throwing wise. That's honestly why I felt confident to go. I felt I could do my job. I thought I could throw the ball. Thankfully, you don't need your left shoulder all that much to throw the football. So mechanically, throwing wise, I felt like I could do everything I needed to do."</p><p>Reserve quarterback Max Brosmer briefly entered Thursday’s contest, completing three of his four pass attempts in the fourth quarter.</p><p>O'Connell acknowledged that he had considered inserting the rookie signal-caller earlier in the game.</p><p>"Yeah we did," O'Connell said. "Carson's a veteran player. He understands, kind of, some of our circumstances tonight. I think it's very difficult to ask a rookie to go in there for his first performance and have to be kind of weathering it a little bit for the group.</p><p>"I did think about that at different times in the game but at the same time, the confidence we have in Max and the upside we see in Max is real. You also don't want to send him out there and force a level of figure-it-outness that's probably beyond a guy playing for the first time."</p><p>The Vikings have now dropped back-to-back games.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has doubled down on comments he made about migration, saying many Germans and Europeans are "afraid to move around in public spaces."</p><p>Merz has rejected criticism from some German political circles over his government’s tough stance on illegal immigration.</p><p>"But we still have this problem in the cityscape, of course, and that’s why the federal interior minister is facilitating and carrying out large-scale deportations," he said during a visit to Potsdam last week.</p><p>The statement prompted backlash, some accusing the German leader of being racist. He rejected the criticism while on the sidelines of a summit on the Western Balkans in London, saying migrants were "an indispensable part of our labor market," German-based DW News reported.</p><p>He also claimed that many people in Germany and across Europe are nonetheless "afraid to move around in public spaces" because of migrants "who do not have permanent residence status, do not work and do not abide by our rules," the outlet reported.</p><p>"I don’t know whether you have children. If you do, and there are daughters among them, ask your daughters what I might have meant. I suspect you’ll get a pretty clear and unambiguous answer. There’s nothing I need to retract," he said when asked if he would withdraw his earlier remarks.</p><p>Some have signed a petition disputing Merz’s comments. The signees include actor Marie Nasemann and environmental activist Luisa Neubauer.</p><p>"There are approximately 40 million daughters in this country. We have a genuine interest in ensuring that our safety is taken seriously," Neubauer wrote on Instagram. "What we are not interested in is being misused as a pretext or justification for statements that were ultimately discriminatory, racist and deeply hurtful."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The NFL assessed some hefty fines against the New York Giants after head coach Brian Daboll and running back Cam Skattebo violated the league’s concussion protocol.</p><p>During the Giants’ Week 6 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, quarterback Jaxson Dart was taken into the blue medical tent for a concussion evaluation. While Dart was being examined, Daboll and Skattebo both peeked into the tent to check on the rookie quarterback.</p><p>The interruptions during the examination proved costly, as the NFL fined the Giants $200,000, Daboll $100,000, and Skattebo $15,000 for violating the league’s concussion protocol, the NFL and NFLPA announced in a joint statement Friday.</p><p>"Their conduct was inconsistent with and demonstrated a disregard for the concussion protocol’s requirements and therefore constituted a violation," the statement read. </p><p>In the NFL-NFLPA’s joint statement, they noted that Daboll and Skattebo did not have any impact on the exam or care of Dart. The investigation also said that the Giants "undertook immediate remedial steps" to prevent a similar incident from occurring again. </p><p>The statement said the Giants fully cooperated with the NFL and NFLPA’s joint investigation. </p><p>The fines come after the team’s inexplicable fourth-quarter collapse to the Denver Broncos, during which they allowed 33 points in the final frame and missed two extra points in the loss. The heartbreaking loss dropped the Giants to 2-5 on the season, and to 2-2 in games where Dart started. </p><p>The team will look to rally, and avoid any additional fines for violating the concussion protocol when they play the Eagles (5-2) again on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>After Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier and Damon Jones were arrested Thursday, one of the most prominent figures sports gambling said he suspects more arrests may be on the way.</p><p>Art Schlichter, the fourth overall pick of the 1982 NFL Draft whose career was marred by a gambling addiction, predicted in a recent appearance with OutKick that "probably many players" have been involved in sports gambling incidents, and Thursday's indictments may be "the start of something big."</p><p>"I think you're gonna find out that probably many players have done this. More so in college, because they don't make the money NBA players do," Schlichter told OutKick host Dan Dakich. </p><p></p><p>"When I see the smaller colleges, smaller universities, having players behind games for just a few hundred dollars, it just shows you how widespread it can get. Before it's all over with, I just think it's gonna blow up,</p><p>"I think a lot of players are shivering right now worrying about this."</p><p>Yet, Schlichter was "bewildered" why Billups, or any professional, would find himself in this position.</p><p>"I just don't understand it. These guys are making millions and millions of dollars. I just don't know why they would risk their careers like that to do that. I don't know if they got an addiction or not, or if they think they're better than the law or NBA or whatever. It shocks me that they would take that risk. Especially the pro guys," he said.</p><p>Schlichter starred at Ohio State, where his gambling addiction began. Throughout his adult life, Schlichter has been in and out of legal trouble from gambling and drugs. He served 10 years in prison from 2011 through 2021 on gambling-related theft and public indecency charges and admitted he had stolen an estimated $1.5 million for gaming costs and debts.</p><p>Billups, Rozier and Jones, the latter of whom is a defendant in both cases, were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The NBA announced that Billups and Rozier were placed on immediate leave from their teams, "and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities."</p><p>"The integrity of our game remains our top priority," the NBA said.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s comments calling for the arrest of federal ICE agents drew fiery criticism Friday and a letter of warning from the Trump administration. </p><p>Rep. Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement earlier this week that local police could "arrest federal agents if they break California law."</p><p>"And if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them," Pelosi and Rep. Kevin Mullin said in a joint statement.</p><p>Rep. Pelosi’s warning is part of a growing effort among Democrats to challenge federal immigration enforcement as the Trump administration intensifies its crackdown.</p><p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche pushed back. He said local officers have no authority to detain federal officers carrying out their duties.</p><p>"You cannot touch federal agents when they’re doing their job," Blanche said on "Fox &amp; Friends" Friday.</p><p>"That’s something that they know. It’s something that we reminded them of last night, because if you do, you’re committing a crime."</p><p>Blanche was referring to a letter he sent Thursday to top California officials, including Pelosi and Gov. Gavin Newsom, warning them not to interfere with federal law enforcement operations. The letter stated that arresting federal agents during official duties is "illegal and futile."</p><p>Pelosi’s comments follow similar criticism of ICE operations from other Democratic leaders, including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.</p><p>"If you're an ICE agent, and you do these things, we think you ought to be held accountable. And yet no one in Washington, no one above them, no supervisor, no inspector general is holding anybody accountable," Pritzker said on "Special Report" Thursday.</p><p>"There literally haven't been any suspensions or firings for the terrible things that they've done," he added.</p><p>Blanche said the comments from Pelosi and Pritzker undermine the administration’s mission to make the country safer.</p><p>"What the congresswoman did yesterday, what the governor of Illinois said yesterday, does nothing but harm this country," Blanche said.</p><p>Pritzker also accused ICE agents of racial profiling rather than focusing on removing violent criminals.</p><p>Blanche rejected that claim, defending the agency’s actions and calling the accusations "disgusting."</p><p>"Our law enforcement officers are not violating the Constitution," Blanche said.</p><p>"These false claims that our ICE agents, that our federal law enforcement officers are somehow racial profiling or doing the wrong thing in executing and doing their jobs. And courts have said that we're right, and the Democrats are wrong."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump calls for prosecution of more political foes including Smith and Garland</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump late Friday pushed for several Biden-era Justice Department officials to be prosecuted over an FBI investigation into the fallout of the 2020 election.</p><p>In a Truth Social post, Mr. Trump accused four high-ranking officials — former Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray, special counsel Jack Smith and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco — of signing off on an FBI probe in which investigators allegedly looked at nine Republican lawmakers' phone records.</p><p>"These Radical Left Lunatics should be prosecuted for their illegal and highly unethical behavior!" the president wrote. He did not specify what crimes he believes they committed.</p><p>The message marks the latest instance of Mr. Trump urging the prosecution of his political foes. Last month, he pushed Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff. Since then, Comey and James have been criminally indicted.</p><p>The GOP-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee <span class="link">revealed earlier this month</span> that the FBI obtained phone data for about eight GOP senators and one GOP representative in 2023 as part of Arctic Frost, an investigation into Mr. Trump and his allies' attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the judiciary panel, released documents that appeared to indicate Wray, Garland and Monaco approved the opening of the Arctic Frost probe in the spring of 2022. Later that year, Garland appointed Smith to independently oversee the criminal investigations into Mr. Trump. </p><p>In Friday's post, Mr. Trump alleged the four former officials "spied on Senators and Congressmen/women, and even taped their calls" — though the Judiciary Committee said in a statement earlier this month the records obtained by the FBI didn't include the content of calls. Instead, the data covered who the lawmakers called and when, and the length of their calls.</p><p>The president also claimed — without evidence — they "cheated and rigged the 2020 Presidential Election."</p><p>CBS News has reached out to representatives for Smith, Garland and Monaco for comment.</p>
<p>Grassley excoriated the FBI over its handling of Arctic Frost earlier this month, calling the revelations about lawmakers' phone records "disturbing and outrageous" and part of a pattern of "weaponization" that was "arguably worse than Watergate."</p><p>Smith's attorneys <span class="link">called his actions</span> "entirely lawful, proper and consistent with established Department of Justice policy" in a letter to Grassley earlier this week.</p><p>The phone records that were scrutinized by the FBI covered several days both before and after Jan. 6, 2021, when Mr. Trump pressed lawmakers to vote against certifying former President Joe Biden's election win. The gambit was unsuccessful as Congress ended up voting to certify, but the process was interrupted by rioting at the Capitol.</p><p>Mr. Trump was <span class="link">charged by Smith's team</span> in August 2023 for conspiring to overturn the results, but <span class="link">the case was abandoned</span> after Mr. Trump's win the following year because of a Justice Department legal opinion that states sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution. </p><p>Smith's investigation delved into phone calls between lawmakers and the president on the evening of Jan. 6, which Smith alleged were part of a last-ditch attempt to talk congressional Republicans into blocking Biden's victory. The 2023 indictment against Mr. Trump lists several attempts by him and his alleged co-conspirators to reach lawmakers by phone. It argued the president "attempted to exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol by calling lawmakers to convince them, based on knowingly false claims of election fraud, to delay the certification."</p><p>Last year, a final report penned by Smith also pointed to phone calls placed by Mr. Trump and members of his circle. It cited toll records from two unindicted co-conspirators who are unnamed, one of them widely believed to be Rudy Giuliani.</p><p>Mr. Trump has lashed out at the federal officials who investigated him in the past.</p>
<p>His legal team <span class="link">has asked the Justice Department</span> to pay him about $230 million to settle federal damage claims over two investigations into him, CBS News confirmed this week. Those claims focus on the Trump-Russia probe from his first term and the criminal case against Mr. Trump for allegedly mishandling classified documents, which was pursued by Smith.</p><p>And a federal watchdog office <span class="link">launched an investigation</span> into Smith for alleged illegal political activity earlier this year. Smith's attorneys <span class="link">called the claims</span> "imaginary and unfounded."</p>

<div class="article-title">What donors to Trump's White House ballroom stand to gain from the federal government</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Dozens of executives and companies have donated to fund the construction of President Trump's $300 million ballroom, as many of them eye favorable policy, reduced scrutiny or approval for major deals from the White House. </p><p>Donors to the ballroom — which will take the place of the White House's East Wing — include Big Tech companies, defense contractors and other large corporations. The White House has not disclosed how much money each company donated. Mr. Trump has said construction will be funded through private donations and his own money — not taxpayer funds. </p><p>Speaking to reporters Friday night as he was departing for an Asia trip, Mr. Trump said that "more than $350 million" had been raised so far.</p><p>CBS News reviewed a list of 37 donors provided by the White House, which included tech firms like Google and Amazon and crypto companies like Ripple and Coinbase. Others that contributed to the project include Nvidia, Susquehanna International Group and ExtremityCare, according to sources familiar with the matter. The president hosted a dinner last week thanking donors, although not everyone invited to the dinner contributed.</p><p>Asked for comment on whether these donations present any conflicts, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a statement to CBS News: "The same critics who are wrongly claiming there are conflicts of interests, would complain if taxpayers were footing the bill."</p>
<p>"The donors for the White House ballroom project represent a wide array of great American companies and generous individuals, all of whom are contributing to make the People's House better for generations to come," she added.</p><p>Here's a closer look at what some of the donors and dinner guests stand to gain from federal policy or have already received from the administration.</p><h2>Big Tech and telecom </h2><p>Tech giants Google, Palantir, Amazon and Microsoft, as well as cell phone carrier T-Mobile, were among the donors listed by the White House.</p><p>YouTube, owned by Google, agreed to pay <span class="link">$22 million</span> toward the ballroom project as part of a legal settlement in a case Mr. Trump brought against the company for temporarily removing him from the platform after the 2021 Capitol riot. </p>
<p>Software company Palantir has been awarded more than $800 million across several government contracts in fiscal year 2025, more than in any prior year, according to federal contract data. The Trump administration has also made Palantir a key player in managing and consolidating data about Americans between federal agencies, The New York Times reported. </p><p>Amazon and Microsoft also have each received hundreds of millions in government contracts, federal data show.</p><p>T-Mobile may stand to benefit from a Trump Organization-linked mobile phone and cell service company, something House Democrats have expressed conflict-of-interest concerns over. The company isn't run by the Trump Organization, but is licensing the president's name. The Trump Mobile network says it is run on Liberty Mobile Wireless, a mobile virtual network operator that rents bandwidth from major carriers like T-Mobile.</p><p>In a statement to CBS News, a T-Mobile spokesperson said the company donated to the <span class="link">Trust for the National Mall</span>, which is handling ballroom donations, but has "no role in the use of those funds or decisions related to the construction of the ballroom." The spokesperson did not comment on the Trump-linked cell service company. </p><p>Representatives from Nvidia, one of the world's leading developers of advanced microchips, were among dozens of donors invited to Mr. Trump's thank-you dinner, according to a guest list obtained by CBS News.</p><p>The Trump administration <span class="link">granted Nvidia</span> export licenses to send certain chips to China in exchange for 15% of the revenues, as the company's CEO presses for greater access to the Chinese market. Nvidia is also waiting for the administration's full approval to ship hundreds of thousands of its artificial intelligence chips to the United Arab Emirates annually, though the administration gave the company permission to export to American businesses operating in the Gulf country earlier this month, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>Jeff Yass, who cofounded the trading firm Susquehanna International Group and invested in TikTok, was also on the guest list. Yass has given more than $16 million to super PAC MAGA Inc. this year. In his first term, Mr. Trump sought to ban TikTok, but he reversed course this year, signing an order <span class="link">last month</span> to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. with a slate of American investors. Meanwhile, Yass's wealth has surged by billions of dollars this year, according to estimates by Bloomberg and Forbes.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency</h2><p>Some of the biggest names in crypto also made donations to Mr. Trump's ballroom, according to the White House's list of donors. The Trump administration has vowed to make the U.S. the "crypto capital of the world," as the president's family has made <span class="link">billions</span> on their own crypto ventures.</p><p>A company spokesman confirmed Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, made a donation. The company is seeking Securities and Exchange Commission approval to offer blockchain-based stocks. It also faces an SEC investigation started under former President Joe Biden into whether it misstated its user numbers in past financial disclosures, The New York Times reported. Earlier this year, the SEC withdrew a separate lawsuit against Coinbase, shortly after the company donated $1 million to Mr. Trump's inauguration.  </p><p>Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, twin brothers who own crypto exchange Gemini, also helped pay for the event space. In February, the SEC closed a long-running investigation into their crypto exchange, Cameron Winklevoss announced on X, after the Winklevoss twins donated more than $2 million to MAGA Inc. one month prior. In July, the brothers successfully lobbied Mr. Trump to withdraw his original nominee to run the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates crypto, according to Politico.</p><p>The crypto company Ripple also donated. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has openly expressed his support for the current administration's cryptocurrency policies, and Mr. Trump has promoted its coin, XRP, as one of the coins that a planned U.S. government-controlled crypto reserve should include. </p><h2>Defense and federal contractors</h2><p>Lockheed Martin <span class="link">donated</span> over $10 million to Mr. Trump's ballroom, according to company sources. The defense contractor is typically awarded tens of billions annually in federal contracts.</p><p>Booz Allen Hamilton also made a donation to the president's event space. The consulting firm typically generates 98% of its annual revenue from contracts with the U.S. government, but it has suffered from the Trump administration's crackdown on federal spending. Its government contracts shrunk by 20% in the fiscal year 2025, and its stock price has plunged 46% since Mr. Trump's reelection. </p><h2>Media</h2><p>Comcast has expressed interest in acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery, Bloomberg reported, but its merger would face federal scrutiny. The Department of Justice blocked a Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger in 2015, because it would have made the conglomerate an "unavoidable gatekeeper" for Internet-based services. Comcast doesn't historically have the favor of the president; in April on Truth Social, Mr. Trump called Comcast, which owns NBC and is spinning off MSNBC, a "disgrace to the integrity of broadcasting." </p>
<h2>Medical </h2><p>Biotech company ExtremityCare's CEOs were on the thank-you dinner guest list. The company, which makes costly human cell and tissue medical products, previously donated $5 million to MAGA Inc. Soon after the donation, the Trump administration moved to delay a Biden administration plan to limit Medicare's coverage of the company's "skin substitute" bandages. </p><p>CBS News has requested comment from the companies listed in this story.</p>

<div class="article-title">NBA commissioner "deeply disturbed" by gambling arrests of Billups, Rozier</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, in his first public comments <span class="link">since the arrests</span> of Portland coach Chauncey Billups and Miami guard Terry Rozier on gambling-related charges, said Friday night that he was stunned by the indictments that have rocked the league.</p><p>"My initial reaction was I was deeply disturbed," Silver said on Amazon Prime Video, during the streaming service's first broadcast — Boston at New York. "There's nothing more important to the league and its fans than the integrity of the competition. I had a pit in my stomach. It was very upsetting."</p><p>Such was a sentiment shared by many around the league on Friday, one day after the indictments were unsealed <span class="link">and nearly three dozen people</span> — most notably, Billups and Rozier — were arrested by federal officials.</p><p>Rozier was arrested because federal officials allege he conspired with associates to help them win bets based on his statistical performance. The charges are similar to what former Toronto player Jontay Porter faced before he was banned from the league by Silver in 2024.</p><p>Rozier's attorney, James Trusty, told CBS News in a statement Thursday that Rozier had been characterized as a subject, not a target, of investigators, but then "at 6 a.m. this morning they called to tell me FBI agents were trying to arrest him in a hotel." Trusty accused federal prosecutors of wanting "the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk."</p>
<p>Billups faces charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering for participating in what federal officials called Mafia-backed, rigged poker games. He also matches the credentials of someone described only as Co-Conspirator 8 in an indictment detailing how some people gave bettors inside information on player health statuses.</p><p>In a statement provided to CBS News Thursday night, an attorney for Billups wrote that "to believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his hall-of-fame legacy, his reputation, and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game. Billups has never and would never gamble on basketball games, provide insider information, or sacrifice the trust of his team and the League, as it would tarnish the game he has devoted his entire life to."</p><p>The arrests have overshadowed the opening week around the league.</p><p>"I apologize to our fans that we are all dealing with this situation," Silver said during the in-game interview.</p>
<p>The Rozier case has gone on since March 23, 2023. He was with the Charlotte Hornets at that time, and sportsbooks — legal ones — alerted the NBA to irregular patterns involving Rozier's "prop bets" that day. Rozier went on to play about 9 1/2 minutes, and those who bet that he would underperform the listed stat lines won those wagers. Federal officials said more than $200,000 was bet on those lines alone.</p><p>The NBA investigated and found no reason to sanction Rozier, Silver said.</p><p>"We frankly couldn't find anything," Silver said. "Terry at the time cooperated. He gave the league office his phone. He sat down for an interview. And we ultimately concluded that there was insufficient evidence despite that aberrational behavior to move forward.</p><p>"He still hasn't been convicted of anything, in fairness to Terry. Obviously, it doesn't look good. But he's now been put on administrative leave. There's a balance here of protecting people's rights and investigating."</p><p>Los Angeles Clippers coach Tyronn Lue calls Billups his best friend and said the news was difficult to take. He said he spoke with Billups on Thursday night and was encouraged by what he heard.</p><p>"To go through something like this, the allegations, his family, my goddaughters, it was a tough day," Lue said. "You never want to see your friends go through anything like that."</p><p>Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers started in the NBA as a player more than 40 years ago. He's seen plenty of good and bad. He thought he had heard it all. That is, until now.</p>
<p>"It's really sad," Rivers said Friday.</p><p>Along with Billups and Rozier, former NBA player Damon Jones now faces charges because officials said he tipped off bettors about the health status of two Los Angeles Lakers players. The details in that indictment clearly show that Jones was discussing the availability of LeBron James and former Lakers center Anthony Davis with bettors before their statuses for certain games was known publicly. There is no indication that James or Davis had any knowledge of what Jones was alleged to be doing.</p><p>"We see now what those things can turn into and how they can spread, just how valuable this information is," Detroit coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. "It's a difficult situation overall but once you introduce gambling that the sports world has now, there's going to be some very dangerous situations out there for everybody — from a security standpoint, from this type of thing standpoint."</p><p>All teams are required by the NBA to educate players, coaches and staff annually about what is allowed and not allowed when it comes to gambling. The Orlando Magic met recently about that very topic.</p><p>And then after the news Thursday, they met again.</p><p>"Yesterday was another reminder of what we have to do," Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said. "We had another conversation with the group. I think the more that is going on, the more we have to continue to talk to the group about what is happening."</p><p>The league has at least 14 relationships with sportsbooks, including FanDuel and DraftKings. Some teams have their own deals as well. Silver has often spoken of how legal betting can be monitored and how unusual patterns can be flagged immediately, part of the reason why the league believes the integrity of games can be protected.</p>
<p>But some coaches and players still believe more can be done.</p><p>"The league, the game and the business of the league has evolved. And so we just have to be aware of how things evolve in this business, right?" San Antonio coach Mitch Johnson said. "It's very important for us to continue to just be educated and mindful of everything that has to do with our business. ... I believe in Adam Silver and the league, that they will do whatever is necessary to continue to grow the game in the right way."</p><p>Another issue for players and coaches is how social media has given bettors ways to communicate with those inside the league. Those interactions, many have said, are not always friendly.</p><p>"The outside world, in my day, couldn't get to us. They literally couldn't get to us," Rivers said Friday. "And now they can, with ease."</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries endorsed Zohran Mamdani in the race for New York City mayor Friday, one day before <span class="link">polls open citywide for early voting</span>. </p><p>"I deeply respect the will of the primary voters and the young people who have been inspired to participate in the electoral process. Zohran Mamdani has relentlessly focused on addressing the affordability crisis and explicitly committed to being a Mayor for all New Yorkers, including those who do not support his candidacy," Jeffries' statement said. "In that spirit, I support him and the entire citywide Democratic ticket in the general election."</p><p>Jeffries' backing is the latest show of support for the <span class="link">Democratic assemblyman from Queens</span> and <span class="link">frontrunner in the polls</span>.</p><p>Mamdani had been seeking the powerful Brooklyn Democrat's endorsement since the two <span class="link">met over the summer</span>. </p><p>"This campaign has always been about bringing people together to improve the quality of life for every New Yorker. I welcome Leader Jeffries' support and look forward to delivering a city government, and building a Democratic Party, relentlessly committed to our affordability agenda — and to fighting Trump's authoritarianism. Our movement to turn the page on the politics of big money and small ideas grows stronger by the day," Mamdani said in a statement from his campaign. </p>
<p>Earlier Friday, when asked why he had not yet endorsed Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, and its potential impact on the Democratic party, Jeffries said, "I have not refused to endorse. I have refused to articulate my position, and I will momentarily at some point in advance of early voting."</p><p>Jeffries also endorsed Democrats Mark Levine and Jumaane Williams for city comptroller and public advocate, respectively.</p><p>"When Congressman Jeffries gives his endorsement, it means a great deal to the assemblyman's campaign right before early voting. So I never thought he was going to take the risk," political analyst J.C. Polanco said.</p><p>Republicans are already signaling they will likely make Jeffries' endorsement future campaign material.</p>
<p>"He is endorsing the most radically extreme candidate for mayor in the history of the United States of America," Republican Rep. Mike Lawler said.  </p><p>Mamdani's opponent, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, picked up <span class="link">a key endorsement</span> of his own Thursday from <span class="link">outgoing Mayor Eric Adams</span>. The mayor <span class="link">ended his reelection campaign last month</span> and has been an <span class="link">outspoken critic of Mamdani's policies</span>. </p><p>"Andrew and I are two kids from New York, and when you think about it, Andrew and his brother, and I have three of them, and brothers fight," Adams said Thursday. "But when families are attacked, brothers come together. They understand that you have to protect the family.  </p><p>Adams' endorsement came a day after the <span class="link">candidates faced off in their final debate</span> before Election Day. Cuomo was seen joining the mayor courtside at the New York Knicks' home opener after the debate. </p><h2>Mamdani ads nixed by the Knicks</h2><p>The Knicks, meanwhile, are trying to avoid the appearance of an endorsement.</p><p>The team sent Mamdani's campaign a cease-and-desist letter over an ad that depicted a modified version of team's logo that replaced the word "Knicks" with "Zohran."</p><p>"The Knicks want to make it clear that we do not endorse Mr. Mamdani for mayor, and we object to his use of our copyrighted logo," a Knicks spokesperson told CBS News in a statement, adding, "We will pursue all legal remedies to enforce our rights."</p>
<h2>Key endorsements in the NYC mayoral election, so far</h2><p>Mamdani previously earned two <span class="link">high-profile endorsements</span> from <span class="link">Sen. Bernie Sanders</span> and <span class="link">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</span> in the Democratic primary. He was also <span class="link">cross-endorsed by some of his fellow candidates</span> in <span class="link">ranked choice voting</span>. </p><p>Since his primary win, the state Assemblyman has also picked up endorsements from <span class="link">New York Gov. Kathy Hochul</span>, state <span class="link">Attorney General Letitia James</span>, state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, state <span class="link">Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie</span> and several other elected officials. </p><p>He is also being backed by the Working Families Party and the <span class="link">United Federation of Teachers</span>, which is the city's largest teachers union. </p><p>Cuomo, meanwhile, received an endorsement from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg <span class="link">during the primary</span>. Jim Walden also threw his support behind Cuomo when <span class="link">he left the race over the summer</span>, hoping to <span class="link">help defeat Mamdani</span>. The United Clergy Coalition is also supporting Cuomo.</p><p>Republican Curtis Sliwa is endorsed by Reps. Elise Stefanik and Mike Lawler, as well as former New York City <span class="link">Mayor Rudy Giuliani</span>.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Melissa is expected to strengthen from a tropical storm into a major hurricane this weekend, and it could bring "life-threatening and catastrophic" flash flooding and landslides to Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic early next week, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center warns.</p><p>Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major <span class="link">impacts on the mainland United States</span>.</p><h2>Melissa's forecast and path</h2><p>On Friday night, Melissa's core was about 180 miles southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 245 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, the hurricane center said. Maximum sustained winds were 65 mph, with tropical storm-force winds extending some 140 miles east from the storm's center. It was inching north at 3 mph.</p>
<p>It was forecast to become a hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane — meaning a <span class="link">Category 3</span> or higher — by Sunday. </p><p>"It's going to intensify very rapidly," CBS News weather anchor Lonnie Quinn said Friday evening.</p><p>Jamaica, Haiti and eastern Cuba should brace for "catastrophic rainfall, up to nearly 3 feet of rain," Quinn said. "Mountainous terrain — there's going to be mudslides. I am fearful for what we will find by the time we get into next week for this portion of the Caribbean."</p>
<p>On top of that, he warned, the storm could be packing 140 mile per hour winds.</p><p>"Jamaica, I think, is going to take the worst of it," Quinn said.</p><p>A hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica. A hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning were in effect for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti, from the border with the Dominican Republic to Port-au-Prince.</p>
<p>Although Melissa was moving north Friday, the hurricane center said it was forecast to take a turn to the west on Saturday and continue that westward movement through Monday.</p>
<p>"On the forecast track, the center of Melissa is expected to move near or over Jamaica early next week and could be near or over eastern Cuba by the middle of next week," the hurricane center said. </p><h2>Rainfall forecasts</h2><p>Melissa is expected to drop up to 25 inches of rain on parts of southern Haiti, the southern Dominican Republic and Jamaica through Tuesday, with higher amounts possible in some areas, the hurricane center said. Southeast Cuba could see up to 12 inches of rain. </p><p>"Potentially catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are possible across portions of Jamaica and the southern Dominican Republic, while catastrophic flash flooding is anticipated in southern Haiti," forecasters said. </p>
<p>Additional heavy rainfall is likely beyond Tuesday, the hurricane center said, but uncertainty remains about the more extended forecast.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Officers opened fire Thursday night at a vehicle backing into a line of Coast Guard and law enforcement personnel outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, site of a day-long protest against what was originally planned as an immigration enforcement surge in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>A CBS News Bay Area photographer at the scene captured video showing a U-Haul truck reversing toward the base entranceand law enforcement firing their weapons at the vehicle.</p><p>Photographer Rick Villaroman said the U-Haul had been parked outside the base for the better part of the day until it inexplicably began to reverse quickly toward officers blocking off the gate. </p><p>"He just hit the gas and sped towards them," Villaroman said. "And that's when they opened fire. About 20 to 30 rounds."</p><p>In a statement on social media overnight Friday Pacific time, the Coast Guard said, "At approximately 10:00 p.m. (PDT) on Thursday, Coast Guard security personnel standing watch on Coast Guard Island observed a vehicle driving erratically and attempting to back into Coast Guard Base Alameda. Coast Guard personnel issued multiple verbal commands to stop the vehicle, the driver failed to comply and proceeded to put the vehicle in reverse."</p>
<p>"When the vehicle's actions posed a direct threat to the safety of Coast Guard and security personnel, law enforcement officers discharged several rounds of live fire," the statement said. "No Coast Guard personnel were injured during the incident."</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security said Friday morning that the truck driver was wounded in the stomach and was being held for a mental health evaluation.</p><p>The FBI San Francisco Field Office said it was the lead investigating agency for the incident. </p><p>"At the request of the U.S. Coast Guard, the FBI responded to the scene and deployed its Evidence Response Team, Crisis Management Team, and Special Agent Bomb Technicians to assist in the investigation," the FBI San Francisco Field Office said in a statement to CBS News Bay Area. "Two individuals were injured in the incident, both sustaining non-life-threatening injuries. One of the individuals injured has been identified as a subject in the investigation. That subject has been released from the hospital and is currently in custody."</p>
<h2>Driver takes off after shooting, then returns</h2><p>The driver stopped backing up when the gunfire erupted and then drove away from the police line, stopping briefly before driving away and then returning to the scene shortly after.</p><p>"The driver of the U-Haul came back, parked it down this street here, and walked out and left," Villaroman said.</p><p>Villaroman said that before authorities arrived, he inspected the abandoned vehicle and saw multiple bullet holes but no blood in the cabin.</p><p>The protesters who were still at the base largely cleared out after the shooting, he said.</p>
<h2>Coast Guard base was to be Border Patrol staging area</h2><p>The base was to have been the staging area for a planned immigration enforcement surge by Border Patrol agents in the San Francisco Bay Area. President Trump later <span class="link">said the planned surge in San Francisco had been called off</span>, and on Friday, Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee said <span class="link">she confirmed that the operation had been canceled for the entire Bay Area</span>.</p><p>Protesters began gathering outside the base entrance early Thursday morning ahead of the anticipated immigration enforcement crackdown in San Francisco, with some demonstrators attempting to block vehicles going through the gates. The gathering turned into a day-long standoff between California Highway Patrol officers and protesters who were later joined by 100 to 200 more demonstrators who marched from a rally in Oakland's Fruitvale District to the base, also known as Coast Guard Island, an artificial island in the Oakland Estuary between Oakland and Alameda.</p><p>The CHP said in a press release that the shooting at the base happened once the protest action had calmed down and its officers had left the base for the evening. Other CHP officers located the abandoned suspect vehicle nearby following the shooting, the CHP said. </p>
<p>The agency added that CHP Commissioner Sean Duryee met with Coast Guard leadership on Friday to coordinate efforts to ensure the safety of Coast Guard personnel and the public exercising their First Amendment right.</p><p><span class="link">U.S. officials told CBS News</span> on Wednesday that the Trump administration had planned to expand its nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration to the Bay Area and that Border Patrol agents would stage at the base, located roughly 15 miles from San Francisco.</p><p>"DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens - including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists - in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco," a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said. "As it does every day, DHS law enforcement will enforce the laws of our nation."</p><p>Mr. Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that the enforcement action in San Francisco was canceled following a conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie and calls from tech leaders, citing the city's progress in addressing crime. </p><p>Despite the announcement, protesters remained outside the entrance to the base Thursday afternoon. Additional protests and rallies were held in San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose.</p><h2>Smoke grenades, flash bang devices deployed at protest</h2><p>Protesters began to arrive at Coast Guard Island around 6 a.m. Thursday, blocking the entrance to the island. Shortly after 7 a.m., a CBS News Bay Area crew spotted a Coast Guard vehicle drive past the crowd and then fire flash bangs and smoke grenades to disperse it.  </p>
<p>At least two people were seen being detained at the site.</p>
<p>One demonstrator appeared to have been hit by a piece of shrapnel or a projectile — a minister who was part of a group of interfaith leaders taking part.</p><p>The minister, identified as Jorge Bautista, spoke to reporters after the incident.</p><p>"I obviously was shot with whatever that Border Patrol had," said Bautista, who is a pastor at an Oakland church. "And I came to say we came in peace, and he didn't care. There's nothing else to say — he wanted to cause harm to me."</p><p>"It's clear that we're here to be on the side of love," Bautista added. "Because it is our responsibility to express love and be on the side of peace and to make sure that no families are being harassed and threatened with their lives."</p><p>"They stopped at the crowd, and then got out and said they were going to drive through us if we didn't move, they weren't going to stop once they started, and they started pushing through," said one Alameda resident who didn't to give her name. "They ran over one gentleman's foot, another person got pushed off." </p><p>"They have the right to come out here and walk around, (and) so do I," said one man wearing a MAGA hat who also didn't share his name.</p><p>"We are not here to be violent, but if we are being aggressed, what do you do?" remarked Oakland resident Kendra Ferguson.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump admin. aims to auction offshore oil leases despite states' opposition</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Trump administration is proposing to auction offshore oil drilling leases across new portions of the U.S. coast as soon as 2026, according to internal Department of Interior draft documents viewed by CBS News.</p><p>New leases would include waters off New England, the Carolinas and California.  </p><p>Offshore oil leases are common along the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana, as well as parts of Alaska, but there are currently no active oil leases on the Atlantic coast, and California has not had a new oil lease since 1984. </p><p>This comes as the Department of Interior formally announced plans this week to reopen 1.56 million aces in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas leasing, reversing a Biden administration decision to <span class="link">limit oil drilling in the Arctic</span>. </p><p>That decision drew a strong rebuke from Democrats, including Sen. Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, who accused the administration of rewarding the fossil fuel industry for its support of the president. "This decision is not about energy dominance—it's about donor dominance," Markey said in a statement. "The Trump administration must immediately reverse its shortsighted decision. The Arctic Refuge is not for sale." </p>
<p>The Department of Interior is assessing new oil leases as part of the National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program, which issues oil leases in five-year increments. The Biden administration set the previous plan and had the fewest leases on record, with only three.  </p>
<p>Documents reviewed by CBS News included assessments of whether state governments favored offshore drilling, and indicated that the states opposed it. The documents also included potential dates for leasing each tract of seafloor.  </p><p>If the plan is approved by the Interior secretary and moves forward, California could see lease sales as soon as 2027 and the Beaufort Sea in Alaska, which includes the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, could see lease sales as early as 2026. Under the terms of the lease, a company would then have five to 10 years, depending on the water depth in the area, to explore and develop oil and gas production. </p><p>The Trump administration opened a public comment period in April for a new five-year gas leasing policy. Lawmakers from both parties voiced concerns about offshore drilling, including members of Congress and state governors, and the process drew more than 34,000 comments. </p>
<p>Governors Josh Stein (D, North Carolina) and Henry McMaster (R, South Carolina), issued a joint statement opposing the idea, saying there has been broad bipartisan consensus against offshore drilling because of, "the risks that these activities pose to the economy and environment of our states." </p><p>In a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in June, McMaster wrote, "Every coastal municipality in South Carolina has passed a resolution opposing oil and gas exploration activities offshore. I stand firmly with them. We simply cannot afford to accept the risk of the adverse environmental impact attendant to offshore drilling."  </p><p>CBS News reached out to McMaster for comment, but his office did not respond.</p><p>Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican who is running for governor of South Carolina, issued a similar letter to Burgum, writing, "In South Carolina, there is widespread bipartisan agreement in opposing offshore drilling off the coast of our state." </p><p>The Trump administration tried to open new offshore oil leases during his first term, but backtracked when Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina lawmakers from both parties criticized the effort. The Trump administration instituted bans on offshore drilling in waters surrounding those states shortly before the 2020 election. The current iteration of the plan does not include offshore oil leases off Florida's coast, but it is unclear whether those bans will continue off the Carolinas.  </p><p>CBS News reached out to the White House and Department of Interior for more information about the plans. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on ongoing policy discussions. </p><p>The Biden administration issued a record low number of offshore oil leases, and <span class="link">withdrew 625 million acres</span> along the Pacific, Atlantic and Alaska coasts from offshore oil development. The Trump administration rescinded those Biden withdrawals, and a federal court in Louisiana ruled this month that the Biden withdrawals were illegal.  </p>
<p>Offshore oil leases have been unpopular for decades. Congress had a moratorium preventing drilling on both coasts and the eastern Gulf from 1981 to 2008, and President George H.W. Bush issued an executive order preventing offshore drilling which stood until 2008, when his son <span class="link">lifted the order</span>.  </p><p>The Obama administration had once considered opening the Atlantic coast to offshore oil leases but changed its stance following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf. </p><p>The Department of Interior is expected to publish its first proposal on the subject in the coming weeks. There will be two additional comment periods before a final plan is proposed and implemented. </p>

<div class="article-title">Letitia James blasts prosecutor in criminal case for conversation with journalist</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Attorneys for New York Attorney General Letitia James took aim at the Trump-appointed prosecutor overseeing her bank fraud case Thursday, accusing interim U.S. attorney Lindsey Halligan of an improper conversation with a journalist and vowing to seek dismissal of the indictment on the grounds that <span class="link">Halligan</span> was unlawfully named to the job.</p><p>The pair of legal filings came the evening before James is set to be arraigned Friday in federal court in Norfolk, Virginia, on <span class="link">charges</span> of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. Prosecutors allege that James bought a house in Virginia and agreed to use it as a second home, but ultimately rented it out and used it as an investment property.</p><p>James has denied all wrongdoing and accused the Justice Department of political retribution, after James sued President Trump in civil court and <span class="link">secured a nine-figure fraud judgment</span>. The fine <span class="link">was later erased</span> entirely by an appeals court.</p><h2>James to challenge Halligan's appointment</h2><p>In a two-page legal filing, James's lawyers alerted the court that they will file a motion Friday "to dismiss the indictment that challenges the unlawful appointment of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan."</p><p>The filing did not lay out the argument her lawyers plan to offer.</p>
<p>Lawyers for former FBI Director James Comey also challenged Halligan's appointment earlier this week, <span class="link">arguing the charges against him</span> for allegedly lying to Congress should be tossed out on the grounds that she was "defectively appointed to her office."</p><p>Halligan was appointed after the previous interim U.S. attorney, Erik Siebert, resigned after almost eight months on the job. The role is usually subject to a 120-day limit, but in Siebert's case, the judges in the Eastern District of Virginia voted to extend his term after the 120-day period elapsed. Comey's lawyers argue the 120-day clock began when Siebert started in January, making Halligan's appointment invalid.</p><p>Several other temporary U.S. attorneys have faced similar challenges to their eligibility in recent months, including the top federal prosecutors in <span class="link">New Jersey</span> and <span class="link">Nevada</span>.</p><h2>James alleges Halligan broke Justice Department rules by speaking with reporter</h2><p>James also asked a judge Thursday to prohibit the Justice Department from disclosing case materials and investigative information to the media, in a court filing that criticized Halligan for texting a journalist last weekend to criticize coverage of the case.</p>
<p>Anna Bower, a senior editor at Lawfare, wrote earlier this week that Halligan sent her unsolicited messages on the encrypted app Signal that criticized her for sharing a New York Times article about the James case on social media. Bower says Halligan accused her of "jumping to conclusions" and sharing "biased" information that was "way off."</p><p>"You're biased. Your reporting isn't accurate. I'm the one handling the case and I'm telling you that," one message from Halligan read, according to Bower.</p><p>In Thursday's filing, James's lawyers called Halligan's messages to Bower "unusual and improper," and "a stunning disclosure of internal government information."</p><p>They argued the conversation violated court rules and internal Justice Department policies that bar the sharing of grand jury information and restrict prosecutors' out-of-court statements. By casting doubt on the accuracy of the Times article, James' lawyers said, Halligan was "commenting on the evidence in the case and that which she likely learned as a result of grand jury testimony."</p><p>This disclosure could undermine James's right to a fair trial, her lawyers claimed.</p><p>"It has been reported that Ms. Halligan has no prosecutorial experience whatsoever," the filing read. "But all federal prosecutors are required to know and follow the rules governing their conduct from their first day on the job, and so any lack of experience cannot excuse their violation."</p><p>A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment to CBS News.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has faced similar pressure in other cases. </p><p>Last month, attorneys for accused UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione asked a judge to bar <span class="link">federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty</span>, accusing federal and New York authorities of violating his rights. They pointed to statements by Attorney General Pam Bondi calling the killing a "premeditated, cold-blooded assassination," and criticized a late 2024 perp walk staged by federal and local authorities that looked like a "scene out of a Marvel movie."</p>

<div class="article-title">Nearly 8,000 Venezuelan nationals returned on ICE deportation flights since March</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Trump administration has conducted 40 removal flights to the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, deporting nearly 8,000 Venezuelan nationals since March, according to senior Department of Homeland Security officials who spoke to CBS News on the condition of anonymity. </p><p>The flights began after Venezuela agreed in March to resume repatriation flights, and have continued amid heightened U.S.-Venezuelan tensions in recent weeks.</p><p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported approximately 140 individuals back to Venezuela in its latest removal flight on October 15. Last Wednesday's flight included at least seven individuals with criminal histories, including alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang and sexual predators, according to DHS. </p><p>Among those deported include Jefferson Bracho Haddad, an alleged Tren de Aragua gang member that a DHS spokesperson tells CBS News had six criminal arrests, including for larceny and drug possession. The agency spokesperson added that the flight also returned Angelo Dennis-Jesus Ainaga-Jaspe, convicted of multiple weapons offenses, plus Diego Alejandro Mavarez Arocha, convicted of sexual assault.</p><p>DHS has repeatedly spotlighted removals of individuals with criminal histories as part of an ongoing effort by the Trump administration to deport undocumented migrants the government determines pose threats to public safety.</p>
<p>"These individuals, including confirmed Tren de Aragua gang members, sexual predators, and violent offenders, should have never been in our country in the first place," said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement provided to CBS News, adding that an estimated 2 million undocumented immigrants have left the U.S. since January. </p><p>McLaughlin did not specify how many of those individuals were believed to have departed the U.S. voluntarily, versus those who have been deported. The vast majority would have needed to leave without making contact with DHS to reach that total. According to <span class="link">internal government figures previously obtained by CBS News</span>, over the first six months of President Trump's second term, the administration deported nearly 150,000 people and recorded 13,000 who self-deported.</p><p>According to senior DHS officials, the deportations to Venezuela have occurred alongside the intensified U.S. campaign against drug trafficking and transnational crime in South America. The Trump administration has carried out at least 10 known strikes on suspected narcotics vessels over the past two months, including two this week off Colombia's Pacific coast. The most recent strike, <span class="link">conducted overnight, targeted a vessel allegedly operated by Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang in the Caribbean Sea</span>. </p><p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said it was "a lethal kinetic strike" in international waters, marking the first night strike of the campaign. "Six male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the strike … all six terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed," Hegseth said.</p>
<p>Trump administration officials say the combination of targeted strikes and deportation flights reflect a multi-pronged strategy to disrupt the Tren de Aragua gang and other organized criminal networks, which have been linked to drug trafficking and violent crime throughout the Americas. </p><p>The U.S.-Venezuela repatriation deal, which allows the flights to Caracas, has faced scrutiny from human rights organizations, though Trump administration officials point to the diplomatic deal as an important tool in reducing the influence of transnational criminal gangs within the United States.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. military is <span class="link">sending an aircraft carrier strike group</span> to the waters off Latin America, part of a buildup of U.S. forces in the region.</p><p>The military maneuvers have drawn the Venezuelan government's ire. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro <span class="link">ordered new military exercises</span> last week, and he said he's <span class="link">prepared to declare a state of emergency</span> earlier this month, accusing the U.S. of "aggression."</p>

<p><em>Buffalo, New York</em> — When Brianna Lanoye and her fiancé Zach Klapp started planning their wedding, they had a hard time whittling down the guest list, Lanoye especially. </p><p>She is the principal of the Buffalo Academy of Science, a K-12 charter school in Buffalo, New York, and she kept telling people she wanted to invite the whole school.</p><p>"I definitely mentioned it multiple times," Lanoye told CBS News. </p><p>This wasn't just lip service. She really did want them there. But since that would be impractical, the staff and students got together, in secret, to create the next best thing.</p><p>Earlier this month, just a few days before her actual wedding, the staff dressed Lanoye in a makeshift wedding dress and led her into the school courtyard.</p>
<p>"When I exited the building and saw all the students gathered there, I was blown away," Lanoye said. </p><p>The couple in white stood before more than 400 students and staff. The students saw Lanoye and Klapp exchange vows and candy ring pops. And a student officiated the proceedings. </p><p>No one in the audience objected to the union, but a few of the students joked with CBS News that  </p><p>Klapp is not Lanoye's one, true love.</p>
<p> "She couldn't stop smiling…She loves the kids more than her husband," student Sabahat Uddin said. </p><p>When CBS News asked Lanoye to confirm or deny the allegations, she just laughed and said the ceremony was everything she could have wanted. </p><p>"I love my students more than anything," Lanoye said. "And I just hope that our students feel as loved as I felt in that moment."</p>

<div class="article-title">CPI report shows inflation continued to climb in September</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Consumer Price Index climbed at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in below economists' forecasts as the impact of President Trump's tariffs remain muted.</p><h2>By the numbers</h2><p>Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet had forecast CPI rose at a 3.1% annual clip last month. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.</p><p>While most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the government shutdown, the Department of Labor is making an exception for the September CPI data. That's because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.</p><p>The September CPI report could be the last inflation data economists see for a while. The Labor Department is unlikely to release inflation figures next month because of difficulty collecting data during the shutdown, the Trump administration said Friday in an email. </p> <h2>What economists say</h2><p>Inflation is inching higher partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, <span class="link">according to economists</span>. U.S. businesses are eating some of the costs in the form of lower profits, which has blunted the impact of the import duties on consumers. </p>
<p>Still, companies are also passing on <span class="link">as much as 55%</span> of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis. Other research shows a <span class="link">lower rate of passthrough</span> tariff costs to shoppers. </p><p>"Tariffs have put upward pressure on prices, particularly in the goods-producing sector of the economy," Brandon Zureick, senior managing director and chief economist at investment firm Johnson Investment Counsel, told CBS News. "We're definitely a little higher than where we started the year, and above the Fed's target" of 2% annual inflation. </p><p>Mr. Trump has <span class="link">pointed to tariffs</span> as a tool for protecting U.S. manufacturing, as well as to convince businesses to reshore their factories within the country, and for generating billions of new federal revenue. </p><p>Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and set the Federal Reserve on a path of hiking interest rates. Higher borrowing costs can temper inflation because it makes loans and credit cards more expensive, which can cause consumers and businesses to pare spending.</p>
<h2>What does the CPI mean for interest rates?</h2><p>The recent rise in inflation is complicating the Fed's decision on interest rates, with the central bank scheduled to make its next rate decision on Oct. 29. But today's inflation data could provide additional support for another cut, analysts said Friday.</p><p>"There was little in today's benign CPI report to 'spook' the Fed and we continue to expect further easing at next week's Fed meeting," Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a Friday email. "A December rate cut also remains likely with the current data drought providing the Fed with little reason to deviate from the path set out in the dot plot."</p><p>Still, inflation is edging higher, which could be an argument for keeping rates steady. But at the same time, the job market is experiencing a <span class="link">sharp slowdown in hiring</span>, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited last month when the central bank made its <span class="link">first rate cut of 2025</span>. Lower borrowing costs can help support the job market by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow, encouraging them to expand and hire. </p><p>That means the combination of rising inflation and weakening job growt is putting the Fed's dual mandate — to keep both inflation and unemployment low — in conflict. Powell said earlier this month that the <span class="link">risks posed by the labor market</span> may be outweighing concerns about rising inflation.</p><p>"The Fed has recognized the trends in the labor market as changing their directives," Zureick said. "We've been dangerously close to a zero level of job growth for a few months."</p><p>Given the Fed's focus on the labor market risks, the higher CPI rate isn't likely to derail expectations for a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's next meeting later this month, economists say. </p><p>The probability of a 0.25-percentage point cut at the Fed's Oct. 29 meeting is pegged at 98.9%, according to CME FedWatch.</p>

<div class="article-title">Ontario will pull anti-tariff ads after Trump vows to cut off trade talks with Canada</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington</em><strong> — </strong>The government of Ontario will pause an anti-tariff ad campaign aimed at the U.S., the Canadian province's leader announced Friday, less than a day after President Trump vowed to end trade negotiations with Canada over an ad that uses late President Ronald Reagan's voice.</p><p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the ad campaign will be put on hold starting Monday "so that trade talks can resume." He said he's told his team to "keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games."</p><p>The move came after Mr. Trump torched the ad on Truth Social late Friday, and wrote: "Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED."</p><p>The ad in question includes excerpts from a 1987 radio address given by Reagan, in which the former president said tariffs work "only for a short time" and "hurt every American worker and consumer." </p><p>"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars," Reagan said, as quoted by the ad.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement on Friday<strong>, </strong>prior to Ford's decision to pull the ad next week, that the Trump administration "has repeatedly sought to address Canada's longstanding, unfair trade barriers."</p><p>"These good-faith efforts with Canadian officials have not led to any constructive progress," Desai said. "Ontario's taxpayer-funded ad campaign on American TV networks — that misleadingly edited President Reagan's 1987 radio address about trade — is the latest example of how Canadian officials would rather play games than engage with the administration. As President Trump made clear on Truth Social, further talks are a futile effort if Canada can't be serious."</p><p>Ford wrote on X Friday: "Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses. We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels."</p><p>CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment on Ford's decision.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters in response to the breakdown in talks Friday, "we can't control the trade policy of the United States," but his government has sought to make progress on trade negotiations.</p><p>"We stand ready to pick up on that progress and build on that progress when the Americans are ready to have those discussions," he said.</p><p>Earlier Thursday, the Ronald Reagan Foundation said in a statement that the ad used "selective audio" and "misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address." The foundation also said the government of Ontario didn't seek permission to use snippets from Reagan's address, and said it is "reviewing its legal options in this matter."</p><p>Mr. Trump pointed to the Ronald Reagan Foundation's statement in his Truth Social post, calling Ontario's ad "FAKE" and claiming it "only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court" — referring to <span class="link">a pending case</span> on the legality of Mr. Trump's tariff strategy.</p><p>Canada is the second-largest trading partner for the U.S. after Mexico, with the U.S. importing $412.7 billion worth of Canadian goods last year, and Canada buying $349.4 billion in American goods, according to U.S. statistics.</p><p>But relations between the U.S. and its northern neighbor <span class="link">have frayed amid Mr. Trump's trade strategy</span>. He initially imposed higher tariffs on Canada earlier this year, accusing the country of not doing enough to stem the flow of illicit drugs and migration across the border — allegations that Canadian officials pushed back on.</p><p>Over the summer, Mr. Trump <span class="link">hiked tariffs on the country</span> to 35%, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>Back in March, Canada imposed 25% retaliatory tariffs on many U.S. products not covered by the USMCA. But in August, as part of efforts to reach a deal on tariffs, Carney <span class="link">said those retaliatory tariffs were being lifted</span>. The two nations have yet to reach such a deal.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Carney said earlier this week the country would seek to double its exports to countries other than the U.S., citing the "pall of uncertainty" caused by American tariffs.</p><p>Still, Carney has sought to negotiate with Mr. Trump, visiting the White House earlier this month.</p>

<div class="article-title">U.S. sending aircraft carrier strike group to Latin America in major buildup</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington </em>— The Pentagon said Friday that the U.S. is sending an aircraft carrier strike group to the waters off Latin America, an escalation that will dramatically increase the number of service members and ships dedicated to the Trump administration's <span class="link">campaign</span> to counter narcotics traffickers.</p><p>Sean Parnell, a Pentagon spokesman, said on X that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth "has directed the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group and embarked carrier air wing to the U.S. Southern Command" area of responsibility. Southern Command is responsible for the Caribbean Sea, Central and South America and the surrounding waters.</p><p>Parnell said the "enhanced U.S. force presence" will "bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States homeland and our security in the Western Hemisphere."</p><p>The USS Gerald R. Ford is the Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, having been commissioned into service in 2017. At more than 1,100 ft. long with a displacement of 100,000 long tons, the carrier is the largest in the world. It's powered by two nuclear reactors and can reach a top speed of 34.5 mph, according to the Navy.</p><p>The carrier group will join eight U.S. vessels that are already in the region, including three destroyers, one cruiser, a littoral combat ship, an amphibious assault ship and two transport ships.</p>
<p>The Ford is currently in the Mediterranean Sea, a defense official told CBS News, along with three destroyers.</p>
<p>News of the decision to send the carrier group to Latin America comes after the U.S. launched another strike on a vessel allegedly operated by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua that Hegseth said was trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea.</p><p>The secretary said on X that the strike killed all six men who were on board, and took place in international waters. He said it was the first strike to take place at night.</p><p>"The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics," he wrote. Hegseth posted a video, marked unclassified, showing the vessel as it was hit.</p>
<p>This latest strike appears to be the 10th carried out by the Trump administration against alleged drug trafficking boats over the past several weeks, which have now led to more than 40 deaths. The first several took place in the Caribbean Sea, but this week, the administration's campaign broadened into the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<div class="article-title">Where is debris from the White House East Wing demolition being taken?</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A red and gray scrap hauler pulled out of the White House gates Friday morning, filled with remnants of the <span class="link">felled East Wing</span>. Mangled rebar sprouted above the truck bed's rim. </p><p>The truck trundled through the streets of Washington, D.C., down Pennsylvania Avenue, past an exit for Nationals Park and then north along the Anacostia River. Uneven pavement jostled free bits of White House rubble in its wake. </p>
<p>This week, demolition crews <span class="link">finished</span> razing the East Wing and corridor that connected it to the White House residence. An upgraded walkway and 90,000-square foot <span class="link">ballroom</span> will eventually take their place. </p><p>Construction began last month with heavy equipment cycling in and out of the White House's east and south grounds. </p><p>For decades, the East Wing housed White House offices, workspace for First Ladies and served as a formal entrance for White House guests attending State Dinners or Christmas parties. </p>
<p>It was built in 1902, during the Theodore Roosevelt administration and completed in the 1940s.</p>
<p>Jacqueline Kennedy gave CBS News a tour of the White House complex in 1962. "I think this house will always grow and should," Kennedy told CBS News correspondent Charles Collingwood. She described making changes to the furnishings as a slow process that required expert input and advisory board approvals — to preserve history.</p>
<p>President Trump's privately funded construction project appears to be sailing ahead with less scrutiny.</p><p>The White House said historical components of the East Wing — like former First Lady Rosalynn Carter's original office — have been saved and are likely to get a new home. </p>
<p>But Kennedy's garden was removed amid the demolition, sources said. </p>
<p>Some dirt from the grounds has been taken to Hains Point parkland that sits on the Potomac River, just across from Ronald Reagan National Airport. The White House said some of construction debris, like wood and plants, may be sent to nurseries, through the National Park Service.</p>
<p>The red and gray truck carrying bits of the East Wing crossed from D.C. into Maryland and exited the highway. It entered Smith Industries, a vast scrap yard that sits next to railroad tracks. </p>
<p>Trucks carrying discarded siding, crushed cars and rusted appliances buzzed around the lot. Hard-hatted workers on forklifts zigzagged among the trucks. </p><p>Hydraulic claws hoisted heaps of twisted refuse into one machine. Another ran at full whir, spitting out bite-sized pieces that could be sold and eventually recycled. </p><p>The truck pulled onto the scale, headed toward the debris field and disappeared from view.</p><p>About 40 minutes later, after dropping off its load and a bit of history, the truck drove away from the yard. </p>

<div class="article-title">Blue Jays rout Dodgers 11-4 in World Series opener</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>TORONTO — Addison Barger launched the first pinch-hit grand slam in World Series history, Alejandro Kirk added a two-run homer in a nine-run sixth inning and the Toronto Blue Jays overwhelmed the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers 11-4 in the opener Friday night.</p>
<p>"That's the epitome of our offense," said Blue Jays third baseman Ernie Clement, who laced a tiebreaking single in the sixth. "It's a collective effort and everybody just doing their job."</p> <p>Daulton Varsho started Toronto's comeback from a 2-0 deficit with a two-run drive in the fourth off two-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell.</p> <p>"I've faced him before plenty of times. He's obviously dominated me," Varsho said. "It's one of those guys where you've got to get your best swing off and whatever happens, happens."</p>
<p>The longball barrage was fitting as the Fall Classic returned to Toronto for the first time since 1993, when Joe Carter hit the second walk-off homer to end a World Series. And in an unusual tie to that night 32 years ago, Varsho is named after Darren Daulton, the Philadelphia Phillies catcher Mitch Williams was throwing to when Carter connected.</p> <p>Shohei Ohtani hit his first Series home run for the heavily favored Dodgers, seeking to become the first repeat champion since the New York Yankees took three titles in a row from 1998-2000. Los Angeles was trailing by nine when he went deep off Braydon Fisher for a two-run shot in the seventh, his fourth homer in two games.</p> <p>Fans angry that Ohtani spurned the Blue Jays to sign a $700 million contract with the Dodgers in December 2023 chanted: "We don't need you!" when he came to the plate in the ninth.</p> <p>"Don't poke the bear," Toronto pitcher Chris Bassitt said.</p> <p>Game 2 in the best-of-seven series is at Rogers Centre on Saturday night.</p> <p>"They bring it every night," Clement said, referring to Blue Jays fans. "The last few months, honestly, they've been selling this place out and giving us a ton of energy. We're lucky to have these fans."</p>
<p>Playing after a one-week layoff following its National League Championship Series sweep, Los Angeles took a 2-0 lead against 22-year-old rookie Trey Yesavage on RBI singles by Kiké Hernández in the second and Will Smith in the third.</p> <p>Yesavage made his fourth postseason start — one more than his regular-season career total. At 22 years, 88 days old he became the second-youngest pitcher to start a World Series opener behind Brooklyn's Ralph Branca at 21 years, 267 days in 1947 at Yankee Stadium.</p> <p>Yesavage made some key pitches during his four innings, leaving the bases loaded in the second by retiring Ohtani on a groundout and stranding a runner at third the next inning when he struck out Max Muncy.</p> <p>Seranthony Domínguez got the win with 1 1/3 hitless innings.</p> <p>Varsho's homer was the first off Snell by a left-handed hitter since Juan Soto connected for the Yankees on June 2 last year. Snell gave up a career-high five hits on changeups and allowed five runs, eight hits and three walks in five-plus innings.</p> <p>"Blake just didn't have good fastball command," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "There were just a couple bad walks in there."</p> <p>Snell pitched in the Series for the first time since 2020 with Tampa Bay, when he was removed in the sixth inning of Game 6 while pitching a shutout against the Dodgers. Los Angeles rallied against the Rays' bullpen for its first championship since 1988.</p> <p>Now the Dodgers are chasing their third title in six years.</p> <p>Coming off a seven-game ALCS against Seattle that ended Monday, Toronto got 14 hits and key contributions from Bo Bichette and Varsho, who combined with Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to become the first trio of sons of former major leaguers to start for one team in a Series game.</p> <p>Returning from a sprained left knee that had sidelined him since Sept. 6, Bichette played second base for the first time in six years and favored the knee. He singled in the first, ranged to the left side of the infield to field a grounder and save a run, then with the score 2-2 drew a full-count walk from Snell starting the sixth.</p>
<p>Twelve batters went to the plate in the inning. Clement singled off reliever Emmet Sheehan for a 3-2 lead, pinch-hitter Nathan Lukes drew a bases-loaded walk and Andrés Giménez added an RBI single.</p> <p>Barger greeted left-hander Anthony Banda with a 413-foot drive to right-center on a hanging slider to put Toronto ahead 9-2.</p> <p>"Just a blackout moment. Just crazy," Barger said. "I was choking up a little bit, just trying to put the ball in the air and get a run in."</p> <p>Kirk, who singled off the right-field wall a pitch before Varsho's homer, added his fourth home run of the postseason.</p> <p>"We just didn't make pitches when we need to to keep that game close," Roberts said. "We need to be better."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Up next</h3> <p>Dodgers RHP Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Blue Jays RHP Kevin Gausman start Saturday night. Yamamoto won Game 2 of the Series last year, allowing one run and one hit over 6 1/3 innings in a 4-2 victory over the Yankees and is coming off the first postseason complete game in eight years, a three-hitter against the Milwaukee Brewers. Gausman will be making his Series debut.</p>

<div class="article-title">U.S. sends aircraft carrier to South America in major escalation of military firepower</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. military is sending an aircraft carrier to the waters off South America, the Pentagon announced Friday, in the latest escalation of military firepower in a region where the Trump administration has unleashed more rapid strikes in recent days against boats it accuses of carrying drugs.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford and its strike group to deploy to the U.S. Southern Command region to "bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States," Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said on social media.</p> <p>The USS Ford, which has five destroyers in its strike group, is now deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. One of its destroyers is in the Arabian Sea and another is in the Red Sea, a person familiar with the operation told The Associated Press. As of Friday, the aircraft carrier was in port in Croatia on the Adriatic Sea.</p>
<p>The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations, would not say how long it would take for the strike group to arrive in the waters off South America or if all five destroyers would make the journey.</p> <p>Deploying an aircraft carrier will surge major additional resources to a region that has already seen an unusually large U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and the waters off Venezuela. </p>
<p>The latest deployment and the quickening pace of the U.S. strikes, including one Friday, raised new speculation about how far the Trump administration may go in operations it says are targeted at drug trafficking, including whether it could try to topple Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. He faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Moving thousands more troops into the region</h3> <p>There are already more than 6,000 sailors and Marines on eight warships in the region. If the entire USS Ford strike group arrives, that could bring nearly 4,500 more sailors as well as the nine squadrons of aircraft assigned to the carrier.</p> <p>Complicating the situation is Tropical Storm Melissa, which has been nearly stationary in the central Caribbean with forecasters warning it could soon strengthen into a powerful hurricane.</p>
<p>Hours before Parnell announced the news, Hegseth said the military had conducted the 10th strike on a suspected drug-running boat, leaving six people dead and bringing the death count for the attacks that began in early September to at least 43 people.</p> <p>Hegseth said on social media that the vessel struck overnight was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. It was the second time the Trump administration has tied one of its operations to the gang that originated in a Venezuelan prison.</p>
<p>"If you are a narco-terrorist smuggling drugs in our hemisphere, we will treat you like we treat Al-Qaeda," Hegseth said in his post. "Day or NIGHT, we will map your networks, track your people, hunt you down, and kill you."</p> <p>The strikes have ramped up from one every few weeks when they first began last month to three this week, killing a total of at least 43 people. Two of the most recent strikes were carried out in the eastern Pacific Ocean, expanding the area where the military has launched attacks and shifting to where much of the cocaine is smuggled from the world's largest producers, including Colombia.</p> <p>Escalating tensions with Colombia, the Trump administration imposed sanctions Friday on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade.</p> <h3 class="edTag">U.S. focus on Venezuela and Tren de Aragua</h3> <p>Friday's strike drew parallels to the first announced by the U.S. last month by focusing on Tren de Aragua, which the Trump administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization and blamed for being at the root of the violence and drug dealing that plague some cities.</p> <p>While not mentioning the origin of the latest boat, the Republican administration says at least four of the boats it has hit have come from Venezuela. On Thursday, the U.S. military flew a pair of supersonic heavy bombers up to the coast of Venezuela.</p>
<p>Maduro argues that the U.S. operations are the latest effort to force him out of office.</p> <p>Maduro on Thursday praised security forces and a civilian militia for defense exercises along about 1,200 miles of coastline to prepare for the possibility of a U.S. attack.</p> <p>In the span of six hours, "100% of all the country's coastline was covered in real time, with all the equipment and heavy weapons to defend all of Venezuela's coasts if necessary," Maduro said during a government event shown on state television.</p>
<p>The U.S. military's presence is less about drugs than sending a message to countries in the region to align with U.S. interests, according to Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group's senior analyst for the Andes region.</p> <p>"An expression that I'm hearing a lot is 'Drugs are the excuse.' And everyone knows that," Dickinson said. "And I think that message is very clear in regional capitals. So the messaging here is that the U.S. is intent on pursuing specific objectives. And it will use military force against leaders and countries that don't fall in line."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Comparing the drug crackdown to the war on terror</h3> <p>Hegseth's remarks around the strikes have recently begun to draw a direct comparison between the war on terrorism that the U.S. declared after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the Trump administration's crackdown on drug traffickers.</p> <p>President Trump this month declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants and said the U.S. was in an "armed conflict" with them, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration after 9/11.</p> <p>When reporters asked Trump on Thursday whether he would request that Congress issue a declaration of war against the cartels, he said that wasn't the plan.</p> <p>"I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK? We're going to kill them, you know? They're going to be like, dead," Trump said during a roundtable at the White House.</p> <p>Lawmakers from both major political parties have expressed concerns about Trump ordering the military actions without receiving authorization from Congress or providing many details.</p> <p>"I've never seen anything quite like this before," said Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., who previously worked in the Pentagon and the State Department, including as an adviser in Afghanistan.</p> <p>"We have no idea how far this is going, how this could potentially bring in, you know, is it going to be boots on the ground? Is it going to be escalatory in a way where we could see us get bogged down for a long time?" he said.</p>
<p>Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, who has long been involved in foreign affairs in the hemisphere, said of Trump's approach: "It's about time."</p> <p>While Trump "obviously hates war," he also is not afraid to use the U.S. military in targeted operations, Diaz-Balart said. "I would not want to be in the shoes of any of these narco-cartels."</p>

<div class="article-title">DOJ hires immigration judges after months of layoffs</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The Justice Department has hired 36 immigration judges, including 25 temporary ones, for its Executive Office for Immigration Review, marking the first class to join the immigration courts after months of cuts to the workforce.</p> <p>Judges will soon take the bench across 16 states, according to a Justice Department announcement. These include courts that saw the biggest losses of judges this year such as Chelmsford, Mass., and Chicago.</p> <p>"EOIR is restoring its integrity as a preeminent administrative adjudicatory agency," the announcement states. "These new immigration judges are joining an immigration judge corps that is committed to upholding the rule of law."</p>
<p>The incoming class of permanent judges comprises mostly those with a background in federal government work, including EOIR itself and the Department of Homeland Security. Previously, they trained Immigration and Customs enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents, were asylum officers and worked for ICE's legal arm. One judge was originally going to take the bench at the start of the year but was among the initial class of judges fired before they could start.</p>
<p>The temporary immigration judges include military lawyers from the Marines, Navy, Army and Air Force. Earlier this summer, the Pentagon authorized about 600 military lawyers to work for the DOJ. The DOJ changed who could qualify as a temporary immigration judge — effectively lowering the requirements and removing the need to have prior immigration law experience.</p> <p>Immigration judges are the only ones who can revoke someone's green card or issue a final order of removal for people who have been in the country for more than two years and are in the process of being deported. Their backgrounds have often varied. Some come to the position after several years working for ICE's legal branch. Others come to it after working for immigrant defense nonprofits or private practice. Some have no immigration law experience.</p>
<p>The new cohort was trained at the EOIR headquarters in Virginia this month and are expected to start hearing immigration cases soon. Immigration courts have continued to operate during the government shutdown.</p> <p>As part of its aggressive immigration policy, the Trump administration has moved fast to increase the rate of arrests of undocumented immigrants, and scale up detention space and deportations. But the rapid pace of arrests has contributed to the backlog of millions of cases at immigration courts.</p> <p>Over the past 10 months, EOIR has lost more than 125 judges to firings and voluntary resignations, down from about 700 judges at the start of the year. The loss has resulted in immigration cases being delayed as far out as 2029, NPR previously reported, as vacancies increase despite open job postings to fill roles in those courts.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Congress approved a spending bill that allocated over $3 billion to the Justice Department for immigration-related activities, including the hiring of more immigration judges.</p>

<div class="article-title">Pakistan bans hard-line Islamist party known for its fierce anti-blasphemy stance</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>ISLAMABAD — Pakistan banned a hard-line Islamist party on Thursday, more than a week after heated clashes with police that left at least five people dead.</p> <p>The ban follows a march by the party, Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan<strong> </strong>(TLP), earlier this month from the eastern city of Lahore to the capital city, Islamabad. It escalated into a vicious street battle between TLP supporters and police in Lahore and the nearby city of Murdike, leading to a crackdown on the party, which has come to be known for these violent confrontations.</p> <p>A statement from the office of Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the ban was unanimously approved by the federal cabinet, citing "violent and terrorist activities." The ban is the latest chapter in a complicated relationship between the Pakistani state and the TLP, which has amassed considerable grassroots support in recent years for its hard-line views, particularly on blasphemy or the denigration of Islam.</p>
<p>According to Pakistan's blasphemy laws, people who insult Islam or Islamic figures can face a possible death sentence. The TLP demands death as a punishment, and human rights groups say the party's supporters sometimes carry out brutal mob lynchings even before people accused of blasphemy go on trial. Pakistan has seen a significant spike in blasphemy cases in recent years, in line with the TLP's rise.</p> <p>The TLP was officially launched as a political party in 2017 by a fiery cleric, though its ideology took hold earlier, following the 2011 assassination of the governor of Pakistan's populous Punjab province, Salman Taseer, who was outspoken against the blasphemy laws. The murder led to a wave of support for the governor's killer, Mumtaz Qadri, one of Taseer's bodyguards, who was hailed by some as a hero and defender of Islam. The TLP is not considered a mainstream political party, but it has a large ideological support base, especially in Punjab province.</p> <p>The move to ban the party came from the government in Punjab, where the recent protests took place. Before the ban, police in Punjab raided the house of the TLP's leader, Saad Rizvi, and the government sealed mosques and seminaries associated with the party. Some of the party's affiliates are now also facing anti-terrorism charges, according to Punjab's information minister, Azma Bokhari.</p>
<p>"This is not a religious or political party — they hide behind religion to spread disorder and try to do politics over dead bodies," Bokhari said in an interview with local media.</p> <p>The TLP announced the protest as a show of solidarity with Palestinians following the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and protesters were set to gather in front of the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad. Ahead of the protest, the government suspended mobile internet service in the capital and cordoned off major roads with shipping containers to keep protesters out.</p>
<p>Khurram Iqbal, an associate professor of security studies at Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad, says both external and internal factors created the environment for this crackdown to take place, including Pakistan's recent realignment with the United States.</p> <p>"We can ill afford any pressure group charging on the American Embassy," he says.</p> <p>Azaz Syed, a senior Pakistani journalist, says the TLP recognized this dynamic as an opportunity.</p> <p>"They thought that they would raise the concern that Pakistan is supporting America, and America is bringing peace after a compromise with Israel," Syed says. "They wanted to further utilize it for gaining more support."</p>
<p>But Pakistan's civilian government and military leadership also took this as an affront, he says, contributing to the crackdown. "It meant that they are actually challenging them."</p> <p>The TLP was previously banned in 2021 after the party held violent protests in response to caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad published in France. The party called for the expulsion of the French ambassador, and thousands of people gathered in the streets to pressure the government to act on their demand. The ban was later removed with the condition that the TLP must refrain from violence.</p> <p>Pakistan's leaders have defended the current ban against the TLP as necessary to maintain public order. In an interview with local media, Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif called for a "hard state" approach against the party.</p>
<p>"Such religious extremist groups, which resort to violence and cause damage to property, cannot be tolerated in Pakistan," he said.</p> <p>Pakistan has also taken a hard-line approach toward other political parties, most recently the party of imprisoned former prime minister, Imran Khan, starting in 2023. Some leaders from Khan's party held protests last week against the crackdown on TLP, calling it unconstitutional.</p>

<div class="article-title">U.S. imposes sanctions on Colombia's president and family over drug trade allegations</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration imposed sanctions Friday on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade, sharply escalating tensions with the leftist leader of one of the closest U.S. allies in South America.</p> <p>The Treasury Department leveled the penalties against Petro; his wife, Veronica del Socorro Alcocer Garcia; his son, Nicolas Fernando Petro Burgos; and Colombian Interior Minister Armando Alberto Benedetti.</p>
<p>Petro "has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity," Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. "President Trump is taking strong action to protect our nation and make clear that we will not tolerate the trafficking of drugs into our nation."</p> <p>The move ramps up a growing clash between the Republican U.S. president and Colombia's first leftist leader, notably over deadly American strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats off South America.</p>
<p>This week, the Trump administration expanded its crackdown to the eastern Pacific Ocean, where much of the cocaine from the world's largest producers, including Colombia, is smuggled. And in an escalation of military firepower in the region, the U.S. military is sending an aircraft carrier to the waters off South America, the Pentagon announced Friday.</p> <p>The U.S. last month added Colombia, the top recipient of American assistance in the region, to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years.</p> <p>The penalties were expected after Trump recently said he would slash assistance to Colombia and impose tariffs on its exports, referring to Petro on social media in recent days as "an illegal drug leader."</p>
<p>"He's a guy that is making a lot of drugs," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday. "He better watch it, or we'll take very serious action against him and his country."</p> <p>After Trump accused him of having ties to drug trafficking, Petro on Wednesday said he would resort to the U.S. court system to defend himself.</p> <p>"Against the calumnies that high-ranking officials have hurled at me on U.S. soil, I will defend myself judicially with American lawyers in the U.S. courts," Petro wrote on X without naming Trump but citing a news report about his comments.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Petro's anti-drug policy was the subject of a meeting between him and the U.S. chargé d'affaires in Colombia, John T. McNamara. McNamara also met with Foreign Minister Rosa Yolanda Villavicencio Mapy on Thursday.</p>
<p>Petro has repeatedly defended his policy, which moves away from a repressive approach and prioritizes reaching agreements with growers of coca leaf — the raw material for cocaine — to encourage them to switch to other crops, pursuing major drug lords and combating money laundering. He has said his government has achieved record cocaine seizures and questioned U.N. figures showing record coca leaf cultivation and cocaine production.</p> <p>The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares (625,000 acres) in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. That is about triple the size of New York City.</p> <p>The Trump administration has surged military ships and planes to Latin America to target traffickers accused of funneling drugs to the U.S. Petro has pushed back against the strikes that have killed at least 37 people since they started last month, with the latest two targeting vessels in the eastern Pacific, where Colombia has a coastline.</p> <p>Petro has repeatedly feuded with Trump this year. Petro initially rejected U.S. military flights of deported migrants, leading Trump to threaten tariffs. The State Department said it would revoke Petro's visa when he attended the U.N. General Assembly in New York because he told American soldiers to disobey Trump's orders.</p>

<div class="article-title">Coffee-driven deforestation is making it harder to grow coffee, watchdog group says</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>As the world's thirst for coffee shows no signs of slowing down, widely used practices to ramp up the crop's production have become self-defeating, according to a nonprofit watchdog group.</p> <p>In Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, coffee farming is driving deforestation — and that, in turn, makes coffee harder to grow.</p> <p>More than 1,200 square miles of forest were cleared for coffee cultivation in Brazil's coffee-growing areas between 2001 and 2023, according to a new report from the group Coffee Watch. The group used satellite images, government land use data and a forest-loss alert system in its analysis.</p>
<p>Overall, in areas with a high concentration of coffee-growing operations, a total of more than 42,000 square miles of forest are now gone, the report said. This includes forest loss caused directly by coffee farming — where land was cleared to grow the crop — as well as indirectly, from nearby road and infrastructure projects, for example.</p> <p>"Coffee essentially punched a Honduras-sized hole in Brazilian forests," says Etelle Higonnet, Coffee Watch's founder and director, noting that the Central American country has a similar land area to what's been lost.</p>
<p>To be clear, coffee is not the leading cause of deforestation in Brazil. Cattle ranching is responsible for a far larger share, Higonnet notes, but she says coffee's role in deforestation has not been talked about enough.</p> <p>Scientists have shown how deforestation leads to less rainfall in tropical rainforests. That's because the trees there soak up and release moisture, which rises to create clouds and more rain. Cutting down trees disrupts the cycle, reducing rainfall and leading to drought.</p> <p>Drought, of course, makes it harder to grow coffee.</p> <p>"When you kill the forest, you're actually also killing the rains, which is exactly what your crop needs to thrive in the long run," Higonnet says. "Even for people who don't much care about climate change and mass extinction, if they drink coffee and care about having coffee in the long run, this should be very scary for them."</p>
<p>Most years of the past decade have seen rainfall deficits in Brazil's major coffee-growing areas, the report says.</p> <p>Farmers are expanding to respond to the world's "insatiable demand for coffee," says Aaron Davis, a senior research leader of crops and global change at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England, with a longtime focus on coffee. "And to produce that coffee, you need land. Simple as that."</p>
<p>Davis says the report is "timely and useful." He was not involved in the study.</p> <p>"This will help to provide metrics on deforestation and start the conversation around the influence of coffee production on forest loss," he said.</p> <p>Coffee Watch's Higonnet credits Brazil's current administration, under leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, with making progress against deforestation. Brazil's Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, which works to prevent deforestation, has not responded to NPR's request for comment.</p> <p>Higonnet hopes the report spurs coffee businesses to refuse to buy coffee that was grown on deforested land. The National Coffee Association, a trade association for the U.S. coffee industry, has not responded to a request for comment on the report.</p> <p>More environmentally sustainable coffee-growing methods exist, such as using shade trees to shield some plants from the sun, and diversifying crops. But these methods typically don't yield as much coffee as industrialized production. Higonnet says the coffee-growing areas they studied in Brazil are by and large not using the sustainable agroforestry practices. Davis adds that more needs to be done to reward farmers who are being more sustainable.</p> <p>He says that the responsibility to encourage more sustainable coffee production extends to consumers.</p> <p>For coffee drinkers, Davis says, "I think there needs to be an awareness and a mind shift around the implications of purchasing products like coffee."</p>

<div class="article-title">It's been a rollercoaster few years for Six Flags. Can Travis Kelce help?</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end and fiance of Taylor Swift, sparked jokes and hopes this week when he announced his investment in the embattled amusement park company Six Flags Entertainment.</p> <p>The football star, alongside two corporate executives, teamed up with JANA Partners to purchase a combined stake of about 9% of Six Flags' shares, making them one of its largest shareholders, according to Tuesday's news release.</p>
<p>JANA Partners is an activist investment firm, meaning it buys a substantial stake in a company's equity in order to push for changes — both operational and managerial — it believes will benefit that company.</p> <p>"Couldn't pass up the opportunity to continue the tradition and make Cedar Point and Six Flags even more special for the next generation of families!" Kelce wrote on Instagram. "So crazy to even imagine this is real, but you gotta love it when life comes full circle."</p>
<p>Kelce also shared home video clips of himself as a child enjoying the rides at Cedar Point, the 364-acre amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, that he and his brother (and retired pro footballer) Jason grew up going to every year, as the two enthusiastically reminisced in an episode of their <em>New Heights </em>podcast. Kelce, who grew up in a suburb of Cleveland, calls himself a "lifelong Six Flags fan."</p> <p>Cedar Point's former operator, Cedar Fair, merged with Six Flags in 2024 to become the largest amusement park operator in North America, touting 42 parks across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>At the time, many amusement parks — and Six Flags especially — were struggling to increase attendance in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Park analysts and enthusiasts hoped the merger would lower ticket costs, raise revenue and make it more competitive against industry heavyweights like Disney and Universal.</p> <p>But that hasn't been the case, says Dennis Speigel, CEO of the consulting firm International Theme Park Services.</p> <p>"As this merger occurred, I think the due diligence was probably done a little too quickly and it had a lot of flaws in it," he told NPR. "And then it was also impacted by what I call the external factors: weather, economy, uncertainty of what's happening in geopolitical areas."</p>
<p>Six Flags now has $5.3 billion in debt. Its CEO, Richard Zimmerman, is set to step down by the end of the year, after it reported a net loss of $100 million for the second quarter of 2025 and combined attendance down 9% year-over-year. It is shuttering one of its parks — Six Flags America in Bowie, Md. — in early November and is expected to close another in Santa Clara, Calif., in 2027.</p>
<p>Speigel is hopeful the new shareholders will get Six Flags back on track. And while he was initially surprised to learn of Kelce's involvement, he says it makes sense because "he's at the zenith of his career in football … and in love."</p> <p>"Having a name like that be associated with Six Flags at this point in time, when they've gone through quite a few years recently of negativity, speaks well to their future and what they're looking to do," he says. "Obviously, he's a younger person. He speaks to the teens, the young adults and the young adults with families. And that's the Six Flags audience."</p> <p>Kelce's fame — and high-profile love story — have boosted businesses before. Swift is credited with increasing female NFL viewership and ticket sales as their relationship unfolded. And, in recent days, his social media announcement has been flooded with fans' pleas for a Swift-themed park, or at least a rollercoaster.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Six Flags' rocky ride </h3> <p>Six Flags opened with the "Six Flags Over Texas" park in 1961, and for years was one of America's most iconic theme park companies (along with Disney). But for the last decade, Speigel says, it has been "a ship at sea without a captain."</p> <p>"I would have to say [out of] the top five or six operators during the last couple of years, Six Flags has suffered the most," he says.</p> <p>Six Flags has had four CEOs since 2015.</p>
<p>It shifted its pricing strategy in 2022 to target a more affluent demographic, confusing and alienating core customers in the process. And in recent years, a number of high-profile ride malfunctions have stranded and even injured visitors. This year, extreme temperatures and economic uncertainty drove attendance down even further.</p> <p>"To see Six Flags have fallen off the precipice and down to where it is now, it's sad," Speigel says. "And everybody in the industry, competitors and alike, are all rooting for their return and their comeback."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">What might change? </h3> <p>JANA Partners said in its announcement that it plans to engage with Six Flags' management and board of directors "regarding opportunities to enhance shareholder value and improve the guest experience."</p>
<p>NPR has reached out to Jana Partners for more information about its goals but did not hear back by publication time.</p> <p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reports that the investment firm wants to "modernize technology, refresh leadership and evaluate a potential sale as ways to boost the company's share price."</p> <p>In a statement shared with NPR, a Six Flags spokesperson said it appreciates the perspectives of shareholders and takes their feedback seriously.</p> <p>Speigel says Six Flags' debt could force the new investors to take "some drastic measures," like selling some of its parks, either to commercial real estate or even private equity groups. And he stresses that foot traffic is key in the industry.</p>
<p>"We live on repeat visitation, and repeat visitation is driven by capital improvements, new rides and attractions, dark rides, the new technologies," he says. "So we have to hopefully see the growth from that."</p> <p>Speigel says even though U.S. amusement parks may not be experiencing the same rate of growth that they did several decades ago, they still attract some 400 million visitors each year — most of whom don't care who owns a park as long as their experience is clean, fun and safe.</p> <p>He hopes JANA recognizes Six Flags, and the industry in general, as "the last real bastion of family fun in the United States, in fact globally, where a family can go as a total unit. And I hope they put their capital behind that and lift it out of the ashes where it is now."</p>

<div class="article-title">The federal government is still shut down. Here's what that means across the country</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The federal government shutdown continues and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to an agreement to end it. </p> <p>The Senate failed to advance a pair of competing measures to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown. </p> <p>It's payday for many federal employees who will not be receiving a paycheck — the first full paycheck they've missed as part of the shutdown. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has tried to cast doubt on that.</p> <p><em>Read more on the impact to federal employees, here.</em></p>
<p>The Agriculture Department says it will reopen about 2,100 county offices despite the government shutdown to help farmers get access to $3 billion of aid. At the same time many American farmers say the Trump administration's trade policies have them on the brink.</p> <p>As the shutdown drags on, here's the latest on what we know.</p> <p><em>Jump to state-specific impacts.</em></p>
<p><strong>Why did the federal government shut down?</strong></p> <p>A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.</p> <p>Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the heath care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.</p> <p>Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer.</p>
<p>NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock. That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when most states will send notices to subscribers laying out the cost of coverage without subsidies.</p>
<p>In Vermont, where notices started going out on Oct. 15, for example, some families are facing increases of $25,000, according to Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.</p> <p><em>Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here.</em></p> <p><em>Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as </em><em>a health care showdown</em><em>.</em></p> <p><em>— </em><em>Selena Simmons-Duffin</em><em>, NPR</em></p>
<p><strong>What the shutdown means for federal workers</strong><br/>Altogether, about 1.4 million civilian federal employees across the country are going without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C.</p> <p>Of those, roughly half are furloughed, which means they are not working and not getting paid, but expect to return to work once the federal shutdown is over.</p> <p>The other half have been deemed essential and so are continuing to work.</p> <p>Thursday, the Senate failed to advance a pair of competing measures to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown.</p> <p>During the shutdown, the Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, including active duty military and law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security.</p> <p>Many other federal workers are also still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year.</p> <p><strong>Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown?</strong></p> <p>The Trump administration has been following through on threats to<strong> </strong>further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month. Some unions that represent workers are fighting back in court; the judge overseeing the case issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to pause reduction in force (RIF) efforts that affect certain unionized employees.</p> <p><em>Read more about the case and how the Trump administration has reacted to the temporary court order</em></p>
<p><strong>How is the shutdown impacting active duty military? </strong></p> <p>The Trump administration earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn't miss a full paycheck earlier this month, but it only covered one pay cycle. Many are expecting their next paycheck at the end of this month.</p> <p>Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills.</p> <p><strong>What about WIC and SNAP benefits</strong>?</p> <p>Tens of millions of people are at risk of losing food and nutrition aid if the shutdown continues into November. That includes 7 million for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and nearly 42 million who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. Their debit-like cards were funded a month in advance through October, but the Trump administration has warned the program will run out of money Nov. 1. </p> <p>In a letter dated Oct. 10, the USDA told state agencies to hold off distributing November benefits "until further notice" because of insufficient funds. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has called on the agency to shift money from its contingency fund and other places to keep SNAP at least partially funded.</p> <p>Meanwhile, WIC was initially slated to lose funding after only a couple weeks. The Trump administration shifted $300 million in tariff revenue to keep it afloat, but the National WIC Association says that emergency funding will only last through October. It's calling for an additional $300 million to keep WIC operating for a couple more weeks. Some states could step in to help fill the gap, depending on their resources.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Jennifer Ludden</em><em>, NPR</em></p> <p><em>Read more on the impact to food aid for millions of Americans, here</em><em>. </em></p>
<p><strong>And what about school lunches?</strong></p> <p>Some state agencies say they may not have the funds to reimburse schools providing free and low-cost meals.</p> <p>Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, says some agencies have told her organization they don't have the money to pay schools back for meals during the shutdown.</p> <p>"There is a strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to make sure that kids have access to healthy meals at school, so we are hopeful that the administration and Congress will act before this becomes an issue."</p> <p>According to Pratt-Heavner, USDA released funds to regional offices for meals served in October. But some states report they have yet to receive any money, she said. Before the shutdown, USDA released a contingency plan outlining funds states could tap into to cover any gaps. A USDA spokesman did not directly answer NPR when asked if the agency would advance funding to state agencies should the shutdown persist.</p> <p>— <em>Kadin Mills,</em><em> NPR</em></p>
<p><strong>USPS is 'open for business as usual'</strong></p> <p>"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted," according to a statement by USPS. The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.</p> <p><strong>IRS furloughs nearly half its staff</strong></p> <p>A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.</p> <p>The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.</p>
<p><em>— </em><em>Scott Horsley</em><em>, </em>Andrea Hsu and Stephen Fowler, <em>NPR</em></p> <p><strong>National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees</strong></p> <p>On Oct. 20, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines.</p> <p>According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the "Democrat shutdown."</p> <p>Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Geoff Brumfiel</em><em>, NPR</em></p> <p>In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open.</p> <p><strong>Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might</strong></p> <p>Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.</p> <p>At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department.</p> <p>This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. According to multiple sources, the special education office is now left with just a handful of top executives and support staff.</p> <p>In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages.</p>
<p><em>— </em><em>Shannon Bond</em><em> and </em><em>Cory Turner</em><em>, NPR</em></p> <p>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's Corrinne Hess reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that student financial aid programs will continue, despite the shutdown.</p>
<p><strong>National Parks are a mixed bag</strong></p> <p>Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt. That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.</p> <p>As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails "will generally remain accessible to visitors" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.</p> <p>Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.</p> <p><strong>The Salem, Mass. visitor center will be open through Halloween thanks to community support</strong></p> <p>WBUR's Andrea Shea reports that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open.</p> <p>Shea reports that NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2.</p> <p><strong>Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue</strong></p> <p>Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue.</p>
<p>But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.</p> <p>In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters.</p> <p>Some furloughed employees at the Labor Department were brought back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. Friday, the SSA said the payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year, or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January.</p> <p><em>Read more on </em><em>how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown</em><em> from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin.</em></p> <p><strong>ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted</strong></p> <p>Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. "We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work," McLaughlin said.</p> <p>According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown.</p> <p>"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period," Noem posted on X last week. "By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a "super check" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period."</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, also according to a post last week from Noem, from funds appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Ximena Bustillo</em><em>, NPR</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Some viruses can play a deadly game of hide and seek inside the human body</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Viruses are tiny — and sneaky.</p> <p>So sneaky that some play a deadly game of hide and seek. The "seek" part is all too familiar: They're always looking for ways to infect humans. Their ability to hide is far less well-known and can have devastating implications.</p> <p>The human body holds several effective hiding spots that some of the world's nastiest viruses have discovered — like the eyes and the testes — that are beyond the reach of the immune system. It's here that submicroscopic viral RNA can safely linger.</p> <p>Often the human hosts have no idea. They'd fallen ill, then appeared to beat the virus. Their blood tested negative. They show no symptoms.</p>
<p>But that hidden virus is capable of springing back into action. It can emerge from hiding — either sickening the original host or slipping into semen or breast milk and infecting someone new.</p> <p>Which viruses have mastered this technique? A number of notorious ones from Zika to measles to highly deadly viruses like Nipah, Marburg and Lassa fever.</p> <p>And the virus that terrified the world in 2014: Ebola.</p> <p>In the decade since, the Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced more than its fair share of Ebola crises — with nine outbreaks, including one that is ongoing — and more than its fair share of hidden viruses that spring back into action.</p> <p>"Almost all the outbreaks recently — maybe not every single one of them but the vast majority — are traced back to a previous outbreak," says Dr. Elizabeth Higgs, who is with the Division of Clinical Research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. She says once the genetics of the virus are sequenced it is clear that many of the outbreaks haven't come from an animal — like a bat — but from a human who unwittingly carried the virus after surviving a previous outbreak.</p> <p>While most survivors will never start a new outbreak, it is happening enough that Higgs says, "I think it's top of the research agenda."</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>"Everybody was panicking"</strong></h3> <p>Dr. Soka Moses first grasped the significance of these virus hideouts a decade ago. It was in mid-March 2015 when people in his West African country of Liberia were heaving a collective sigh of relief.</p> <p>The country was emerging from a nightmare, recalls Moses, then the medical director at an Ebola treatment center. Nearly 5,000 people died over the previous year. Some perished in the streets, unable to find a hospital bed. Schools shuttered, markets closed.</p> <p>Finally, in early March of 2015, there were no more Ebola cases.</p> <p>But the crisis was not over.</p> <p>Shortly after Liberia had reached zero cases, Moses recalls sitting in a daily meeting led by Liberia's National Epidemic Response Team when "boom! A case was identified." As word got out, he says: "Everybody was panicking: 'Oh, my God. Are we starting this again?'"</p> <p>Part of the panic was the mystery. How could this woman have contracted Ebola when there were no active cases? The virus spreads easily when someone comes into contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, even sweat or saliva, but it was not clear where or how this new patient could have been exposed.</p> <p>Family members eventually pointed medical investigators to the woman's sexual partner. Five months ago he'd recovered from Ebola. "[He'd] tested negative on two different occasions," says Moses. "[He was] doing perfectly fine, no symptoms whatsoever."</p> <p>The man was terrified and, initially, avoided the authorities. "He thought he was in really big trouble," says Moses.</p> <p>Once he was reassured that he was not in trouble, he agreed to cooperate. The challenge for scientists: Find out if the virus was hiding somewhere in his body.</p> <p>They ultimately determined that the Ebola virus was no longer in his blood … but lived on in his testes and had been transmitted in his semen.</p>
<p>"So that was the first documented sexually transmitted case of Ebola virus disease," says Moses. While he'd read about a 1967 case in which another virus hid out in the body, the implications were now much clearer.</p> <p>This prompted Moses to act. He's now the director of PREVAIL or the Partnership for Research on Vaccines &amp; Infectious Diseases in Liberia, which studies the phenomenon of hidden viruses, among other things.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>The body's sanctuary sites</strong></h3> <p>Researchers have identified a number of spots where the viruses can hide — not only eyes and testes but also the brain, the placenta and vaginal fluids as well as the mammary glands.</p> <p>"We call them sanctuary sites," says Joel Montgomery, chief of the Viral Special Pathogens Branch at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the virus, these are havens protected from the immune system.</p> <p>Scientists think this is likely because these body parts are critical for survival — and vulnerable to damage if the immune system overreacts.</p> <p>For example, "in the process of making eggs and sperm, we mix and match the genes. So they're not really us anymore," says Dr. John Schieffelin, an associate professor at Tulane University School of Medicine. That means the immune system might see eggs or sperm as foreign invaders and try to attack them, so it's helpful if those parts of the body are outside the reach of the immune system.</p> <p>The brain has a special level of protection<strong> </strong>in the blood brain barrier which limits the entry of immune cells. As for the eye? "An eye doctor might scold me for this, but to me, it's really an extension of the brain. There's a large nerve that goes from your eye directly into your brain," Schieffelin says.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Many mysteries</strong></h3> <p>There's still a lot scientists don't know about how viruses behave in these sanctuary sites.</p>
<p>For example, exactly how long can a virus stay there? In many cases where individuals were tested, it appears to be a matter of months. In some cases, it's years. There have even been semen samples that test negative for the virus at one point then return to positive later. It's not clear to scientists what prompted this reversal. And researchers haven't followed enough people who've harbored one of these infections long enough to know the outer limit.</p> <p>Another big unknown: What is the virus doing in the sanctuary site? It seems as if it's almost dormant, barely replicating. "But we don't know why someone relapses. We don't know if it's a drop in their immune system or if there's some other factor," says Montgomery.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Fear and stigma</strong></h3> <p>Montgomery says the goal is to identify medications for survivors that can reach into sanctuary sites and root out any hidden virus. For this, he says, the size of the molecule in the drug is key.</p> <p>"We really need to explore the use of small-molecule drugs," he says, suggesting the smaller the drug's molecule the more likely it can penetrate the protective barrier around a sanctuary site.</p> <p>Moses' team has been studying exactly this with the drug remdesivir — and results have been promising. Survivors who got the drug cleared the virus from their semen more quickly than survivors who got the placebo.</p> <p>While many of the researchers are focused on the biology, something that's never far from their mind is the psychological part of the equation. Ebola survivors can face intense fear and stigma.</p> <p>When Dr. Dehkontee Dennis — who works at PREVAIL in Liberia — was enrolling for the study, she says she noticed "there was one thing that <em>all</em> of these men have expressed: They have this fear. They don't want to transmit the virus to their families. They want to have children. They want to stop using condoms [to prevent transmission]."</p>
<p>The flip side of their fear is that many of the community members — who may have lost their partners and other family members to Ebola — fear the survivors may still pose a threat, even if they don't know about sanctuary sites. "Community members did not even want them back in the communities," says Moses.</p> <p>This level of stigma makes it tricky to talk about the risk that the virus could hide in a survivor and then resurface. Survivors and their community need to know there's a chance this could happen, the scientists say — but only in a small percentage of cases.</p> <p>Reassurance can also come from survivor programs that test semen and vaccination campaigns to protect the community. But scientists say the solution will be finding medications that can ferret out these hidden, potentially lethal viruses.</p> <p>"It's great that we have vaccines," says Joel Montgomery of the CDC. "It's great that we have therapeutics. It's great that we're saving people's lives. But now we need to figure out a way to make sure the virus is completely eliminated from them."</p>

<div class="article-title">Argentina's President Milei, a Trump ally, faces a reckoning in midterm elections</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — The stakes were always high for Argentina's libertarian president, Javier Milei, in this weekend's midterm elections.</p>
<p>But now, with a currency crisis deepening and a controversial U.S. bailout on the way, the eccentric economist-turned-politician has more than political posturing riding on Sunday's vote.</p> <p>The elections — which will renew half the lower house and a third of the Senate — are a crucial test for a president who has made good on his promise to take a chainsaw to public spending.</p>
<p>In a recent televised interview, Milei called the elections "much more important than we think," warning that without a stronger presence in Congress, it's difficult to pass legislation.</p> <p>His party, La Libertad Avanza, holds just 37 of 257 seats in the lower chamber, relying on tenuous alliances with conservative blocs. But Congress has increasingly rejected his agenda, underscoring his eroding grip on power.</p> <p>Milei's political fortunes have nosedived in recent months. A series of corruption scandals — including allegations that his sister and closest confidant, Karina Milei, accepted bribes in a government medicine purchase — have tarnished his anti-establishment brand. The Milei siblings deny the accusations, but the damage was done: Protesters have pelted the president with rocks, and his movement lost ground in key legislative races, especially in Buenos Aires province, home to nearly 40% of Argentines.</p>
<p>The fallout was swift. The peso plunged, forcing the Central Bank to burn through reserves to stem the slide. Argentina still faces multibillion-dollar payments to the International Monetary Fund in 2026.</p> <p>In response, Washington stepped in with an unprecedented $20-billion currency swap. The Trump administration says it will seek another $20 billion from private banks and sovereign wealth funds to stabilize the peso — a move that's drawn criticism from Americans struggling under domestic spending cuts.</p> <p>President Trump initially hinted the deal was contingent on Milei's success in Sunday's vote, but Argentina's Central Bank later confirmed an agreement with the U.S. Treasury for an "exchange rate stabilization" package.</p>
<p>While Milei has managed to curb triple-digit inflation, austerity has taken a heavy toll. Roughly 50,000 public sector jobs have been cut, and subsidies slashed. His approval rating has sunk to historic lows — with disapproval now topping 60%, though polls suggest the outcome Sunday remains uncertain.</p> <p>On Buenos Aires streets, anger is palpable.</p> <p>"I really don't think he loves Argentina," said Eva Marcilo, a retired teacher protesting outside Congress. "My medications used to be free; now I pay 60 or 80%. Food costs are impossible, my kids can't afford rent. Everyone's working more and earning less."</p> <p>Still, Milei retains a loyal following. At the launch of his latest book — staged like a rock concert — thousands turned out to cheer him on. Support among younger voters remains particularly strong.</p> <p>"For a long time, we lived the worst of the worst," said 21-year-old Jonatan Moreno, from the Argentine city of Córdoba. "Javier gives us hope that we didn't have before."</p>
