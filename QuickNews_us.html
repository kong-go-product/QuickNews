<div class="article-title">New Jersey Dem hopeful vows to sue Trump over troop deployments, says states would pay the price</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill on Monday vowed to sue the Trump administration if the president were to deploy National Guard troops to the Garden State. </p><p>Sherrill, who currently represents New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District, made the comments during a town hall broadcast live on Univision 41 Nueva York. The audience asked Sherrill questions in Spanish, and she responded in English. </p><p>An audience member who said his family had fled the Nicolás Maduro regime in Venezuela asked Sherrill what she would do if President Donald Trump deployed federal troops to New Jersey. </p><p>Sherrill, a former Navy veteran and federal prosecutor, said American troops "should not be on the streets of our country" – only in rare cases like an insurrection or a national crisis. She added that troops are not trained for policing missions like local law enforcement.  </p><p>"And that’s why, as governor, should Trump try to deploy troops on our streets, I would be very opposed to that. I’d immediately take him to court and demand that he stop this – because I think it’s illegal – and ensure that here in New Jersey, people are kept safe," Sherrill said.</p><p>Sherrill is running against Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli to replace term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. </p><p>Since returning to office in January, President Trump has either sent or threatened to send federal troops to nearly a dozen cities – including Baltimore, Los Angeles, and Memphis – that his administration has portrayed as crime-ridden and dangerous. </p><p>Illinois and Chicago have sued the Trump administration to stop the president from sending hundreds of National Guard troops to the Windy City. That legal challenge came after a federal judge blocked the guard’s deployment in Portland, Oregon. </p><p>The Trump administration has defended the deployments, saying they are necessary to curb violent crime and restore law and order. Several officials have pushed back, accusing the Trump administration of overreach and warning that federal intervention only inflames the situation. </p><p>Last month, a federal judge said the Trump administration "willfully" broke federal law by deploying Guard troops to Los Angeles earlier this year over protests about immigration raids. </p></body></div></body></html>

Each tool weighs just under five pounds and has an ergonomic comfort grip that's helpful when you're working all day. An LED light is built into both the drill and driver, making it easy to work in tight or dark areas.</p><p>A DeWalt cordless drill and impact driver set is a durable set that will last for years, even with frequent use. Both tools are compact and lightweight, coming in at less than three pounds each. Still, each tool packs a punch. The drill features two different speeds you can adjust based on the needed torque. Featuring an LED light, the drill helps you see more clearly as you're working.</p><p>Prime Big Deal Days is the time to stock up on tools, and DeWalt has a nine-piece tool combo kit that comes with a drill and impact driver as well as a reciprocating saw. Additionally, you get a circular saw, an oscillating multi-tool, an LED work light and an angle grinder. The impact driver features three LED lights for easier drilling. All tools with blades have keyless blade clamps that allow for quick and easy blade changes.</p><p>DeWalt makes a powerful orbital sander complete with a dust-sealed switch that protects the tool from getting clogged. It’s compatible with eight-hole hook-and-loop sanding pads. Thanks to the low-profile height, you can work closer to the surface so you can see exactly what and where you’re sanding.</p><p>Milwaukee's cordless angle grinder is an ideal tool for cutting pipe, grinding off rust and paint and much more. It features an electronic clutch that protects you from kickback. The anti-vibration side handle also keeps your hand comfortable and safe while grinding.</p><p>Metabo makes a lightweight circular saw that delivers 500 two-by-four cuts per charge. You don’t need to worry about a pesky cord getting in your way as you work, and the saw can cut up to five layers of half-inch plywood. Ideal for woodworkers and builders, the 53-degree bevel range allows you to make a variety of sharp cuts. It comes with a rafter hook so you can store it easily.</p><p>The Metabo brand nailer uses 18-gauge brad nails from 5/8-inch to two inches in length. The lightweight nailer comes with an air compressor and includes a no-mar tip that won't leave indents in wood. You get complete control over the tool and can select between bump fire or sequential fire modes.</p><p>Woodworking projects, roof installations and any other projects that require nails can go a lot faster with a Craftsman cordless brad nailer. There's no air compressor needed, just use any Craftsman battery and get to work. It can withstand intense weather like snow or extreme heat. This is a lightweight model with an over-molded handle for comfortable handling.</p><p>This table saw is one you can bring with you to any job site. It's a solid pick for anyone serious about DIY projects or home renovations. The work rive gearing delivers more torque and cutting power than your average saw, making it perfect for tough jobs. With a 3-5/8-inch cutting depth and a 30.5-inch rip capacity, you can handle everything from plywood sheets to four-by-fours.</p><p>Everyone needs a place to work safely, and these workbenches can help provide that. We also include some storage solutions to keep your tools organized. </p><p>Bring your workbench anywhere with this two-in-one folding work table. You can transition easily between a workbench and a sawhorse, so you get the best of both worlds. When it’s set up as a workbench, it’ll hold up to 300 pounds. As a sawhorse, it’ll hold an impressive 1,000 pounds. The integrated clamping system helps you avoid lugging around extra equipment. You get two 24-inch clamps that firmly grip wood or metal.</p><p>Get your workspace more organized with this 48-inch work table. The rubber and wood tabletop is strong and easy to clean after sanding and sawing. There’s also a pegboard where you can hang your tools, cords and other organizational systems. Conveniently access power with built-in power outlets and cord organizers that keep cords out of the way as you work.</p><p>You can better organize your tools with an Olympia Tools Pack-N-Roll cart. It has a 150-pound capacity, so it's best for smaller power tools and hand tools. The three shelves collapse, so you can add extra space for taller tools. You can also collapse the whole service cart if you want to store it away.</p><p>Instead of constantly searching everywhere for screws, anchors or nails, organize them in this Akro-Mils plastic storage cabinet. Built with 24 plastic drawers, there's plenty of space for all your small tools. You can personalize the cabinet by choosing from black, yellow, red or white cabinets. </p><p>Not every project requires a power tool. Amazon has all the basics you need to fill your toolbox. </p><p>It’s always a good idea to have a measuring tape on hand when you’re working. A well-known brand, Craftsman makes a simple 25-foot measuring tape that is durable and easy to read. The compact size means you can clip it to your tool belt, and the easy grip design makes for quick measuring.</p><p>A good screwdriver set can help with everyday projects. This Craftsman screwdriver set includes 14 different tools, all with alloy-steel blades that are heat-treated for added durability. The handles provide a comfortable grip that helps make quick work of any screw.</p><p>Easily detect the voltage on an outlet or breaker you're changing with this ACV detector. Just fit into the socket, or run it over loose wires, and it'll light up if it detects power. There's both an audible and silent mode for added convenience.</p><p>This 308-piece Craftsman tool set includes a socket wrench set, an assortment of traditional wrenches and a screwdriver with specialty bits made for mechanics. All tools are made with a full polished chrome finish so they won't corrode or rust.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Liberal critics target Bari Weiss after CBS News Editor-in-Chief appointment announcement</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Bari Weiss, the Free Press founder who was tapped yesterday as editor-in-chief at CBS News, is being smeared.</p><p>I can tell you, from having interviewed her – and followed the extraordinary online news and commentary site she created – that this is an extremely smart and talented woman. </p><p>She was a top opinion editor at the New York Times, where she melded liberal views – she couldn’t stand Donald Trump – with more conservative stances, such as believing the Democrats have moved too far left on some issues. Weiss resigned after three years, following what she described as "bullying by colleagues."</p><p>"Intellectual curiosity" was "now a liability at the Times," she said, and some colleagues "called me a Nazi and a racist…Showing up for work as a centrist at an American newspaper should not require bravery."</p><p>CBS, now controlled by the billionaire Ellison family, along with parent company Paramount, is a very different place. Larry Ellison, the Oracle co-founder, is a Trump pal. And the old network had drawn flak for the misleading "60 Minutes" Kamala Harris interview, which led to a $16-million settlement of the president’s lawsuit.</p><p>With the new CBS buying Free Press for $150 million, Bari will be pretty wealthy – and that fueled the online backlash. Many libs are outrageously portraying Bari as a right-wing nutjob.</p><p>Jamelle Bouie, an ultra-liberal columnist at the Times: "A heartwarming story of how being an unethical and talentless hack is no barrier to your success when you are willing to endlessly flatter the ratchet views of rich dipshits."</p><p>Walker Bragman: "Bari Weiss is a misinformation-peddling right-wing operative. She is totally unqualified for this job."</p><p>Nikole Hannah-Jones, author of the Times’ hugely controversial 1619 Project: "Zero news experience. Never been a reporter."</p><p>Well, let’s look at a former CBS News president, Sean McManus, who I know quite well. He took a series of production and management jobs in sports, became president of CBS Sports, and then was handed the news division as well. He’s never been a reporter either. I don’t recall anyone questioning his credentials. So that’s a bogus argument.</p><p>And how incompetent could she be to build from scratch an organization that is worth a small fortune? </p><p>"The values that we’ve hammered out here over the years — journalism based in curiosity and honesty, a culture of healthy disagreement, our shared belief in America’s promise — now have the opportunity to go very, very big," she posted yesterday.</p><p>"What does this mean for CBS News? It means a redoubled commitment to great journalism. It means building on a storied legacy—and bringing that historic newsroom into 2025 and beyond. Most of all, it means working tirelessly to make sure CBS News is the most trusted news organization in the world."</p><p>That may take a while. A Pew Research survey found 39 percent trusting CBS News and 23 percent distrusting it.</p><p>Bari, who also worked at the Wall Street Journal, founded the Free Press with her wife, Nellie Bowles, creating a must-read site with a vast array of opinions and 1.5 million subscribers (some of them paid).</p><p>In our "Media Buzz" interview this year, Bari confirmed that she sobbed at her desk when Trump won the White House in 2016.</p><p>"Look, I'm the first to admit that I was a sufferer of what conservatives at the time called TDS, Trump Derangement Syndrome, and I was alarmed and really nervous about everything I was reading,"</p><p>And now? "What I didn't see was that Trump was going to do a lot of policies that I agreed with. I thought the Abraham Accords were historic and excellent. I thought his policy vis-a-vis Iran was excellent. The economy was better.</p><p>"And look, the argument that the country would unravel and democracy would die in darkness and Trump would be this authoritarian, Hitlerian power, it was impossible to make that argument in the run-up to this election only because Americans had lived through four years of him and things didn't fall apart."</p><p>So how did she wind up at the Times in the first place?</p><p>"Howie, I was a diversity hire," she said, not really joking.</p><p>Bari started getting plenty of speaking invitations from conservatives, and recalls one in particular: "A consistently liberal Jewish lesbian from Pittsburgh. Who's a journalist, and I was being invited to the Federalist Society. It seemed kind of insane."</p><p>I asked her whether hanging out with zillionaires as she was raising money had changed her. She said she didn’t think so but understood how others might view it differently.</p><p>Anyone who doubts her knowledge of how television works should look at her "Honestly" podcast. Her guests have ranged from Marco Rubio to Rahm Emanuel, from Amanda Knox to Mike Huckabee, from Andrew Cuomo to Amy Coney Barrett.</p><p>Her finesse, and knowledge of movies, were recently on display in her 98-minute video podcast with Woody Allen. </p><p>She got him to talk about the Knicks, love affairs, death, and why he doesn’t care what people think of him. But she also pressed him aggressively on the accusations, which he denies and were never proven, of child sexual abuse and how that scandal affected his life. When Woody was awkwardly silent, she just waited him out.</p><p>That’s why the left-wing sliming of the "consistently liberal" Bari Weiss, perhaps tinged by a bit of jealousy, is missing the mark. But reshaping the battered CBS News will be no small challenge.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced Monday on X that the Lone Star State’s elite National Guard units are deploying "now" after receiving a request to help protect federal property. </p><p>In the brief post, Abbott wrote, "The elite Texas National Guard. Ever ready. Deploying now." </p><p>The short but commanding message underlines the governor’s confidence in the state’s ability and willingness to act in defense of the nation.</p><p>Texas officials say the deployment is being coordinated with the White House’s plans to reinforce security in several cities that have seen spikes in protests targeting federal facilities, including Chicago and Portland.</p><p>President Donald Trump called for the additional support from cooperating states, saying that the troops would "protect federal workers and property from escalating threats."</p><p>Democratic governors, however, are pushing back. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker called the move "an invasion," and Oregon officials are seeking to block deployments through court orders.</p><p>"It started with federal agents. It will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state’s military troops," Pritzker said.</p><p>Texas Gov.

<div class="article-title">California's redistricting plan sparks fierce debate in 2026 governor's race</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>California's controversial plan to redraw its congressional maps mid-decade is among the most pressing issues discussed by <span class="link">candidates in the 2026 gubernatorial race</span>.</p><p>Proposition 50, placed on the ballot by the state legislature for a November special election, would authorize California lawmakers to redraw the state's congressional districts before the 2030 Census.</p><p>The redistricting effort, backed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, <span class="link">would shift five of the state's U.S. House seats</span> to be more favorable to Democrats in next year's midterm elections. California Democrats call it a countermeasure to <span class="link">Texas' recent redistricting</span>, which favors Republicans in the midterms. </p><p>Unlike in Texas, California voters took the power to draw these maps away from lawmakers in 2020 and established an independent redistricting commission. Proposition 50 would give that power back to lawmakers for the next five years.</p><p>Over several weeks in September, CBS News California Investigates sat down with each candidate to ask questions on a variety of issues that matter to voters, including Proposition 50. </p>
<p>While Democratic candidates generally backed Proposition 50 along party lines, some admitted unease when pressed on the details. Republican and Green Party opponents defended their opposition as they responded to arguments in favor of the measure.</p>
<h2>What do you think of the governor's plan?</h2>
<p>Candidates shared their views with CBS California Investigates on Governor Newsom's Prop 50 redistricting proposal. At the time of the interviews, Democratic leaders framed it as a plan to "Stop Trump's Power Grab.</p><p>Former Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat who served as Health and Human Services Secretary in the Biden administration, defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington, saying it would "make sure that Donald Trump doesn't put his thumb on the scale on the votes in Congress."</p><p>Republican candidate Steve Hilton condemned the plan, saying outright that it is "totally corrupt and it's unconstitutional and it is illegal."</p>
<p>"Politicians shouldn't draw their own maps," Hilton said. "I mean, that's obviously wrong and corrupt. Common sense tells you that."</p><p>Former state Assemblymember Ian Calderon, also a Democrat, said he supports the plan and emphasized California's position as a donor state.</p><p>"At the end of the day, if we're going to have hope of any type of leverage throughout the next couple of years during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress, so that we could fight back and secure the money that is coming to California," Calderon said.</p><p>Republican candidate Leo Zacky called the proposal "unconstitutional," criticizing the avenue the state has taken to redraw its districts.</p><p>"The way that it's set up is that we, the people, are supposed to figure out how the districts are supposed to be drawn," he said. "[Newsom is] violating the Constitution. He's spending a ton of money doing it. It's trash. It's a waste."</p><p>Green Party candidate Butch Ware accused Democrats of consolidating power under the guise of fighting Republican overreach.</p><p>"In the state of California, are y'all feeling that this has been a state that has been well-run and for your best interest? So you're going to essentially hand them the keys to make sure that they own every district in the state? You imagine thinking that you can fight fascism with fascism," Ware said.</p>
<p>While Democratic former State Controller Betty Yee called the redistricting effort "essential" to prevent the manipulation of elections, "as the president has asked the state of Texas to do."</p><p>"We have a process for this. It's after every decennial census… And just the idea that there is manipulation that is being directed from the top, that's going to affect California's representation, our proportionate representation," Yee said. "We have to fight that."</p><p>Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, who is running as a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is California's opportunity to counter "gerrymandering coming out of states like Texas."</p><p>"Not only will it give voters something better and the chance to gain five new Democratic seats. We're doing it in a way that is transparent," he said. "We're going to do it in a way that lets the voters decide."</p><p>Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, also a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is a necessary response to Republican attempts to rig elections elsewhere.</p><p>"Let the people decide, and I'm for it. I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do," Villaraigosa said.</p><p>Businessman Steve Cloobeck, a Democrat, supported the plan and said "we have to preserve Democracy." Another Democrat, Katie Porter, who's a law professor and former member of Congress, said she is in "support of the governor's plan."</p>
<p>Republican Sheriff Chad Bianco of Riverside County expressed opposition.</p><p>"It's like saying murder is not acceptable, so I'm going to go murder you," Bianco said. "Let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more."</p><h2>Message to Californians who voted for Trump</h2>
<p>The Democratic candidates also explained their message   to the roughly 40% of California voters who supported Donald Trump in 2020, voters whose political representation could be diminished under the new district maps.</p><p>The Republican and Green Party Proposition 50 opponents also defended their opposition to pro-redistricting arguments.</p><p>Becerra said he would talk to them "straight out" and emphasized his intention to win every vote. Becerra also emphasized that now is the time to stand up for the rule of law and Democracy.</p><p>"No one should do power grabs. No one is a king. No one has a right to deny you your vote," he said.</p><p>Like Becerra, Calderon said his campaign would focus on listening to all voters, not just talking at them.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of Republicans in the state who don't necessarily love everything Trump is doing," Calderon said. "They just want to be heard."</p><p>Thurmond echoed similar arguments, saying that many of Mr. Trump's voters may not support all of the president's policies.</p><p>"Most Americans do not support attacks on the immigrant communities or education cuts," he said. "Just because they voted for Trump doesn't mean they agree with everything."</p><p>Yee acknowledged that some voters, particularly in rural Republican districts, may feel disenfranchised.</p><p>"What I will say to them also is, look, these are areas of the state that actually want to become vital economies. These are areas that actually have probably disproportionate rates of people on Medicaid. These are parts of the states where people are relying on food assistance more than probably other parts," Yee said. "I would just say, who's going to best represent those interests when those cuts are upon you?"</p><p>Businessman Steve Cloobeck emphasized loyalty to California's interests rather than party politics.</p><p>"I would look at the polls of the state right now. The polls say protect California. Whatever the California customers want, I will be their leader and represent them," Cloobeck said.</p>
<p>Villaraigosa said he expects to alienate some voters on both sides, but believes many are still looking for leadership that bridges divides.</p><p>"I know there are Democrats that I might alienate in the course of this race, and there will be Republicans I alienate. There will also be Democrats and some Republicans that want a leader who's a uniter who wants to work with both sides, who wants the focus on common sense. So you win a few, you lose a few."</p><p>Porter, who has represented a swing district in Orange County, was the only candidate not to directly answer the question, taking issue with the premise that she might need republican voters to win.</p><p>"How would I need them in order to win?" Porter asked. "If it is me versus a Republican, I think that I will win the people who did not vote for Trump."</p><p>As several of her opponents noted, in California's top-two open primary system, Republican voters could help put a Democratic candidate over the top.  </p><p>Porter then threatened to call off the interview, taking issue with too many follow-up questions. She ultimately stayed and continued answering questions. </p><h2>Do two wrongs make a right?</h2>
<p>The candidates also confronted the ethical dilemma that even some Prop 50 supporters acknowledge: Does fighting one partisan maneuver with another set the wrong precedent? In other words, do two wrongs make right? </p>
<p>"It's let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more," Bianco said.</p><p>Becerra defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington.</p><p>"Donald Trump is afraid he's going to lose his slim majority of Republicans come 2026," Becerra said. "So he's trying to rig the process to give himself more Republicans. That is not a Democratic process. We're going to fight as we need to make sure our votes count."</p><p>Calderon offered a conflicted view, calling it "kind of a sh---- choice" but emphasizing the political stakes.</p><p>"If we're going to have hope of any type of leverage during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress."</p><p>Ware warned voters not to fall for partisan manipulation.</p><p>"This doesn't serve the voters of California. It serves the DNC. It does not help us. It helps them," Ware said. "They are using Californians essentially as a prop in their battle between Democrats and Republicans."</p>
<p>Porter said it's not two wrongs, highlighting the nature in which Texas approached its redistricting.</p><p>"What Texas is doing is acting out of the course of the census, not following new census data… They're doing it because Donald Trump instructed them to do it," she said.</p><p>Villaraigosa said he's for letting the people decide on the matter to challenge corruption.</p><p>"I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do," he said.</p><p>Thurmond called the special election on Proposition 50 "an important moment for voters to decide."</p><p>Yee reaffirmed her stance on California's move to counter Texas' redistricting effort.</p><p>"Just the idea that there's manipulation that is being directed from the top that's going to affect California's proportionate representation, we have to fight back," she said.</p>
<p>Cloobeck also highlighted California's position as a donor state.</p><p>"Donald Trump's actions have been such that he wants to just attack California. He has not shown us any gratitude for all the billions of dollars of tax dollars the federal government gets from California," he said.</p><p>Hilton described the difficulty California faces in properly redrawing its congressional districts mid-decade rather than after the federal census every 10 years.</p><p>"By drawing these maps in the middle, they don't know who lives where," he said. "Millions of people have left California. In Los Angeles, whole communities have burned down. Who knows who lives there? There's no way that they can honor that constitutional requirement."</p><p>Hilton stressed that even before Newsom's redistricting effort, California already had "a massively distorted political map."</p><p>Acknowledging that Republicans make up about 40% of the vote in California but have just 17% of the congressional seats, Hilton said, "With this new plan that they've got, it would be down to 6%."</p><p>Hilton argued that those voters are being pushed out of representation altogether, saying that the plan would unfairly increase the weight of Democratic votes by as much as eight times compared to Republican ones.</p>
<p>"We're completely violating the principle of equal protection, the whole idea," Hilton said.</p><p>While candidates differ sharply on Proposition 50, voters will have the final say. The redistricting plan will go before voters in a special election on November 4. If approved, the new congressional maps would remain intact through the 2030 election.</p>

<div class="article-title">Illinois, Chicago sue to block National Guard, but troops already deployed</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>As Illinois and Chicago filed suit to block the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, a judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order Monday afternoon, and it was revealed that troops are already on their way. </p><p>"The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president's favor," the lawsuit states in its introduction.</p><p>In the lawsuit, which names both the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago as plaintiffs, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul writes, "Defendants' deployment of federalized troops to Illinois is patently unlawful." He continues, "Plaintiffs ask this court to halt the illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional federalization of members of the National Guard of the United States, including both the Illinois and Texas National Guard." </p><p>Raoul is asking for a temporary restraining order, saying deployment will cause "additional unrest," "mistrust of police," and harm to the state's economy. </p><p>In court, defense attorneys in this case were asked a series of logistical questions, like what cities in Illinois the National Guard would be deployed and they couldn't provide the answers.  </p>
<p>The judge said that while she was troubled by the lack of information and details of the operation, she will give those attorneys a couple more days to respond. She did caution lawyers for the Trump administration, "If I were the federal government, I'd take a pause on this."</p><p>The judge did not issue a restraining order during Monday's status hearing, instead setting another hearing for arguments on Thursday.   </p>
<p>However, it was revealed in court that National Guard troops from Texas are already on their way to Illinois and could be deployed as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday. The Illinois National Guard was ordered to report on Tuesday for training, according to state attorneys.</p><p>In a Monday afternoon news conference, Pritzker repeatedly decried what he called the Trump administration's "unconstitutional invasion" of Chicago, and said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and other administration officials are expanding raids and military-style enforcement actions in order to sow chaos that would then justify the deployment of military troops to Chicago. </p>
<p>"The state of Illinois is going to use every lever at our disposal to resist this power grab and get Noem's thugs the hell out of Chicago," Pritzker said. "I am not afraid. I am <em>not</em> afraid. And I will not back down."</p><p>"The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military," said AG Raoul. "Particularly for the reason that their city or state leadership have fallen out of the president's political favor."</p><p>Raoul said the state has filed more than 40 lawsuits against the Trump administration so far. He cited the militia clauses of the U.S. Constitution, which give Congress the sole authority to decide where troops are deployed, and the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits military troops from participating in civilian law enforcement.</p><p>"It is unfair to National Guardsmen, it is unfair to local law enforcement, and it is certainly unfair to the law-abiding citizens of Illinois who do not want to be subject to military occupation," Raul said.</p><p>Raoul said the only situation in the city or state that is "out of control" are the ICE agent,s whose overreach he said creates pretext for military deployment, and cited President Trump's own statements that he wants to use American cities as military training grounds and said Chicago "is about to find out why it's called the Department of War."</p><p>"I'm here to say that the president's actions are illegal," Raoul said. "The president has failed to establish that any of the legal prerequisites exist for his efforts to mobilize his National Guard troops here."</p><p>Mayor Brandon Johnson said the lawsuit sends "a message to the president that Chicago will not be used as a political prop. Chicago will not be intimidated and will not be silent."</p>
<p>"Our city has faced tough times before, and every time we stood strong, because we stood together," Johnson said. "Let's continue to work together to protect our democracy and fight for the future of our country."</p><p>U.S. Senators for Illinois Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth released a statement in conjunction with other Illinois Democrats, demanding Mr. Trump reverse his decision to deploy National Guard troops.</p><p>"We write to urge you to reverse your reckless decision to federalize and deploy Texas and Illinois National Guard troops to Illinois.  Your use of the military to sow fear and chaos in American cities, including over the objections of several Governors, is unconstitutional and un-American, infringes on individual and states' rights, and threatens to undermine military readiness and morale," wrote the lawmakers in part.</p><p><span class="link">Over the weekend</span>, a <span class="link">federal memo obtained by CBS News</span> revealed up to 300 members of the Illinois National Guard would be federalized and deployed to "protect federal property" and "government personnel performing federal functions."</p><p>Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker confirmed that memo and said he had also been told an additional 400 other National Guard members from Texas would be deployed to Chicago and Portland, Oregon.</p><p>A <span class="link">federal judge temporarily blocked the deployment of the National Guard to Portland on Sunday</span>.  </p>

<div class="article-title">Hurricane Priscilla intensifying off southwest Mexico. Maps show forecast path.</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Hurricane Priscilla will become a more powerful storm this week as it continues to strengthen over the Pacific Ocean off southwest Mexico. The National Hurricane Center, which is based in Miami, said the storm was expected to bring heavy rains and gusty winds to the region.</p><p>The Mexican government issued a tropical storm watch for Baja California Sur on Monday morning, stretching from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lozaro. A previous tropical storm watch from Manzanillo to Punta Mita, Mexico, was discontinued Monday night.</p><h2>Hurricane Priscilla's track and forecast</h2><p>On its forecast track, Priscilla's center "is expected to move offshore of and parallel to the coast of southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur through the early-to-middle part of this week," the hurricane center said in an advisory. It is expected to continue moving toward the northwest "at a slightly faster forward speed" in the coming days, the NHC said.</p><p>"Additional strengthening is forecast, and Priscilla is expected to become a category 2 hurricane, and could  approach major hurricane status within the next couple of days," it added. Priscilla will likely start weakening by midweek.</p><p>Category 2 hurricanes have sustained winds of at least 96 mph. Major hurricane categories begin at 3, with minimum sustained winds of 111 mph.</p>
<p>As of the NHC's 10 p.m. ET update on Monday, the storm was located about 205 miles west-southwest of Cabo Corrientes, near the resort town of Puerto Vallarta, and about 275 miles south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. </p>
<p>It was traveling northwest at 9 mph with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph.</p>
<p>Although Priscilla is forecast to remain several hundred miles from the Mexican coast, heavy rain, tropical storm-force winds and swells are possible in places that the storm is due to pass on its path, said CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan.</p>
<p>"Outer bands from Priscilla will continue to bring heavy rain to portions of southwestern Mexico today," the hurricane center said, with 2-4 inches expected and up to 6 inches in some spots, enough to "bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain."</p><p>Swells generated by Priscilla have started affecting parts of the southwestern Mexico coast and will get to portions of the west-central Mexican coast and southern Baja California Peninsula today, the center cautioned, and the swells "are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions."</p>

<div class="article-title">Illegal crossings at U.S.-Mexico border plummet to lowest annual level since 1970</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2025 plummeted to the lowest annual level since the early 1970s, amid the Trump administration's sweeping clampdown on illegal immigration, internal federal statistics obtained by CBS News show.</p><p>U.S. Border Patrol agents recorded nearly 238,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border illegally in fiscal year 2025, which began in October of last year and ended on Sept. 30, according to the preliminary Department of Homeland Security data, which has not been previously reported.</p><p>The number is the lowest annual tally recorded by Border Patrol since fiscal year 1970, when the agency reported roughly 202,000 apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border, historical figures indicate.</p><p>It also represents a seismic change from the record-high levels of Border Patrol apprehensions recorded under the Biden administration, which faced an unprecedented humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. In fiscal year <span class="link">2022</span>, Border Patrol made 2.2 million apprehensions there — a record, and almost 10 times the levels recorded in 2025.</p><p>More than 60% of the apprehensions made by Border Patrol in fiscal year 2025 along the U.S.-Mexico border were recorded in the last full three months of the Biden administration, the preliminary data shows. Government fiscal years start in October and end in September, and some of them encompass different administrations.</p>
<p>Over President Trump's first full eight months in office, Border Patrol agents assigned to the southern border have recorded fewer than 9,000 apprehensions each month — a number that the agency recorded in 24-hour periods during some days under former President Joe Biden.</p><p>The internal DHS figures show Border Patrol made nearly 8,400 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border in September, an increase from 6,300 in August and 4,600 in July, a monthly record low.</p><p>Border Patrol apprehensions denote the number of times agents intercepted and processed migrants entering the country between official ports of entry, which is illegal. Some migrants can be counted multiple times, if they attempt to enter the U.S. more than once after being turned back to Mexico.</p><p>In a statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, "President Trump has overwhelmingly delivered on his promise to secure our Southern Border."</p>
<p>"As a result, Americans are safer — unvetted criminal illegal aliens and dangerous drugs are no longer pouring over our border unchecked," Jackson added. "And for all the Democrats who claimed it was impossible to secure the border or that they needed new policy, turns out all we needed was a new President."</p> <h2><strong>"A new normal"</strong></h2><p>Ariel Ruiz Soto, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, noted that illegal border crossings began to fall sharply in the summer of 2024, after the Biden administration enacted strict limits on asylum. But he said the Trump administration had set "a new normal" for migration flows in just a few months.</p><p>Ruiz Soto said the Trump administration's stringent policies — at the border and inside the U.S. — "have had a significant effect on people being deterred from coming illegally to the United States." </p><p>Soon <span class="link">after Mr. Trump took office</span> for a second time, his administration moved to seal and militarize the southern border, closing down the American <span class="link">asylum system</span> using emergency powers, <span class="link">dispatching thousands of soldiers</span> to repel illegal crossings and <span class="link">shutting down Biden-era programs</span> that allowed some migrants to enter the U.S. legally.</p><p>While parts of the asylum ban have been <span class="link">curtailed and declared illegal by courts</span>, the Trump administration has virtually ended the practice of releasing migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally, deporting them quickly or holding them in detention while their cases are reviewed. </p><p>Beyond the border, the Trump administration has staged <span class="link">highly publicized operations</span> targeting those living in the U.S. illegally, dispatching teams of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents across the country with the objective of overseeing a deportation campaign of unprecedented proportions. </p><p>The crackdown has not been without controversy. The administration's border policies have been denounced as inhumane, draconian and illegal by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which has challenged them in federal court on the grounds that they are at odds with U.S. and international asylum law as well as the Constitution.</p>
<p>The federal immigration raids well beyond the border have also triggered significant backlash, particularly in major American cities like <span class="link">Chicago</span> and Los Angeles, where large-scale protests have erupted. National and local Democrats have decried the raids as indiscriminate and overly harsh, accusing the Trump administration of not solely focusing on deporting violent offenders.</p><p>Citing confrontations and instances of violence, Mr. Trump in recent days has ordered National Guard troops to deploy to <span class="link">Chicago</span> and Portland, Oregon, to protect immigration agents and facilities there. A federal judge has so far blocked the plan to send National Guard units to Portland.  </p><p>Amid the national debate over immigration enforcement, those living along the southern border say there's no denying the reality on the ground has changed markedly.</p><p>John Martin said his network of shelters in the Texas border city of El Paso housed hundreds of migrants during spikes in illegal crossings during the Biden administration. On Monday, he said his organization was not housing a single migrant, saying he's received "little to no" new arrivals who are not local homeless residents in recent months. He attributed it to Mr. Trump's crackdown.</p><p>"If the goal is to decrease the number of individuals, I would say that appears to have been successful, without getting into the politics about whether or not I like it or dislike it," Martin said. "We're just simply not seeing the people."</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' lawyers want the hip-hop mogul sent to a low-security federal prison in New Jersey to serve his <span class="link">four-year, two-month prison sentence</span>, telling a judge Monday that the facility's drug treatment program will help him stay clean. </p><p>In a letter, Combs' lawyers urged the judge presiding over his case, Arun Subramanian, to "strongly recommend" that the federal Bureau of Prisons place Combs at FCI Fort Dix, a massive prison located on the grounds of the joint military base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.</p><p>FCI Fort Dix, one of several dozen federal prisons with a residential drug treatment program, will best allow Combs "to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts," Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos wrote. He also cited educational and occupational programs available at the prison, located about 70 miles south of New York City.</p><p>The request from Combs' attorney came after Subramanian asked his lawyers on Friday at the sentencing hearing to let him know their preference for a prison facility.</p><p>Also Monday, President Trump told reporters that Combs had asked him for a <span class="link">pardon</span>. Mr. Trump, referring to Combs by the nickname "Puff Daddy," did not say if he would grant the request. Messages seeking comment on Mr. Trump's remarks were left for Combs' lawyers and his publicity team by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Combs' sentencing for two prostitution-related charges capped a federal case that featured harrowing <span class="link">testimony about violence, drugs</span> and so-called "freak-offs," and exposed the sordid private life of <span class="link">one of the most influential figures in music</span>.</p><p>While the criminal case against Combs came to an end, he still faces <span class="link">civil lawsuits</span>, including from <span class="link">a former stylist</span> who accused Combs of sexually, physically and emotionally abusing him while he was working for Combs and his label, Bad Boy Entertainment — allegations that Combs has denied, with his legal team calling them "falsehoods." </p><p>Deonte' Nash alleged he was frightened throughout his roughly decade-long experience working for the music mogul. The 39-year-old stylist claims Combs choked him multiple times, describing one alleged incident that occurred after he went to a restaurant with R&amp;B singer <span class="link">Cassie Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend whose testimony</span> was critical in his conviction.</p><p>The "I'll Be Missing You" singer was convicted in July under the federal <span class="link">Mann Act</span>, which bans transporting people across state lines for any sexual crime. His trial ended in a split verdict, with acquittals on sex trafficking and racketeering charges that could have put him behind bars for life.</p>
<p>Combs has been locked up at a federal jail in Brooklyn, <span class="link">the Metropolitan Detention Center</span>, since his September 2024 arrest. His time there will be subtracted from his sentence, meaning he could get out in about three years.</p><p>In a letter to Subramanian on the eve of sentencing, Combs said he has gone through a "spiritual reset" in jail and is "committed to the journey of remaining a drug free, non-violent and peaceful person."</p><p>"I thank God that I'm stronger, wiser, clean, clear and sober," he wrote.</p><p>Subramanian has not yet acted on the request to recommend placement at FCI Fort Dix.</p><p>Judges often make recommendations about where inmates should serve time, but it's up to the Bureau of Prisons to decide. Those decisions, the agency has said, are based on a variety of factors, including the severity of the offense, the required security level and an inmate's programming needs.</p><p>FCI Fort Dix, the largest single federal prison by population with just under 3,900 inmates, is about 64 miles southwest of New York City, where Combs was born and rose to fame as a rapper and entrepreneur in an array of businesses, including fashion, television and liquor. An adjacent minimum-security prison camp has 210 inmates.</p><p>Combs once owned a home in New Jersey, selling it nearly a decade ago.</p>
<p>His primary residence, according to court papers, has been a $48 million mansion on an island near Miami. That home and a mansion he owns in Los Angeles were raided by federal agents last year during the investigation that led to his arrest.</p><p>FCI Fort Dix has been home to a number of high-profile inmates over the years, including reputed mobsters, drug traffickers, corrupt politicians and <span class="link">Martin Shkreli</span>. For a time, it was run by the warden who had been in charge of a Manhattan federal jail when financier <span class="link">Jeffrey Epstein</span> killed himself at the jail in 2019. That warden, Lamine N'Diaye, has since retired.</p><p>In 2021, a 27-year-old Fort Dix inmate was stabbed in the eyeball by a fellow prisoner.</p><p>In 2019, a Fort Dix inmate, a former inmate and two other people were arrested for using a drone to smuggle in contraband including cellphones, tobacco, weight-loss supplements and eyeglasses. The same year, a Fort Dix correctional officer pleaded guilty in a separate case to pocketing bribes to smuggle in contraband.</p><p>During his time at Fort Dix, Shkreli ended up in solitary confinement amid allegations he was using a contraband smartphone to run his drug company from behind bars. Inmates are forbidden from conducting business and possessing cellphones.</p>

<div class="article-title">FBI analyzed some Republican lawmakers' phone records as part of Trump Jan. 6 probe</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The FBI analyzed the phone records of more than a half dozen Republican lawmakers as part of an investigation into efforts by President Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to information released Monday by GOP senators. </p><p>The records, which the FBI analyzed in 2023, enabled investigators to see basic information about the date and time of phone calls but not the content of the communications, the senators said. The data encompassed several days during the week of Jan. 6, 2021, when pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to halt the certification of the election results. </p><p>A document dated Sept. 27, 2023, lists nine Republican lawmakers whose records were allegedly scrutinized: Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania. </p><p>The disclosure adds new detail to the since-shuttered investigation by the FBI and former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith into the steps Mr. Trump took in the run-up to the Capitol riot to undo his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Mr. Trump <span class="link">was indicted in August 2023</span> with conspiring to overturn the results, but <span class="link">the case was abandoned</span> after Mr. Trump's win the following year because of a Justice Department legal opinion that states sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution. </p><p>The subpoena for the phone records was disclosed by several Republican senators, including Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee that oversees the FBI. Grassley said the Sept. 27, 2023, document memorializing the "preliminary toll analysis" was found in response to his request. The investigative step was authorized by a grand jury, the senators said.</p>
<p>Grassley called it a "violation of personal property and people's rights and the law and their constitutional rights."</p><p>The document suggests the analysis was conducted by an FBI special agent whose name was redacted, and it was authorized by two supervisory agents. It does not say how or why those lawmakers were identified or whether any meaningful tips or leads emerged from that investigative work.</p><p>Some of the lawmakers were part of a group of Republicans who planned to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election. After the voting was disrupted by the rioters on Jan. 6, 2021, most of the lawmakers named in the FBI document voted to certify the results, while Sen. Lummis and Rep. Kelly objected to at least one state.</p><p>The special counsel's investigation delved into phone calls between lawmakers and the president on the evening of Jan. 6, 2021, which Smith alleged were part of a last-ditch attempt to talk congressional Republicans into blocking the certification of Biden's victory. The 2023 indictment against Mr. Trump lists several attempts by Mr. Trump and his alleged co-conspirators to reach senators and representatives by phone. It argued the president "attempted to exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol by calling lawmakers to convince them, based on knowingly false claims of election fraud, to delay the certification."</p>
<p>Last year, a final report penned by Smith — which <span class="link">argued</span> the president would have been convicted if not for his 2024 election win — also pointed to phone calls placed by Mr. Trump and members of his circle. It cited toll records from two unindicted co-conspirators who are unnamed <span class="link">but are widely believed</span> to be Rudy Giuliani and one other person. </p><p>The senators said they would not be conducting their own investigation because they expected FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino — both Trump loyalists — to review the matter. Grassley suggested that more people at the FBI would be fired over the investigation, saying, "If heads don't roll in this town, nothing changes."</p><p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on social media that he had "grave concerns" about the incident.</p><p>"I fully support Senate committees getting to the bottom of this outrageous abuse of power and weaponization of the government," said Thune, a South Dakota Republican.</p><p>CBS News has reached out to theSenate Judicary Committee's Democratic side and to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for comment.</p><p>The Trump administration has taken aim at Smith's investigation since returning to office. The Justice Department has <span class="link">fired staff members who worked for Smith</span>, and a government body <span class="link">launched an investigation into Smith</span> for allegedly engaging in illegal political activity while on the job — allegations <span class="link">Smith's lawyers called</span> "imaginary and unfounded." </p>

<div class="article-title">Bill Nye warns U.S. could "cede leadership to other countries" if NASA budget is cut</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Bill Nye and hundreds of others gathered at Capitol Hill on Monday to protest against the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to NASA, arguing that Congress has an obligation to promote the progress of science. </p><p>"The United States would cede leadership to other countries, especially [the] China National Space Administration," if funding to NASA Science is cut, Nye said. In an interview on "The Takeout" following the protest, Nye argued NASA's budget is just "a sliver of the pie" of the nearly $1.7 trillion federal budget.</p><p>"It's barely the width of the pie cutter, it's less than 0.1% of the federal budget and the return is extraordinary," he told CBS News' Major Garrett. </p><p>A White House budget proposal issued earlier this year would see NASA's funding cut by about 25% for fiscal year 2026, from about $24 billion to $18.8 billion.</p><p>Nye, the CEO of Planetary Society and former host of "Bill Nye the Science Guy," and around 300 space advocates said Monday that dozens of missions would be at risk — including NASA's Perseverance Mars rover and the Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time in half a century — if the cuts are approved by Congress.</p>
<p>Despite the proposed cuts, NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, said last month <span class="link">as he introduced a new class of 10 NASA astronaut candidates</span> that there's a possibility one of them could be among the first Americans to put their boots on Mars. However, flights are not yet on the drawing board, and most experts say no such NASA mission is likely to launch within the next decade, and probably longer.</p><p>Duffy also said he was confident the U.S. would beat China and win the second space race back to the moon.</p><p>Referring to the recent news of Mars rover Perseverance uncovering <span class="link">rocks that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life</span>, Nye said a NASA budget cut would put the U.S. behind as China plans to launch its sample-return mission in 2028, possibly bringing back samples in 2033.</p><p>"Everybody, understand that if we were to find evidence of life on another world, it would change the course of human history," he added. "So you say, 'Well, how much does that cost?' We're not sure. We've never done it." </p>
<p>The 69-year-old science advocate said investing in NASA is "priceless," telling Garrett: "NASA also, objectively, every dollar that goes into NASA Science comes back at least a factor of three times, so if you put $1 into NASA Science, you're going to get $3 back into the economy."</p><p>"Global positioning, situational awareness ... digital cameras, mobile phones — everything is a result of exploring the cosmos," Nye added. </p>

<div class="article-title">Trump administration mulling $10 billion aid package for farmers, sources say</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington</em> — The Trump administration is considering a significant financial aid package for farmers, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions. The package could include more than $10 billion in relief.</p><p>The White House is focusing on soybean farmers, since they've been hard hit by the Chinese boycott on American soybeans. Discussions about the package are still in early stages, one of the sources said. </p><p>The Treasury Department and Agriculture Department are involved in the talks. Top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on CNBC on Monday that "we've had numerous meetings over the last week or two" about "what we're going to do" about the hit farmers have taken. He promised the administration would take "big measures" and "those big measures are going to be public really, really soon."</p><p>Hassett acknowledged, "Right now, the silos are full, and there are soybeans sitting on the ground with tarps over them. That's unacceptable to the president." He also said the administration is "calling up all our soybean customers around the world as part of our trade negotiations."</p><p>In 2024, China <span class="link">purchased</span> $12.6 billion worth of soybeans from the U.S., federal data from the Agriculture Department shows.</p>
<p>As harvest season gets underway this year, China has made no U.S. soybean purchases.</p><p>Last month, President Trump suggested some financial aid for <span class="link">farmers</span> could come from <span class="link">tariff</span> revenue. The Treasury Department says the federal government has collected roughly $215 billion in tariffs in the 2025 fiscal year, which began in October 2024 and ended Sept. 30. </p><p>"We're going to take some of that tariff money that we made, we're going to give it to our farmers, who are, for a little while, going to be hurt until the tariffs kick into their benefit," the president told reporters in the Oval Office on Sept. 25. "So, we're going to make sure that our farmers are in great shape, because we're taking in a lot of money."</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>

<div class="article-title">Air traffic controllers told to keep working during shutdown</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The union representing the nation's air traffic controllers is directing its members to keep working during the U.S. government shutdown now stretching <span class="link">into its second week</span>, with the labor group warning that failure to report for duty could lead to termination. </p><p>The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) told members Monday that it discourages federal employees from taking any actions to compromise air safety. The group represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers, engineers and professionals in aviation safety-related roles. </p><p>"Air traffic controllers and other aviation safety professionals take their responsibility to protect the safety of the flying public very seriously. Participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service," NATCA said in a message to members posted in part on the group's website. "It is not only illegal, but it also undermines NATCA's credibility and severely weakens our ability to effectively advocate for you and your families."</p><h2>Sick calls edge up</h2><p>The union's warning came as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey that TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers <span class="link">calling in sick</span> since the shutdown began last week. </p><p>"We're tracking sick calls, sick leave. And have we had a slight tick up in sick calls? Yes," he told reporters. "You'll see delays come from that. ... Our priorities are safety, and so if we have additional calls, we will reduce the flow consistent with a rate that's safe for the American people." </p>
<p>Duffy also acknowledged the potential effect on worker morale of being required to work without pay.</p><p>"They have bills," he said. "So now they're thinking about that at the same time that they're controlling the airspace, which I don't like that. … We want them to leave their personal problems at the door when they go into a tower or into a facility." </p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration defines air traffic controllers as <span class="link">essential workers</span>, requiring them to stay on the job during government closures despite going unpaid. Essential employees required to continue working during a shutdown are guaranteed back pay once the stalemate ends and lawmakers restore government funding.</p><p>"We cannot stress enough that it is essential to avoid any actions that could reflect poorly on you, our Union, or our professions," NATCA said in the message to workers. <strong>"</strong>We urge you to stand in solidarity with your brothers and sisters by continuing to exhibit the same unwavering professionalism that the aviation community and the American people deserve."</p>
<h2>"Uncertainty and hardships"</h2><p>In a video message on TikTok, NATCA President Nick Daniels also noted that the government shutdown "creates uncertainty and hardships for our members."</p><p>NATCA didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p>TSA officers are also deemed essential essential workers under federal rules and must continue reporting to work during the lapse in federal funding. During previous shutdowns, being forced to work without pay has led to a <span class="link">rise in worker absences</span> and some leaving government service, according to former TSA officials. </p><p>During the <span class="link">34-day government shutdown</span> from December of 2018 to January of 2019, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick, <span class="link">according to the agency</span>, leading to delays in security screenings at major airports across the U.S.  </p><p>More recently, a <span class="link">nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers</span> has led to delays at airports across the U.S. According to a CBS News review, <span class="link">more than 90%</span> of air traffic control towers across the country are understaffed (Visit fly.faa.gov for real-time information on any flight impacts at U.S. airports because of staffing, weather or other factors.)</p><p>As the impasse in Congress continues, the Senate is expected to hold procedural votes again on Monday night on dueling measures to fund the government and end the shutdown.</p>

<div class="article-title">Ex-NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez charged with felony over violent altercation</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Former NFL quarterback <span class="link">Mark Sanchez</span> was charged with a felony over a violent altercation in Indianapolis over the weekend, officials announced Monday. </p><p>Sanchez was charged with battery involving serious bodily injury, a felony, Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears told reporters. If convicted, Sanchez would face a sentence ranging between one and six years, Mears said.</p><p>Sanchez, who has been an NFL game analyst for Fox Sports since 2021, was hospitalized with multiple stab wounds following the altercation early Saturday morning. The Marion County Sheriff's Office told CBS News that Sanchez was processed at the hospital, where he was receiving treatment, and has since paid bond. An initial court hearing for Sanchez scheduled for Tuesday was canceled, and the next hearing has been scheduled for Nov. 5, according to online court records.</p><p>The incident stemmed from what Mears described as a dispute over where a man was parked.</p><p>"This was a situation that did not need to occur," Mears said. "The allegations involve a 38-year-old man becoming involved in an altercation with a 69-year-old man who sustained significant and very severe injuries."</p>
<p>Mears said the investigation was still in its early stages and additional charges could be filed.</p><p>Sanchez also faces several misdemeanor charges, including battery resulting in injury, public intoxication and unlawful entry of a vehicle, authorities said in a statement.</p><p>"This has been a deeply distressing time for everyone involved," Nick Sanchez, Mark's brother, said Monday in a statement on behalf of the family.</p><p>"Mark and our family are incredibly grateful for the concern, love, and support we've received over the past few days," Nick Sanchez said. "Mark remains under medical care for the serious injuries he sustained and is focused on his recovery as the legal process continues. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the first responders and medical staff." </p>
<p>The other man involved in the altercation works for Restaurant Technologies, a Minnesota-based company that recycles and disposes of commercial cooking oil, according to the company and court documents. The man, identified in an affidavit for probable cause as P.T., was in a truck in an alley that was backed into a loading dock area for a Westin hotel when the incident unfolded.</p><p>P.T. later told police that Sanchez had said he couldn't be at the loading dock, according to the affidavit. He initially thought that Sanchez could be the hotel's manager because he was well-dressed, the court document said. When P.T. leaned closer to Sanchez to try to hear him better because he wasn't wearing his hearing aids, he told police that Sanchez allegedly smelled of alcohol and his speech was slurred. </p><p>When P.T. said he tried to get his cellphone from the truck to call his manager, Sanchez allegedly blocked him, according to the affidavit. He then tried to get into the truck on the passenger side, but Sanchez allegedly blocked him there, too. When P.T. tried again to get in on the driver's side, Sanchez allegedly shoved him, the court document said.</p><p>P.T. said he sprayed Sanchez with pepper spray in the face, according to the affidavit. Sanchez wiped his face and then allegedly advanced toward the man, the document continued.</p><p>"This guy is trying to kill me," P.T. told police what he thought at the time.</p><p>He said he pulled out a knife and stabbed Sanchez two or three times when Sanchez allegedly came at him, the court document said. P.T. told police he flew into a dumpster and fell on some pallets on the ground.</p><p>"While he was on the ground, P.T. was not aware of what Mr. Sanchez was physically doing to him, whether he was punching him or otherwise striking him," the affidavit states. "While P.T. was on the ground, he could only see the feet of Mr. Sanchez coming at him, making P. T. realize that he was in a life-or-death situation."</p>
<p>He told police he scrambled to his feet and stabbed Sanchez once more.</p><p>P.T. recalled to police that Sanchez looked shocked as he slowly turned around and took off, according to the affidavit. </p><p>The document stated that the man suffered a severe laceration to the side of his face.</p><p>Sanchez's agent, Andrew Kessler, had previously told CBS News that Sanchez was in stable condition and recovering in a hospital.</p>

<div class="article-title">Foreclosures are surging as U.S. homeowners grapple with rising costs</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Kimberly Draxler was in shock when she called her mortgage lender in April and was told her four-bedroom home in Hillview, Kentucky, would be sold out from under her in a matter of days. </p><p>Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home. </p><p>"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me," Draxler told CBS News. </p><p>Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules. </p><p>Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.</p>
<p>The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and <span class="link">groceries</span> to <span class="link">energy bills</span> and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.</p><h2>"I just couldn't do it anymore"</h2><p>Although foreclosures — which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions — remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, they are on the rise.</p><p>As of August, foreclosure filings had risen six straights months year-over-year and were up 18% from the same period in 2025, according to property data firm ATTOM. Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.</p><p>"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills — I just couldn't do it anymore," said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade. </p><pre> </pre><p>Roughly 94% of mortgage defaults occur after a homeowner loses income to extenuating circumstances, according to The Urban Institute, citing data from the National Bureau of Economic Research.</p>
<h2>Rising homeownership costs</h2><p>A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of <span class="link">$2,370 a year for property coverage</span> — up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology. </p><p>In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates. </p><p>"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages," Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.</p><p>Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent <span class="link">slowdown in hiring</span> as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.</p><p>A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated. </p><h2>A narrow escape</h2><p>More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. "While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases."</p><p>As for Draxler, she managed to keep her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows debtors to hold onto their property and pay off debt over time, usually within three to five years. But coming so close to losing her home of more than 30 years continues to weigh on her.</p>
<p>"I did not want to lose my house," Draxler said. "I wouldn't have no place to go."</p>

<section class="content__body">
<p>Costco customers can now buy Ozempic and Wegovy at the discount chain's drugstores.</p><p>Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical firm that makes the weight-loss drugs, announced Friday that Ozempic and Wegovy are available at Costco pharmacies across the U.S. A one-month supply of the drugs at the retailer will run $499, the same price they are listed for on Novo Nordisk's direct-to-consumer website, as well as at CVS and Walmart. </p><p>Ozempic and Wegovy typically retail for around $1,300 and $1,600, respectively, according to GoodRx, which compares drug prices from different pharmacies.</p><p>Costco executive members and Costco Citibank Visa card holders also receive an additional 2% discount on Ozempic and Wegovy, a Novo Nordisk  spokesperson told CBS News in an email. Members of the discount chain will still require a prescription to obtain the weight-loss drugs. </p><p>"Our collaboration with Costco is another step forward by Novo Nordisk in making real Wegovy® and Ozempic easier to access and afford — right where people already shop," Dave Moore, executive vice president for Novo Nordisk's U.S. Operations, said in a statement.</p>

Ozempic is designed for adults with Type 2 diabetes and helps adults lower blood sugar. It also has been shown to reduce heart and kidney problems. </p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said last year that Wegovy, which unlike Ozempic has been FDA-approved for weight loss, could be used to reduce the risk of heart attacks and heart strokes in certain patients.</p>

<div class="article-title">Social Security administrator is named to the newly created position of IRS CEO</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>WASHINGTON — Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano was named to the newly created position of CEO of the IRS on Monday, making him the latest member of the Trump administration to be put in charge of multiple federal agencies.</p> <p>As IRS CEO, Bisignano will report to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who currently serves as acting commissioner of the IRS, the Treasury Department says. It is unclear whether Bisignano's newly created role at the IRS will require Senate confirmation.</p> <p>The Treasury Department said in a statement that Bisignano will be responsible for overseeing all day-to-day IRS operations while also continuing to serve in his role as commissioner of the Social Security Administration.</p>
<p>Bessent said in a statement that the IRS and SSA "share many of the same technological and customer service goals. This makes Mr. Bisignano a natural choice for this role."</p> <p>The move to install Bisignano at the IRS adds another layer to the leadership shuffling that has occurred at the agency since the beginning of Trump's term. Bessent was named acting commissioner in August after Trump removed former U.S. Rep Billy Long from the role less than two months after his confirmation, and nominated him as ambassador to Iceland.</p>
<p>The four acting commissioners who preceded Long in the job included one who resigned over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants' tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and another whose appointment led to a fight between former Trump adviser Elon Musk and Bessent.</p> <p>Mike Kaercher, deputy director of the Tax Law Center at the New York University School of Law, points to a possible conflict of interest in Bisignano holding leadership roles at SSA and the IRS. "Putting the same person in charge of both the IRS and SSA creates a conflict of interest when SSA wants access to legally protected taxpayer data," Kaercher said.</p>
<p>With two day jobs, Bisignano joins a number of other Trump administration officials to wear multiple hats, including Bessent, Marco Rubio, Sean Duffy, Jamieson Greer and Russell Vought.</p> <p>IRS and Social Security advocates expressed concern about the new appointment.</p> <p>Kathleen Romig, director of Social Security and Disability Policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, pointed to Bisignano being named to a position that appears to avoid congressional approval.</p> <p>"If the Trump Admin asked for the Senate's advice &amp; consent, would they really want the same person running the government's biggest program AND overseeing the implementation of the extraordinarily complex new tax law?" she said on the Bluesky social media app.</p> <p>And Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for SSA recipients and future retirees, said Bisignano's "divided attention will create a bottleneck that makes the inevitable problems that arise even harder to correct. Never in Social Security's 90-year history has a commissioner held a second job. Bisiginano's new role will leave a leadership vacuum at the top of the agency, especially since the Republican Senate hasn't even confirmed a deputy commissioner."</p> <p>Bisignano has served as CEO of Fiserv, a payments and financial services tech firm, since 2020. He is a onetime defender of corporate policies to protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination.</p>

<div class="article-title">Who is Larry Ellison, the billionaire Trump friend who's part of the TikTok takeover?</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Larry Ellison has a lower profile than other tech billionaires, but his influence over media is about to be immense. His family's empire could soon own CBS, Paramount, CNN and TikTok.</p>
</div>
<div aria-label="Transcript" class="transcript storytext">
<b class="icn-story-transcript-wrap">
</b>
<p>MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: </p><p> Tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his family are poised to establish a media dynasty. In the past few months, Ellison and his son, David, have taken control of CBS News. President Trump tapped them to run TikTok, and they're set to make a bid for CNN's parent company. NPR's Bobby Allyn looks at Larry Ellison's rise from cloud storage exec to soon-to-be media mogul.</p><p>BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Oracle is one of those tech companies that people often wonder, what exactly do they do again? Just ask George Polisner. He's a former Oracle executive.</p><p>GEORGE POLISNER: Earlier in my career, when I would tell people I was working for Oracle, they would go, oh, you know, the toothbrush company. And I would say, you know, not Oral-B, Oracle (laughter).</p><p>ALLYN: Oracle's not in the toothbrush business, but to some, it's about just as exciting. They run the back end of the internet, hosting massive amounts of data in the cloud, helping governments, militaries, hospitals and private companies make sense of the data. The data-hungry AI era has meant big business for Oracle. Here's Larry Ellison talking to investors last year.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: You say, I really want to use AI. I want to take full advantage of AI. Well, you can't do it unless you get your data in order.</p><p>ALLYN: Since the AI boom, Oracle has seen its stock price more than double. That has sent the personal wealth of Larry Ellison soaring. He briefly knocked Elon Musk off the top spot as the world's richest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which adds to his showy and flamboyant nature. Ellison, who is 81, owns nearly an entire Hawaiian island. He's a competitive yacht racer, and he owns a fighter jet. Former Oracle executive Polisner says Ellison was like this even before he became a confidant of President Trump.</p><p>POLISNER: I think Larry is an iconoclast. He's always been known as a swashbuckling visionary in many respects. He has, I think, an incredible appetite for access to power.</p><p>ALLYN: After November 2020, court records show Ellison was on a call with Trump supporters, sharing ideas about how to undermine the result of the election. From that point on, Ellison has gotten closer and closer with Trump, which has helped win government approval for the Ellisons of Paramount Global, gave Oracle a leg up in the TikTok deal and they hope gives them an advantage in a future bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. Michael Socolow, a media historian at the University of Maine, says controlling a dominant social media platform and a television network could give the Ellisons even more sway than the Murdoch family.</p><p>MICHAEL SOCOLOW: The potential to persuade Americans if you own CBS News, TikTok and CNN at one point is incredible, and I think it's historically unprecedented.</p><p>ALLYN: Now the question is, when the deals are done, will Larry Ellison and his son, David, move CBS, CNN and TikTok to the right? Analysts I spoke to say, it's possible, but it'll be balanced against not alienating each media company's existing audience. What's unquestionable, though, is that those deals are a big data play, says former Oracle executive Polisner.</p><p>POLISNER: He may be looking primarily at the value of the data and advertising revenue from harvesting that data.</p><p>ALLYN: The Ellisons didn't return requests for comment but in remarks to investors last year, Larry Ellison fantasized about a society in which all things are under surveillance at all times and that Oracle would be the steward of all the data.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>ELLISON: The police will be on their best behavior because we're constantly watching and recording everything that's going on. Citizens will be on their best behavior because we're constantly recording and reporting everything that's going on.</p><p>ALLYN: The Ellison family's expected hold on media and entertainment data has drawn comparisons to how Vanderbilts owned railroads and the Rockefellers controlled standard oil. But in the attention economy, that digital data could be even more valuable than railroads and oil.</p><p>Bobby Allyn, NPR News.</p>

<div class="article-title">Psychiatrists call for RFK Jr. to be replaced as health secretary</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Psychiatrists have joined other public health groups in calling for the removal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary.</p> <p>Two psychiatry organizations — the Southern California Psychiatry Society and the recently formed grassroots Committee to Protect Public Mental Health — have released statements saying that the actions of the leader of the Department of Health and Human Services have increased stigma, instilled fear and hurt access to mental health and addiction care.</p> <p>"As physicians committed to evidence-based care, we are alarmed by the direction of HHS under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr," the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health said in a statement.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">HHS responds</h3> <p>"Secretary Kennedy remains firmly committed to delivering on President Trump's promise to Make America Healthy Again by dismantling the failed status quo, restoring public trust in health institutions, and ensuring the transparency, accountability, and decision-making power the American people voted for," Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the federal health department, wrote to NPR in an email.</p> <p>The Southern California Psychiatry Society represents more than a 1,000 clinicians; the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health has just over 50 members. </p> <p>In recent years, the federal government had taken a leading role in funding efforts to address serious mental illness and substance use through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administrations (SAMHSA), notes Dr. Steven Sharfstein, a past-president of the American Psychiatric Association and an adjunct professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University.</p> <p>Those efforts had started to pay off, he adds. "There's been great progress in reducing the number of overdose deaths in the country as a result of these initiatives," he says.</p> <p>But the firing of staff at SAMHSA earlier this year, and the Health Secretary's efforts to shutter the agency, have hurt those efforts, says Sharfstein, who's also a founding member of the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health.</p>
<p>"RFK Jr. is trying to eliminate the federal agency that is responsible for supporting states and localities with overdose prevention," says Dr. Eric Rafla-Yuan, a San Diego-based psychiatrist and a member of the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health. "This is exactly opposite of the direction that we need to be going."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Psychiatric medications questioned</h3> <p>Both the organizations are also concerned about the health secretary's attacks on psychiatric medications, including in the Make Our Children Healthy Again strategy, which is also known as The MAHA report</p>
<p>The MAHA report "specifically misrepresents the data on psychotropic medications, really ignoring the full body of the scientific literature," says Dr. Emily Wood, co-chair of the Southern California Psychiatric Association. "And it is calling for various ways to limit access to psychiatric medications, which is extremely disturbing as these are medications that are critical for many individuals with depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, ADHD and many disorders."</p> <p>"This misrepresentation increases stigma, spreads fear, and can keep people from reaching out for help when they need it most," according to the statement by the Southern California Psychiatric Association. "The report uses these inaccurate statements as a basis for taking action to restrict access to critical services that ease suffering, restore functioning, and prevent suicide."</p>
<p>Dr. Sharfstein says he's also concerned about the impact of cuts to Medicaid on people with Serious Mental Illness (SMIs), which includes conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, nearly 6% of American adults live with an SMI. Given the debilitating nature of SMIs, patients tend to be poor, explains Sharfstein.</p> <p>"They can't afford the medications," he says, "And Medicaid is what they rely on. But it's not just medications. It's outpatient treatment. It's access to acute inpatient care."</p> <p>As cuts to Medicaid roll out, access to care for mental illness and addiction will get increasingly "compromised," says Sharfstein. "And we'll see a kind of rolling crisis occur."</p> <p>His group is calling on lawmakers to replace Kennedy with someone trained in public health and evidence-based care. "To protect patients, safeguard scientific integrity, and restore public trust, we join our colleagues in calling on the President to remove Secretary Kennedy and appoint a qualified, evidence-driven leader without delay," according to the statement.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Who is Bari Weiss? CBS News' new editor-in-chief is a vocal critic of legacy media</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Paramount announced Monday that it is acquiring The Free Press — a provocative news site known for criticizing mainstream media and left-leaning "woke" culture — and installing the publication's co-founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News.</p> <p>"As of today, I am editor-in-chief of CBS News, working with new colleagues on the programs that have impacted American culture for generations — shows like <em>60 Minutes</em> and <em>Sunday Morning</em> — and shaping how millions of Americans read, listen, watch, and, most importantly, understand the news in the 21st century," Weiss wrote in a Monday letter to readers.</p> <p>It's a significant step in the meteoric rise of the 41-year-old journalist and entrepreneur, who spent years as an op-ed editor at the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>and <em>New York Times</em> before her emphatic disavowal of traditional media organizations.</p>
<p>Weiss left the <em>Times </em>in 2020 after many in the newsroom expressed outrage over its publication of a controversial op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, in which he called for a military response to protests over George Floyd's murder. In a lengthy resignation letter, Weiss accused her colleagues of harassment and argued that the <em>Times</em> was too influenced by its left-leaning critics online.</p> <p>Weiss, along with her sister Suzy Weiss and her spouse Nellie Bowles, started The Free Press as a newsletter (originally titled Common Sense) the following year, calling it a "new media company … built on the ideals that once were the bedrock of great American journalism: honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence."</p> <p>The Free Press developed into a full-fledged media company in 2022, expanding its offerings into podcasts and live events. Its investigations and commentaries largely scrutinize political and cultural issues like gender-affirming health care, COVID-19 lockdowns, DEI programs and J.K. Rowling's anti-trans views.</p> <p>It's where then-NPR editor Uri Berliner published his essay arguing the public radio network had lost America's trust (he joined The Free Press as a senior editor mere months later). The publication, like Weiss herself, is also known for its staunchly pro-Israel views, especially in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and Israel's ensuing war in Gaza.</p>
<p>The Free Press has built a sizable following. It has grown its subscriber base by 86% over the past year to a total of 1.5 million people, according to Paramount, and is backed by a slew of big names, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, hedge fund tycoon Paul Marshall and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.</p>
<p>"As proud as we are of the 1.5 million subscribers who have joined under the banner of The Free Press — and we are astonished at that number — this is a country with 340 million people. We want our work to reach more of them, as quickly as possible," Weiss wrote on Monday. "This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows us to do that."</p> <p>The Free Press says it will retain its own brand and operations. And, as NPR has reported, Weiss — who has no broadcasting experience — appears unlikely to run the news division at CBS News on a day-to-day basis.</p> <p>But she will play a key role in shaping the network's editorial direction, at a time when it is looking to expand its appeal among right-leaning viewers. When Skydance Media acquired Paramount, CBS' parent company, in July — a merger that required Trump administration approval — it promised to embrace a diversity of political and ideological viewpoints.</p> <p>"Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News," Skydance Media CEO David Ellison said in a statement, calling the move "part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects … to audiences around the world."</p> <p>Here's what else to know about Weiss.</p> <h3 class="edTag">What is Weiss' background? </h3> <p>Weiss grew up in a Jewish family in Pittsburgh and had her Bat Mitzvah at the Tree of Life Synagogue — long before the 2018 mass shooting that made it the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Weiss attended Columbia University (where, she says, she dated future <em>Saturday Night Live</em> star Kate McKinnon). As a sophomore, Weiss was part of a group of Jewish students who challenged the university to respond to what they perceived as anti-Israel intellectual intimidation in its Mideast studies department.</p> <p>While a university panel ultimately concluded there was no ongoing problem in the department, the incident gained national prominence and prompted Columbia to revise its process for reviewing complaints against faculty.</p>
<p>It was also a formative experience for Weiss, who became the founding editor of a campus magazine dedicated to politics, culture and Jewish affairs — and went on to write a book called <em>How to Fight Anti-Semitism</em>, which was published in 2019.</p> <p>After college, Weiss worked as a senior editor at the online Jewish life magazine Tablet before joining the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2013 as an op-ed and book review editor. She left in 2017, after President Trump took office. She later told Reason that she left the job in part because of her employer's resistance to political op-eds that were "too anti-Trump."</p>
<p>"It was heartbreaking for me to see people who I thought that we sort of shared fundamental values making peace with a candidate who, I mean, just from the most basic perspective ran a campaign on denigrating and demonizing the weakest people in our culture," Weiss told the magazine.</p> <p>The <em>New York Times</em> hired Weiss as a staff editor and writer in the opinion section in 2017, as part of its stated efforts to broaden ideological diversity in its op-ed pages, then led by James Bennet.</p> <p>"I've gone in the last year from being the most progressive person at <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, to being the most right-winged person at <em>The New York Times</em>," Weiss told the <em>Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle</em> later that year.</p>
<p>Many of Weiss' <em>Times </em>columns garnered controversy — like a 2017 defense of cultural appropriation, a 2018 defense of comedian Aziz Ansari after he faced #MeToo accusations, a piece questioning whether sexual assault allegations against then-Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh should be disqualifying and a 2018 attack on liberal intolerance titled "We're All Fascists Now."</p> <p>But the biggest backlash came in June 2020, after the <em>Times</em> ran the op-ed by Cotton — the Republican senator — calling for the military to respond to Black Lives Matter protests with an "overwhelming show of force." Hundreds of <em>Times</em> staffers signed a letter protesting the piece, which an editor's note later said "fell short of our standards and should not have been published." Bennet resigned within days.</p> <p>Weiss, who defended the op-ed's publication, tweeted about the fallout as a "civil war inside The New York Times between the (mostly young wokes) [and] the (mostly 40+) liberals" — a characterization that many of her colleagues pushed back on. In July 2020, Weiss resigned in a nearly 1,500-word letter to the paper's publisher, citing "bullying by colleagues" and an "illiberal environment."</p> <p>"The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people," she wrote. "Nowadays, standing up for principle at the paper does not win plaudits. It puts a target on your back."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">How does Weiss identify politically? </h3> <p>The Free Press frames its coverage as anti-woke and has made its name by criticizing mainstream institutions and experts in industries from media to public health. But it has been relatively measured in its view of the Trump administration, occasionally publishing critical pieces and most recently objecting to its "coercion" of ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show.</p> <p>Even as Weiss has made a name for herself in part by lambasting progressive culture, her own political views have been somewhat hard to pin down.</p>
<p>Over the years, she has described herself as a "radical centrist" and a "Jewish, center-left-on-most-things-person." In a 2024 TED Talk, she said she voted for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in one election, and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in others.</p>
<p>She went on to characterize her ideological views as pro-choice, pro-Israel and pro-gay marriage, "so much so that I'm actually in one myself." (Weiss married Bowles, a former <em>Times</em> tech reporter, in 2021 — the same year they cofounded The Free Press — and they have two children together.)</p> <p>But she also acknowledged that she is a frequent target of criticism from fellow liberals.</p> <p>"I am, or at least … I used to be, considered a standard-issue liberal," Weiss said in the same speech. "And yet somehow, in our most intellectual and prestigious spaces, many of the ideas I just outlined and others like them, have become provocative or controversial, which is really a polite way of saying unwelcome, beyond the pale, even bigoted or racist."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Why is she returning to legacy media? </h3> <p>In Weiss' announcement letter, she acknowledges that many people may be wondering: "Why flee <em>The New York Times</em> only to head back into another legacy institution?"</p> <p>She says that while she was "raised to be a believer in the institutions that built America and that made sense of it," she found in 2020 that "the most important public conversations were happening outside of those places."</p>
<p>Things look different five years later, Weiss writes, "as the gatekeepers of the mainstream have failed one after another" and new voices — including podcasters and influencers — have come to dominate the media landscape.</p> <p>Weiss paints a picture of two increasingly powerful extremes — "an America-loathing far left" and a "history-erasing far right" — and says the majority of "smart, politically mixed, pragmatic Americans" who fall somewhere in between are not being well served. She pitches Paramount's embrace of The Free Press as a way to change that.</p>
<p>"The values that we've hammered out here over the years — journalism based in curiosity and honesty, a culture of healthy disagreement, our shared belief in America's promise — now have the opportunity to go very, very big," Weiss writes.</p> <p>In a note to CBS News staffers obtained by Axios on Monday, Weiss laid out the 10 principles that she says have and will continue to guide her journalism.</p> <p>Those include holding "both American political parties to equal scrutiny," embracing "a wide spectrum of views and voices so that the audience can contend with the best arguments on all sides of a debate" and respecting "our audience enough to tell the truth plainly — wherever it leads."</p>

<div class="article-title">ICC finds former Sudan militia leader guilty of war crimes in Darfur</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>LAGOS, Nigeria — The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague has convicted Ali Muhammad Ali Abd–Al-Rahman, a leader of Sudan's notorious Janjaweed militia, for his role in atrocities committed during the genocide in the western region of Darfur more than 20 years ago. It is the court's first conviction for crimes in Darfur, where similar violence has flared again amid Sudan's ongoing civil war.</p> <p>Judges found that mass killings and sexual violence were part of a plan backed by Sudan's former government to crush a rebellion by African ethnic groups in the western region. Abd–Al-Rahman, also known by the nom de guerre Ali Kushayb, was found guilty on 27 counts, carried out between August 2003 and April 2004. He remained silent as the verdict was read out by presiding judge, Joanna Korner.</p>
<p>"The accused was not only giving orders … but was personally involved in the beatings and later was physically present and giving orders for the execution of those detained," said Korner. </p> <p>Abd–Al-Rahman, who claimed he was wrongly identified, will be sentenced at a later date and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Born in 1949, Abd–Al-Rahman fled to the Central African Republic in February 2020 after Sudan's new government announced it would cooperate with the ICC investigation. He later turned himself in, saying he was "desperate" and feared he would be killed by authorities.</p> <p>The conflict in Darfur lasted from 2003 to 2020, and is widely considered to be the 21<sup>st</sup> century's first genocide. During that time the United Nations estimates that the conflict killed 300,000 people and forced 2.5 million from their homes.</p>
<p>Reading out the verdict, Korner recounted the horrific crimes committed by Abd–Al-Rahman, including gang rapes, abuse, and mass killings. Although the ICC has successfully prosecuted Abd–Al-Rahman, several arrest warrants remain outstanding against Sudanese officials, including one accusing former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir of genocide, which he denies. Bashir, who was ousted in a 2019 coup, is reportedly in military custody in northern Sudan.</p>
<p>During the trial, Karim Khan, the ICC chief prosecutor said Abd-Al-Rahman and the Janjaweed militia "rampaged" through Darfur and "inflicted severe pain and suffering on women, children and men in villages that he left in his wake."</p> <p>The Janjaweed later evolved into the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been fighting the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) since 2023. The RSF is accused by the United States, the U.N. and others of committing another genocide in Darfur, displacing thousands, triggering famine and driving the region toward a new humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

<div class="article-title">Bread and Puppet Theater is still working to 'make the revolution irresistible'</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Generations of peacenik Americans first saw Bread and Puppet Theater during anti-war protests. Giant white birds on rods soared high over marchers against U.S. military actions in Vietnam, Central America, Iraq and Gaza. Performers milled on the street with bobbing paper mache heads of Uncle Sam and other caricatures.</p> <p>First founded in 1963, Bread and Puppet has been a mainstay of radical political performance, with its annual Fall Circus touring the country for more than fifty years. Human performers hand out freshly baked sourdough bread to audience members after each show.</p> <p>"The role of the artist is to make the revolution irresistible," says Abril Barajas, with a big smile. The puppeteer, who recently turned 30, is among 15 in the troupe traveling to 33 U.S. cities with this year's show, entitled "Our Domestic Resurrection Revolution In Progress."</p>
<p>It's a wordy title, Barajas admits, but Bread and Puppet's founder, 91-year-old Peter Schumann, loves wordplay. "Peter is all about the revolution and so are we," Barajas says, with reverence. "It's still his show. He's still directing every single show. And he's prolific as ever. I actually would say a lot of what lends to our longevity is the fact that we have a director that we all really trust."</p>
<p>Rooted in 14th century traditions of traveling plays, Bread and Puppet gives a contemporary glowup to medieval mystery cycles, with a tongue-in-cheek version of the Biblical story of creation, as well as pointed political sketches that lampoon greedy billionaires, support American labor unions and criticize Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The 2025 show is staunchly pro-Palestinian, with a mourning puppet in a black abaya carrying a child-shaped shroud and performers waving flags bearing red poppies, a symbol of Palestinian loyalty to the land.</p> <p>"We see people walk out," Barajas acknowledged. "We see people like, realize what we're talking about and walk away."</p> <p>Damien Mars did not walk out. He, along with his partner and teenage daughter, was among hundreds of people applauding a recent performance at an outdoor park in Ypsilanti, Mich.</p>
<p>"I really needed this," he said. "Because I've just been so stressed about everything I see on TV. It's kind of cathartic just to be here and experience it."</p> <p>The puppeteers hope such catharsis will lead to action. However, Abril Barajas said she and her circle of radical Bread and Puppet artists increasingly worry about their own free expression.</p>
<p>"We're all trying to figure out how to walk that line so that we can keep doing our work, because the work is important" she said. "And also preserve the ethos of what we believe in."</p> <p>That ethos includes anti-capitalism, pointed criticism of U.S. foreign policy and old-school 1960s style talk of revolution. All of this at a moment when the White House has released a memo linking domestic terrorism to "anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality."</p> <p>"Yeah, there's fear, for us," Barajas acknowledged. "We're nervous. We're being careful, in the ways we know how. But it's like that whole thing where bravery is being afraid and still doing it."</p> <p>After all, she added, puppets persist and tell stories, even when their stages disappear.</p>

<div class="article-title">The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The federal government is currently shut down, after lawmakers failed to pass a funding bill by 12:01 a.m. on Oct. 1. </p> <p>All non-essential services have been suspended and several hundred thousand federal employees and active-duty service members will work without pay. </p> <p>Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is affecting services across the country. </p> <p>As we enter another week with a lapse in federal funding, here's what we know.</p> <p><em>Jump to state-specific impacts.</em></p> <p><strong>Why did the federal government shut down?</strong> </p> <p>A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid use the system to buy health plans.  </p>
<p>Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the enhanced premium tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer. </p> <p><em>Read more about more on </em><em>the debate over these subsidies </em><em>here.</em> </p> <p><em>— </em><em>Selena Simmons-Duffin</em><em>, NPR</em></p>
<p><strong>What will it take for the government to reopen?</strong> </p> <p>As we approach week two, there has been no movement or progress on ending this government shutdown. Republicans in the House have already passed a measure that would temporarily fund the government until Nov. 21. But in the Senate, Republicans so far do not have enough Democratic support. </p> <p>There's no clear way out, as both parties are in "who blinks first" mode. But here are a few potential scenarios for how this could end:</p> <p><strong>Scenario 1: Democrats fold</strong><br/>Enough moderate Democratic senators side with Republicans to overcome a filibuster and pass a funding bill. That could happen if public pressure becomes too great.</p> <p><strong>Scenario 2: Republicans overstep and feel pressured to the negotiating table</strong><br/>The longer the shutdown goes on, the greater the possibility that Republicans could take the brunt of the blame. That could be the case if Trump's budget director, Russ Vought, gets his way and goes through with his threats of mass firings and cutting off billions of dollars to blue states — something that's not necessary, but intended to get Democrats to cave.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: Elected officials in both parties reach a temporary deal</strong><br/>It's also possible that leaders on Capitol Hill across the aisle cry uncle and vote for more time to negotiate on health care measures that Democrats have been looking to include in the deal. The White House certainly seems to see that it publicly has to show concern about health care, and that could be reflective of the fact that support for the Affordable Care Act is at near-record highs — very different from the 2010s that cost Democrats House seats.</p>
<p>The latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll out last week, taken just before the shutdown occurred, found that Republicans would get more of the blame 38%-27% if the government did shut down. But that's not near a majority. What's more, 31% overall said they would blame both parties equally, including 41% of independents. That means the messaging — and who can peel off the blame-everyone-equally crowd — is going to be key in ending this impasse.</p> <p>The last shutdown, which started in 2018, was the longest in U.S. history — timing out at 35 days. </p> <p><em>— </em><em>Domenico Montanaro</em>, NPR's senior political editor/correspondent</p> <p><strong>What about WIC and SNAP benefits</strong>?</p> <p>Among the first to feel the pinch during this shutdown could be the seven million mothers and young children who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food program.</p> <p>"We have a really short runway here before we would reach a real crisis in program operations," says Nell Menefee-Libey with the National WIC Association. She calculates that runway at about two weeks.</p> <p>Lucia Graves of Lebanon, N.H. told NPR she is counting on the benefits to help feed her family, especially as the cost of groceries is on the rise. But continued access if there's a prolonged shutdown will likely depend on states filling the gap, if their budgets allow.</p>
<p>Beyond WIC, the country's much larger food aid program — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP, previously known as food stamps) — is in better shape moneywise. That's because the debit-like cards people use to buy food are loaded a month in advance, so benefits will continue for October.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Jennifer Ludden</em><em>, NPR</em></p>
<p><strong>USPS is 'open for business as usual'</strong></p> <p>"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown," according to a statement by USPS. The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.</p> <p><strong>As of now, the IRS is operating normally</strong></p> <p>According to the Treasury's contingency plan, the IRS has money to keep working for five business days after a lapse in federal appropriations. </p> <p>That five-day clock runs out Tuesday. It's unclear what will happen after that. </p> <p><em>— </em><em>Scott Horsley</em><em>, NPR</em></p> <p><em>Read more about how </em><em>the shutdown has delayed the jobs report </em><em>and how other critical reports could be held up soon.</em></p> <p><strong>Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might</strong></p> <p>However, 87% of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.</p> <p>In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see  a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is now suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Shannon Bond</em><em>, NPR</em></p> <p>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled. As WPR's Corrinne Hess reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that student financial aid programs will continue, despite the shutdown.</p>
<p><strong>National Parks are a mixed bag</strong></p> <p>Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt. </p>
<p>As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails "will generally remain accessible to visitors" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.</p> <p>Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.</p> <p>A previous government shutdown, Texas Public Radio's Jerry Clayton reported, saw an ancient rock at Big Bend vandalized amid the lack of staffing.</p> <p><em>Read more on </em><em>the impact to the national parks system here</em><em>.</em> </p> <p><em>— </em><em>Alana Wise</em><em>, NPR</em></p> <p><strong>Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue</strong></p> <p>Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue. There could still be some delay in services, such as processing applications.</p> <p><em>Read more on </em><em>how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown</em><em> from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin.</em></p> <p><strong>There could be missed paychecks and lost jobs</strong></p> <p>Perhaps the biggest impacts will be felt by federal workers and active-duty military service members who will not receive a paycheck during the government shutdown. </p> <p>The Congressional Budget Office estimated earlier this week that roughly 750,000 federal employees would be furloughed each day of the shutdown.</p> <p><em>Here's </em><em>the latest breakdown on temporary furloughs</em><em> during the government shutdown by agency.</em></p> <p>Wildfire and other emergency response personnel, for example, will continue to work, but in many cases without pay.</p> <p>In addition to furloughing employees, during the lead up to the shutdown, the White House also threatened mass layoffs (a reduction in force, or RIF) of federal employees should the government shut down.</p> <p>Because the government shut down close to the end of a pay period, federal employees will see their first full missed paycheck on Oct. 24, while for the military it will be Oct. 15.</p>
<p><strong>ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted</strong></p> <p>Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions.</p> <p>Customs inspection and immigration law enforcement are considered "essential" functions that will continue during any lapse in appropriations, though workers may not get paid until the shutdown is over.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Anna Yukhananov</em><em> and </em><em>Ximena Bustillo</em><em>, NPR</em></p>
<p><strong>If you're flying soon …</strong></p> <p>Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered "essential workers" and have to stay on the job.</p> <p>Air traffic controllers helped to end the last government shutdown, and could help end this one as well. A "slight increase" in sick leave at two facilities on the East Coast threw some major airports into chaos.</p> <p><em>Read more on</em><em> what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown</em><em> from NPR's Joel Rose.</em></p>
<p><strong>The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country</strong></p> <p>Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown.</p> <p>Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region.</p> <p>Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country:</p> <p><strong>Alaska</strong><br/></p>

<div class="article-title">The CDC says people must consult a health professional before COVID shot</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday accepted controversial new guidelines for the updated COVID-19 vaccines that could make it harder for many people to protect themselves this winter compared with previous years.</p> <p>Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill agreed to the recommendations for the COVID shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which met in September.</p>
<p>Unlike in earlier years, the new guidelines call for people to talk to a doctor, pharmacist or some other health care provider about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated before they get a shot. This extra step is called "shared decision-making,"or "individual-based decision-making" according to the language in the press release.</p> <p>The move is the final action necessary for implementing the new guidelines, which affect who can get and give the COVID shot, and whether vaccination will be covered by private and government insurance without copayments.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>Final recommendations were delayed</strong></h3> <p>The step came after an unusual, unexplained two-week lag between when CDC advisers issued the recommendations and the agency accepted them. The official decision allows the CDC to finally start shipping vaccines to doctors, clinics and other providers through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines free to about 40% of all U.S. children.</p> <p>"Informed consent is back," O'Neill said in a statement announcing the step. "CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today."</p> <p>Independent vaccine experts challenged that claim.</p> <p>"There is no basis to claim that routine recommendations prevent doctors from discussing risks and benefits with patients," said Dorit Reiss, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. "Doctors [have always been] required to get informed consent. Shared clinical decision-making simply signals the vaccine is not routinely recommended and decreases uptake."</p> <p>Others agree O'Neill's claim is false and could undermine public confidence in the vaccines.</p> <p>"The claim that the past recommendations deterred health care professionals from talking to patients about risks is completely untrue and is another example of the misinformation and made up information that this administration continues to release to the public and further creates confusion and distrust in healthcare providers and vaccines," wrote Dr. Tina Tan, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. "This is extremely unfortunate and critically increases the American public's risk for serious vaccine preventable diseases."</p>
<p>The CDC also formalized a recommendation that makes it more complicated for some parents to get their babies vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.</p> <p>"If that's his approach, I am concerned about [additional] childhood vaccines recommended for routine use," Reiss added in an email. "If he thinks a routine recommendation undermines informed consent — which it doesn't — that could further reduce uptake and may make the Trump-Kennedy outbreaks of measles and pertussis we are seeing even larger."</p> <p>The moves guarantee continued insurance coverage for the COVID shots and allows pharmacists nationwide to keep administering the vaccines. But the changes withdraw some government coverage for the combination shot that protects against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox and that some parents prefer.</p> <p>In previous years, the COVID-19 vaccines have been easily available for free to anyone 6 months and older by simply walking into a pharmacy, doctor's office or clinic and asking for a shot.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Barriers to vaccination</h3> <p>But the vaccines became harder to get in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax vaccines only for people at increased risk for serious disease because they are age 65 or older or had some other health issue.</p> <p>The change occurred because top Trump administration health officials say they have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, even though there is overwhelming evidence the vaccines are very safe and highly effective. Federal health officials also argue that most people have so much immunity now that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.</p> <p>Many public health experts agree that COVID no longer poses the serious risk it once did to many people, especially those who are younger and otherwise healthy. Other countries have also shifted to a more "risk-based" COVID vaccination strategy.</p> <p>But some healthy people still want to get vaccinated to reduce their risk of getting sick at all, missing work or school, developing long COVID or spreading the virus to vulnerable people, such as older family members and friends with other health issues.</p>
<p>Over the past month, the change caused anger, frustration and confusion. In states like Georgia and Utah, people had to get a prescription to get a shot and some couldn't get vaccinated at all.</p>
<p>The situation was further complicated because Kennedy, who has a long history of criticizing vaccines, said the government was no longer recommending the vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children, even though pregnancy is listed as a risk factor by the CDC and FDA, and COVID can still make some kids very sick.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the vaccine panel, which gives influential advice to the CDC, voted to recommend the shots for anyone 6 months and older, provided they consult with a health care provider about the risks and benefits.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Confusion still reigns </h3> <p>The requirement for shared clinical decision-making creates a new hurdle to getting vaccinated compared with previous years, by explicitly requiring a conversation with a provider on an individual's risks and benefits before they get one.</p> <p>The new guidelines continue to ensure coverage by private and public insurers, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Vaccines for Children Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program.</p> <p>The recommendation should also clarify that anyone age 6 months and older is eligible for the COVID vaccine, including healthy children, pregnant women and younger adults. (The only way to protect younger babies, who are among those who face the greatest risk from COVID, is by immunizing their mothers during pregnancy.)</p> <p>But some providers may remain confused or hesitant to administer the shots because of lingering uncertainty and mixed messages, for instance, speculative safety risks presented during the CDC's advisory committee meeting that are not backed by solid evidence.</p> <p>Some states and major medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued separate guidelines recommending the shots to most everyone ages 6 months and up, to protect themselves and their communities this upcoming respiratory virus season.</p>
<p>In addition, more doctor's offices may opt against stocking the new vaccines because of concerns the debate may further dampen demand, requiring people to go elsewhere, such as a pharmacy.</p> <p>Some pharmacies may require patients to read and fill out a form that discusses the potential risks and benefits of the vaccines. But CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, says people will be able to get a COVID vaccines simply by asking for one. Pharmacists won't have to require anything, including even a conversation, unless patients have questions, CVS says.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A separate shot for chickenpox is now recommended </h3> <p>O'Neill also accepted the panel's vote to ban the MMRV combination shot, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or chickenpox, for children under 4.</p> <p>Young children can gain the same protection by getting separate shots for MMR and varicella, and most of them – some 85% – already do, according to CDC data shared and discussed at the advisory committee's September meeting.</p> <p>That's because the combination shot is associated with a slightly higher risk of fevers that can lead to seizures in kids under 4. Because of the risk the CDC has, for more than 15 years, preferred that children under 4 receive the shots separately. Still, some parents were choosing to get the combo shot, because it was easier or more available, and the risk associated with the potentially frightening but temporary side effect is low.</p> <p>Because of the recommendation, the MMRV vaccine will no longer be covered by federal programs that offer subsidized vaccines. "This panel has made a recommendation for a practice that's essentially in place anyway, but removed the option of having those vaccines financed for those who may think this is a better option," says Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist who worked on vaccine policy for more than a decade at CDC, before retiring from the agency in 2023, "This is effectively removing a choice from parents."</p>
<p>Making different policies from the same safety information that was thoroughly examined years ago will also raise mistrust among parents, Kretsinger says. "There is confusion about how to proceed, and also doubts raised by the fact that this is being re-examined," she says, "It furthers the chilling effect on vaccine uptake."</p> <p>The change may also cause shortages of the separate vaccines, at least initially, until manufacturers can adjust their production to meet the new demand.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A fresh call to break up the MMR vaccine</h3> <p>A few hours after issuing the new vaccine guidelines, Acting CDC Director O'Neill also called on makers of the combined MMR vaccine to break it up into three separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella in a post on X.com. The post praised President Trump for his leadership and reposted his call in September that the MMR vaccine be administered as "THREE TOTALLY SEPARATE SHOTS."</p> <p>The combination shot for measles, mumps and rubella has been used in the U.S. for decades.</p> <p>"This really is absolutely completely ridiculous and really sets us back over 50 years in time given that the MMR vaccine was licensed here in the US in 1971," said Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. "It was made as a combination vaccine to ensure that persons would receive all the vaccines that they would need as a single shot as opposed to 3 separate injections. This is crazy and continues to erode the public health system and the public trust in vaccines."</p> <p>"There is no published scientific evidence that shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine into three individual shots," said a statement from Merck, which makes an MMR vaccine. "Use of the individual components of combination vaccines increases the number of injections for the individual and may result in delayed or missed immunizations."</p>
<p>The statement also said that evidence suggests combination vaccines improve outcomes for kids by increasing completion of recommended vaccines and getting them at the right ages. Merck also said there are no single-shot vaccines approved for use in the U.S. for measles, mumps or rubella.</p> <p>"Combination vaccines play a crucial role in improving vaccination coverage rates; their safety and efficacy have been demonstrated by decades of research," said a statement from GSK, maker of the other MMR vaccine available in the U.S. "By reducing the number of separate injections required, combination vaccines allow for a simpler and more efficient immunization process, which is essential for timely protection against disease."</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A federal judge in Illinois declined to immediately block the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in the state, giving the administration until Wednesday night to respond to the lawsuit filed by Illinois and Chicago.</p> <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago filed the federal lawsuit on Monday against the Trump administration over its effort to deploy National Guard troops to the state, a day after a federal judge blocked any federalized Guard members from deploying to Oregon.</p> <p>Illinois and Chicago asked the judge to block the Trump administration from federalizing the Illinois National Guard and from sending to Illinois any guard members from other states, including Texas.</p>
<p>But U.S. District Judge April Perry allowed the Trump administration until 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday to respond to the lawsuit and set a date for oral arguments to take place, at 11 a.m. Thursday.</p> <p>In the lawsuit, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul wrote: "The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president's favor."</p>
<p>It's the latest turn in a dizzying three-day saga that saw the Trump administration order the federalization of National Guard troops in Illinois and Oregon as well as dispatch Guard members there from other states.</p> <p>President Trump has for weeks promised to send National Guard members to Chicago and Portland, cities he's characterized as overrun with crime and in need of federal law enforcement help. The administration has also said the troops will be used to protect federal immigration agents and federal property. </p>
<p>Local and state leaders in Illinois and Oregon have said National Guard troops are not needed and that Trump is abusing his power. Violent crime is at a low point in Chicago, along with other cities Trump has threatened with National Guard deployments.</p>
<p>Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said on Sunday night that Trump's "actions are an effort to occupy and incite cities and states that don't share his politics, and I believe that we should expect him to continue to push the limits of his authority."</p> <p>The Trump administration's attempts to deploy the National Guard into the two Democratic-run cities come after it sent guard members into Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., earlier this year.</p> <p>Here are the latest updates.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Chicago sued Trump as it braces for troops</h3> <p>The lawsuit filed Monday argues that the Trump administration can only federalize a state's National Guard in cases of invasion, rebellion or if the federal government cannot enforce federal laws — and that none of those circumstances exist.</p> <p>Christopher Wells, a lawyer with the Illinois attorney general's office, said during Monday's hearing that the Trump administration was making a "concerted effort to target disfavored jurisdictions that the president doesn't like" and that the court "has to put a stop to it," WBEZ reported.</p> <p>Over the weekend, Trump authorized the deployment of at least 300 members of the Illinois National Guard. A Pentagon memo viewed by NPR suggested the troops would be used to protect federal property as well as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Federal Protective Service agents and other federal employees.</p> <p>Additionally, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he had approved Trump's request to call up 400 members of the Texas National Guard, with some of them slated to go to Illinois.</p>
<p>Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat who has clashed with Trump, blasted the administration's actions over the weekend.</p> <p>"We must now start calling this what it is: Trump's Invasion," Pritzker said in a post on X. "It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state's military troops."</p> <p>On Saturday, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement that Trump had federalized the Illinois National Guard troops "[a]midst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness" in Chicago in order to "protect federal officers and assets," WBEZ reported.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">A judge blocks the National Guard deployment in Oregon</h3> <p>In Oregon, a federal judge late Sunday evening temporarily blocked the Trump administration from sending National Guard members from any other states to Oregon.</p> <p>The ruling was in response to news that Trump had dispatched members of the California National Guard to Oregon and had also gotten approval from Texas to do the same.</p>
<p>Oregon and Portland — along with the state of California — went to court and asked U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut to block the move. It was one day after she had temporarily blocked Trump from federalizing the Oregon National Guard.</p> <p>"I am certainly troubled by now hearing that both California and Texas are being sent to Oregon, which does appear to be in direct contradiction of my order," Immergut, who was appointed to the federal bench by Trump in 2019, wrote in her order, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported.</p> <p>Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield praised the judge's ruling Sunday night. "The president can't keep playing whack-a-mole w/ different states' Guard units to get around court orders &amp; the rule of law," he wrote on X.</p> <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a press briefing Monday afternoon that the administration was appealing the decision, and that the ICE facility there had been "under siege" by protesters.</p> <p>"These people are not there to peacefully protest," she said. "They are there to cause mayhem and havoc."</p>
<p>One day earlier, Immergut ruled that the Trump administration hadn't met the threshold for declaring that recent protests outside a Portland ICE facility constituted a rebellion, saying those demonstrations have generally been fewer than 30 people and "largely sedate."</p> <p>The Trump administration had federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard the previous Sunday, according to a memo sent to Kotek from the Department of Defense.</p> <p>Trump said after the judge's initial ruling that he hadn't seen the order blocking the federalization of the Oregon National Guard, but that "that judge ought to be ashamed of themselves."</p>

<div class="article-title">A major census test begins recruiting workers as some warn about delays</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The next U.S. census isn't scheduled to be taken until 2030, but the federal government says help is wanted well before then in six states for the national head count's major field test.</p> <p>Recruiting to hire about 1,500 door knockers and other temporary workers for the "2026 Census Test" starts Monday in parts of Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas, the Census Bureau announced on its website. The agency says it received a temporary exemption from President Trump's freeze on hiring federal civilian workers.</p> <p>The census test is supposed to help the bureau develop better ways of getting complete and accurate population counts and demographic data, especially of historically undercounted populations such as children under the age of 5, people of color and renters.</p>
<p>Some people living outside of the test sites may also receive invitations in the mail to participate starting in March 2026 as part of what the bureau calls a "nationally representative sample of households."</p>
<p>While the ongoing federal shutdown has put a halt to work on new government statistics, test preparations have continued because Commerce Department officials supervising the bureau have deemed it a "mission critical priority" ahead of the constitutionally required tally in 2030.</p> <p>Last month, however, the Commerce Department inspector general's office raised concerns that the bureau may not be able to recruit enough workers for the test. Uncertain funding from Congress and Trump's hiring freeze led to the bureau putting off finalizing a staffing plan, an audit by the inspector general found.</p> <p>At a September hearing on Capitol Hill, Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan flagged that the bureau's hiring for the test is "behind the curve of what we've seen in the past."</p> <p>"The Census Bureau has refused to provide updates to me on the status of preparation for this test," added Peters, the top Democrat overseeing the bureau on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.</p> <p>The bureau's public information office did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.</p>
<p>Monday's announcement from the bureau also comes after the agency made the rare move of withdrawing a public update on the test that was set to be published in the Federal Register. The since-removed version of the notice said the bureau plans to try using U.S. Postal Service mail carriers to conduct census interviews at two census test sites, while reducing its estimate of test participants by about 30% and scaling back plans for counting people in group-living quarters such as college dorms.</p>
<p>"The whole operation is very complex," says Allison Plyer, a former adviser to the bureau, who now co-chairs the Census Quality Reinforcement Task Force at the National Conference on Citizenship. "They need to be able to test a lot of these procedures, and they haven't gotten the budget increases that they would need and they normally get at this point in the 10-year cycle. So there's a lot of concern and also a lot of mystery. We're just not seeing the kind of transparency about how they're going to do this work that we have in previous decades."</p> <p>Local officials at two of the six census test sites, which were announced last year, told NPR they have also been in the dark. The bureau had said efforts to raise "awareness in the test sites about the importance of participating" would begin this past summer. But Lottie Barker, manager of western North Carolina's Swain County, and Curtis Evans, judge of western Texas' Jeff Davis County, said no one from the agency has talked to them or their staff about the test as of last week.</p> <p>"I am hopeful that it will be easy to recruit those temporary workers," Barker said in an email, "but many times this is hard depending on what commitments community members already have."</p> <p>Changes the Trump administration has made at the bureau in recent months — including slashing its permanent workforce and installing a new acting director with no obvious qualifications for the role — are also prompting questions about its ability to produce reliable statistics.</p> <p>Official 2030 census numbers are set to be used to determine each state's share of congressional seats and Electoral College votes in the next decade.</p> <p>According to the 14th Amendment, the "whole number of persons in each state" must be included in the census apportionment counts. But Trump and a growing number of Republican lawmakers in Congress are calling for the exclusion of some or all non-U.S. citizens living in the states — an unprecedented change that, if carried out, would likely spark new lawsuits.</p>
<p>Data from the census are also used to distribute federal funding for public services in local communities and redraw maps of voting districts for every level of government across the country.</p>
