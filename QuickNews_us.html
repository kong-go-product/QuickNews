<div class="article-title">Rutgers chancellor launches safety review, ‘academic freedom’ task force amid ‘Dr Antifa’ uproar</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The chancellor of Rutgers University said the Ivy League institution is committed to academic freedom and will be launching a safety review and "academic freedom" task force amid the ongoing controversy surrounding Antifa-aligned professor Mark Bray. </p><p>"I write today to reaffirm Rutgers University’s unwavering commitment to academic freedom and freedom of expression—values that define a great research university and underpin our mission of discovery, dialogue, and public engagement," Rutgers Chancellor Francine Conway wrote in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital. </p><p>"Incidents involving ‘doxing’ and harassment of faculty members understandably raise deep concerns across our community," Conway wrote. "I want to express my support for any member of our community who has been targeted for their scholarship."</p><p>Earlier this month, members of Rutgers’ Turning Point USA chapter launched a petition to remove assistant teaching professor Mark Bray, citing concerns over his past statements supporting Antifa. </p><p>Bray, who recently announced he was moving his family to Europe "for safety reasons," and said that he had been doxxed and "received multiple death threats" has expressed strong support for "antifacism" ​​in previous online posts. </p><p>He is the author of "Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook," which openly calls for "militant anti-fascism." That book says that "at the very least 50 percent of author proceeds will go to the International Anti-Fascist Defense Fund, which is administered by more than three hundred antifa from eighteen countries." </p><p>On its website, the International Anti-Fascist Defense Fund says that it has "provided over $250,000 USD to more than 800 anti-fascists in 26 different countries."</p><p>In her statement, Conway said she has directed Rutgers’ chief of police and chief information technology officer to review protocols for both physical and digital safety on campus.</p><p>"I therefore want to express, in the strongest possible terms, not only my personal abhorrence of the practice of doxing and threatening our faculty and students, but also the university’s commitment to protecting the security of our faculty, students, and staff from the consequences of having their personal information publicly disseminated." </p><p>Conway said the officials will assess existing systems and "report any additional recommendations" to strengthen protections.</p><p>She also asked Rutgers’ faculty council to conduct a review of academic freedom "given the current challenges."</p><p>"Free speech and academic freedom do not shield any of us from disagreement or critique," Conway wrote. "At Rutgers, we encourage open and robust debate—even on the most controversial topics. Yet, the appropriate response to speech we oppose is more speech, not actions that seek to intimidate or threaten the personal safety of others."</p><p>Megyn Doyle, a student at Rutgers and the treasurer for the Turning Point USA chapter, told Fox News Digital in an interview that Conway's statement "is in clear defense of Mark Bray and his affiliation with Antifa. While the statement aims to uphold academic freedom, freedom of speech, and open debate, Mark Bray’s continuous record shows otherwise. Through his book, ‘Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook,’ calls for political violence and affiliation with Antifa, he has repeatedly shown hostility towards conservatives." </p><p>Doyle added that "If Rutgers truly aims to protect academic freedom, freedom of speech and open debate, it must hold Mark Bray to that same standard." </p><p>"Defending a professor who aims to silence conservatives undermines Chancellor Conway’s statement altogether," Doyle said. "Therefore, we call on Rutgers to take immediate action and end their professional relationship with Mark Bray."</p><p>Ava Kwan, the outreach coordinator for the Turning Point USA chapter, told Fox News Digital that Rutgers "is whitewashing Bray’s call for ‘preemptive violence’ against conservatives as ‘scholarship.’" </p><p>"His financial support for terrorists and Turning Point’s protected right to petition are not the same," Kwan added. "They are running cover for the radical left and burying any mention of the doxxing campaign against my family!"</p><p>Kwan has said that she has been doxxed on platforms like Reddit.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Rutgers for comment. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Louvre heist adds to history of high-profile museum breaches, leaves other galleries on edge</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>While the daring Sunday robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris continues to capture worldwide attention, it's not the first time priceless artifacts have been stolen from the museum's collection — and it's almost certainly put other museums on high alert about safeguarding their own treasures.</p><p>Thieves looted France’s most famous crown jewels, including an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, as Fox News Digital previously reported about the Louvre heist. </p><p>Prosecutors revealed Monday that a vest, bottle of liquid and equipment left behind at the scene are now being examined. </p><p>The brazen Sunday theft — which has prompted a security review at the Louvre, Reuters reported, as well as reviews at other cultural sites — brings to mind another robbery that occurred over a century ago in the same location.   </p><p>In August 1911, "panic broke out at the Louvre" when Leonardo da Vinci’s "Mona Lisa" was found to have disappeared.</p><p>A thief had swiped the painting from its frame — and escaped with it by hiding the work of art under his coat.</p><p>"The news [of the theft] spread like wildfire and generous rewards were promised for her return," the Louvre recounts on its website. </p><p>Two years later, Vincenzo Peruggia — a glazier who had worked at the Louvre — tried to sell the da Vinci masterpiece that he'd stolen to an Italian art dealer.</p><p>The dealer alerted authorities — and the world’s most famous painting was ultimately returned to the Louvre. Peruggia was arrested and served only a short prison term for the theft, according to History.com and other sources. </p><p>Another heist, far more recent, took place at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. It remains unsolved to this day. </p><p>Two men disguised as local police officers entered the museum in the early hours of March 18, 1990, saying they were responding to a call of a disturbance, according to The Associated Press.</p><p>The men overtook two security guards and tied them up with duct tape.</p><p>The thieves were able to steal 13 pieces of art, including works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas and Manet, in the approximately 81 minutes they spent there. </p><p>The masterpieces, including Rembrandt’s "Storm on the Sea of Galilee," were estimated to be worth as much as half a billion dollars at the time of the heist.</p><p>The empty frames left by the thieves still hang in the museum to this day. "It's an intentional choice designed to send a message to the public — a reminder of what was lost and hope that what was once there will someday return," according to the FBI's website.  </p><p>In September 2025, just a month before the most recent Louvre heist, thieves broke into Paris' Natural History Museum. They stole gold samples worth about $700,000, according to Agence France-Presse and the museum itself. </p><p>The intruders were said to have used an angle grinder and a blow torch to force their way into the complex, as Artnet.com and others reported. </p><p>It prompted a museum spokesperson to declare that this is a "critical time for cultural institutions" in France, the same source noted.</p><p>A number of prominent museums around the world house highly valuable collections.</p><p>The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History contains a collection known as "one of the world’s largest of its kind" for gem and mineral specimens, according to the Gemological Institute of America (GIA).</p><p>The museum’s national gem and mineral collection comprises some 350,000 mineral specimens and 10,000 gems.</p><p>The star of the show is the Hope Diamond, with a weight of 44 carats to 45.5 carats, according to the Smithsonian. </p><p>The large stone is described as a "fancy dark grayish-blue" color; it first belonged to King Louis XIV.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Fabergé Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia, has the largest collection of decorative art and jewelry by Carl Fabergé.</p><p>Some of the most notable items include the Hen Easter Egg, gifted by Emperor Alexander III to his wife, Empress Maria Feodorovna, for Easter in 1885.</p><p>The Coronation Easter Egg, gifted by Emperor Nicholas II to his wife Empress Alexandra Feodorovna for Easter in 1897, is also on display.</p><p><i>Reuters contributed reporting.</i> </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">BRET BAIER: Teddy Roosevelt's powerful lessons -- strength, duty, country</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p></p><p>Teddy Roosevelt looked into the American heart and declared it good. And America looked at Roosevelt and saw its greatness reflected back. To this day, more than a century after his passing, Roosevelt remains one of our most admired presidents. </p><p>This week marks the publication of my latest presidential biography, "To Rescue the American Spirit: Teddy Roosevelt and the Birth of a Superpower." It was an exhilarating experience for me to live for a time in the world of our twenty-sixth president.</p><p>Born two years before the Civil War, when America would be tested as never before, Roosevelt rose to the presidency at the turn of the twentieth century, when the country was bristling with opportunity. Things could have gone a couple of different ways. </p><p>The Gilded Age had created great wealth but also crushing income inequality. There was a pattern of corruption and indifference to public life. On the world stage, the U.S. was inclined to be neutral and uninvolved — the success in the Spanish-American War a one-off. Had we continued on that path, we might have faltered. But Roosevelt broke through the malaise and inertia. </p><p>Roosevelt came into office through a presidential assassination. Everyone wanted to know if he would be loyal to the policies of his deceased predecessor, William McKinley. He wanted to ease their worries by making that promise, but it went against his nature to adhere to the status quo just as a matter of loyalty — to party or person. He set his own course — and in the process changed the course of history. </p><p>How he succeeded is a thrilling story, explored in depth in my book. But I have chosen four core reasons why Roosevelt was a great man and a great president. </p><p>The founders of our nation set great store by the importance of morality. John Adams declared, "Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other." Ben Franklin agreed. "Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom," he wrote. "As nations become corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters."</p><p>Roosevelt learned the importance of morality at his father’s knee. A prominent businessman and philanthropist known for his good works, the elder Theodore Roosevelt often told his children that morality was a higher value than status, wealth, or fame. "Take care of your morals first," he told his son as he headed off for college, and Teddy heeded the lesson. After his father died suddenly while he was at Harvard, Teddy wondered how he would measure up to his towering ethics. He spent the rest of his life trying. </p><p>In public service, Roosevelt was always mindful of the moral mandate as he grappled with the gritty affairs of men. The key for him was to be uncompromising when it came to values. He once mused, "There will be some fool who will say: ‘Well, yes, maybe he is a little crooked; but he is 'dreadful smart.' That kind of praise speaks ill for the man praised and ill for the man who praises him. We cannot afford, as citizens of this republic, to tolerate the successful scoundrel any more than the unsuccessful scoundrel." </p><p>Today, when we hear America referred to as the leader of the free world, we have Roosevelt to thank. He set the course like a tall ship sailing international waters, erecting a presence for the U.S. in the world that had never existed before. </p><p>President Roosevelt’s role brokering an agreement in the Russo-Japanese war may seem like an obscure historical footnote. It isn’t talked about much. But it was America’s entre into a larger global role. Later, Roosevelt demonstrated a peaceful global dominance when he sent the nation’s "Great White Fleet" of battleships on a world tour. </p><p>Out of office as the world went to war in 1914, he became the loudest voice in favor of America’s entry into the war. Beating down resistance from the pacifist President Woodrow Wilson, he scoffed at pacifism as the equivalent of retreat from responsibility to the human race — and called it unpatriotic. He said, "Pacifism has proved the most powerful possible anesthetic of patriotism, courage and manliness. Our present business is to restore to the nation these virtues." </p><p>When America finally entered the war, Roosevelt wanted to serve, but President Wilson declared him past his prime. However, all four of his sons joined the war effort. His youngest son Quentin, a fighter pilot, died on a mission. Emotionally devastated by the loss, Roosevelt didn’t falter. He continued on with a scheduled speech in New York and praised the contribution of the fighting martyrs. "These are the torch bearers," he said through tears. "These are they who have dared the Great Adventure." </p><p>He came from privilege but felt a strong connection to the common worker. He fought for workers’ rights, connecting the ability of workers to earn a living wage to their ability to be good citizens. Roosevelt put the matter in words everyone could understand. "No man can be a good citizen unless he has a wage more than sufficient to cover the bare cost of living, and hours of labor short enough so after his day's work is done, he will have time and energy to bear his share in the management of the community, to help in carrying the general load." </p><p>Roosevelt always had an affinity for the common man, whether it was the ranchers or horsemen of his beloved western plains or the miners whose hardships touched him so deeply that he fought for their cause. In every case, his attention was on harnessing the great American spirit, present in its people, for the future he envisioned.</p><p>He did it all with a passion and joy unusual to chief executives. The White House under Roosevelt was a vibrant, noisy, happy place, full of children, animals, and the great booming laughter of the president. He embodied the daring spirit of a new century in a manner that gave permission to others to embrace adventure. </p><p>After his presidency, Roosevelt gave one of the most important calls to action of his time with a speech that still resonates. Called Citizenship in a Republic, it is known as the "Man in the Arena" speech. In a straightforward way, he laid out the fundamental premise of citizenship, stating, "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena."</p><p>In powerful prose born of a conviction deep in his soul, Roosevelt called on his countrymen to engage fully in their citizenship — to dare greatly in a worthy cause. </p><p>Words and actions like these make Teddy Roosevelt a unique and wonderful voice — the all-American man whose life epitomized what we strive for as a nation. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Teen murder suspect allegedly swatted victim's home weeks before deadly hit-and-run: lawyer</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The 17-year-old accused of killing two teen girls in a hit-and-run murder is accused in two "swatting" incidents at one of the victim's homes in the weeks before she was killed.</p><p>Maria Niotis and Isabella Salas were killed on Monday, Sept. 29, while riding an electric bike when an unnamed 17-year-old male allegedly hit them both at around 5:26 p.m., the Union County Prosecutor's Office said. The two girls, who were both 17, were pronounced dead after arriving at area hospitals. Fox News Digital isn't naming the suspect as he hasn't yet been charged as an adult.</p><p>Brent Bramnick, who is representing Niotis’ family, told Fox News Digital that the suspect allegedly swatted the family's home in Cranford, New Jersey, twice in September. He said both incidents took place between Sept. 1 and 15.</p><p>After the first alleged swatting incident, Bramnick said that police were informed, but added he has "no information" suggesting there was any investigation done by law enforcement.</p><p>In the second incident, Bramnick said police showed up at the family's front doorstep, with the 17-year-old murder suspect parked in front of their house.</p><p>"She tells the police that there is the juvenile defendant over there," Bramnick said.</p><p>After police talked with the now-murder suspect, Niotis' mother, Foulla, was told by officers that the juvenile would be released to his father, Bramnick said.</p><p>After the two incidents, Bramnick said the Niotis family wants to know "what went on?"</p><p>"What investigation, if any, went on after all that the family reported and all the information that the police had in their possession. That's the question. So we need those questions answered," Bramnick said. "And that's why we're involved, because we're doing our own investigations to try to get to the bottom of those questions."</p><p>The driver of the car, from Garwood, New Jersey, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Police said the suspect was driving a 2021 black Jeep Compass at the time of the crash.</p><p>In a statement to Fox News Digital, Union County Prosecutor's Office Public Information Officer Lauren Farinas said that the suspect was detained after the incident for questioning, but released.</p><p>"Shortly after the incident on Monday, Sept. 29, the suspect was detained and questioned by law enforcement officers. The suspect was subsequently released pending further investigation. Officers then arrested the suspect on Wednesday morning, Oct. 1, after complaints were approved for two counts of first-degree murder," Farinas wrote.</p><p>The 17-year-old is currently in custody, she added.</p><p>Foulla Niotis told Fox News previously that the suspect "planned" the attack and thought he was "untouchable" because he had relatives working in law enforcement.</p><p>She said that local police didn't take action when they reported the suspect to law enforcement after he was allegedly stalking Maria.</p><p>"They should have done a lot. They didn't do anything," Niotis said of local law enforcement. "They didn't do anything to help my baby."</p><p>"I want justice for Maria and Isabella. That's what I want," she added.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the Cranford Police Department for comment.</p><p><i>Fox News' Eric Shawn contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Prince Andrew humiliated again as Virginia Giuffre book revives sweaty excuse, branded morally blind: experts</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Prince Andrew is facing another wave of humiliation due to his accuser Virginia Giuffre's upcoming posthumous memoir, "Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice."</p><p>In the bombshell book, Giuffre — who died by suicide at the age of 41 earlier this year — recalled the multiple sexual encounters she allegedly had with the disgraced royal when she was just 17. </p><p>She accused the prince of treating her as a "birthright," describes being trafficked for sex by Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and recounted an alleged group sex encounter and how she "believed that I might die a sex slave."</p><p>In addition to her explosive allegations, Giuffre made scathing remarks about Andrew's disastrous 2019 BBC "Newsnight" interview, reviving the conversation around the TV appearance that triggered the downfall of his public life. </p><p>"He said he had no recollection of ever meeting me—‘None whatsoever.’ Most outlandishly, he said he couldn’t have danced sweatily with me at the Tramp nightclub, as I’d described, because he’d temporarily developed an inability to perspire after enduring ‘an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War,'—a bizarre reference to his military service nineteen years prior to our meeting," she wrote in a copy of the book, obtained by Fox News Digital. </p><p>Andrew's interview centered on his friendship with convicted sex-offender Epstein and Giuffre's allegations that he had sex with her when she was underage. The royal agreed to the interview in order to clear his name and explain his relationship with Epstein. </p><p>Instead, the interview became infamous due to Andrew’s defensive and tone-deaf answers. After it aired on Nov. 16, 2019, the response was overwhelmingly negative. </p><p>The interview was branded a "car crash" and a PR disaster, with widespread disbelief at Andrew’s explanations and criticism of his lack of empathy along with other odd moments, including the references to not sweating.</p><p>Media, politicians, and the public widely viewed it as catastrophic for both his personal reputation and the monarchy’s image. Within days, Buckingham Palace announced that Andrew would step back from public duties "for the foreseeable future." He later lost his military titles and royal patronages, and corporate sponsors and charities cut ties with him and his initiatives. </p><p>Meanwhile, Giuffre wrote "as devastating as this interview was for Prince Andrew, for my legal team it was like an injection of jet fuel."</p><p>In 2021, Giuffre filed a sexual abuse lawsuit against Andrew, who has consistently denied her allegations. In her memoir, she recounted his alleged attempts to discredit and intimidate her as well as reinforce his statements that they had never met.  Giuffre wrote that the royal's team "went so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me" and claimed his protection officers attempted to "dig up dirt" on her.</p><p>While speaking with Fox News Digital, royal expert Hilary Fordwich weighed in on the fallout from the book. </p><p>"In addition to all we know, [Andrew] comes across even worse as unrepentant and manipulative. This is ghastly for the royal family," she said.</p><p>"The orgy with eight others is revolting," Fordwich continued. "Her quote that he was having sex with her if having sex with me was his birthright is damning and all the cover-up attempts, which demonstrate deliberate actions and contradict his Newsnight interview where he stated he didn’t even know Giuffre. If he didn’t know her, then why was he trying to cover up?"</p><p>On Oct. 19, The Mail on Sunday published leaked emails suggesting Andrew passed Giuffre’s date of birth and her Social Security number to his personal protection officer with instructions to investigate if she had a criminal record in the U.S. — a step that could be part of a smear-campaign strategy.</p><p>The leaked emails were reportedly sent hours before the 2011 release of a now-infamous photo showing Andrew with an underage Giuffre. In a statement, London's Metropolitan Police told the Guardian, "We are aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made."</p><p>Sources also told the BBC that the recent claims about Andrew are being treated by Buckingham Palace with "very great concern and should be examined in the appropriate ways to the fullest extent."</p><p>Fordwich noted that, "Andrew’s team attempting to hire online trolls in order to harass her so as to cast doubt regarding her credibility during her U.S. lawsuit in a smear campaign, which is now being investigated by British police is also horrendous. It indicates such hubris, moral blindness and entitlement."</p><p>Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams explained that Giuffre's depiction of Andrew in the memoir and her revival of his 2019 interview could deepen the lasting damage to his reputation and future within the royal family.</p><p>"The portrait she paints of Andrew is of a bovine, entitled and supercilious individual, in some ways never out of the nursery," he told Fox News Digital. </p><p>"If his Newsnight interview did not exist, no one would have been able to invent it outside a spoof," Fitzwilliams continued. "Yet he was a brave pilot before he succumbed to the lure of disastrous friendships like that of the deceased pedophile Epstein."</p><p>In August 2019, four months before Andrew's interview, Epstein died in prison while facing federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.</p><p>After a U.S. judge rejected Andrew's bid to dismiss Giuffre's civil lawesuit, the two sides reached an out-of-court settlement in February 2022. </p><p>Royal commentator Amanda Matta told Fox News Digital that Andrew could potentially face legal consequences over the claims made in Giuffre's book and the newly resurfaced emails. </p><p>"While past civil litigation in the US is concluded, the new memoir revives several potential areas of concern for Andrew," she explained. "Even though he has not (as of yet) been criminally charged, the renewed scrutiny over possible misuse of police resources or attempt to gather personal information on a survivor could trigger regulatory or investigative action." </p><p>"If the monarchy faces any renewed questions about oversight, privilege, and accountability, that action might even be greenlit by palace agents," Matta added. </p><p>In addition to the emails published by the Mail on Sunday, other leaked correspondence could prove to be a liability for Andrew, according to Fitzwilliams. </p><p>On Oct. 12, The Guardian published details of an email dated Feb. 28, 2011 from Andrew to Epstein, which contradicted the royal’s prior claim that he cut contact with the disgraced financier in 2010.</p><p>"I’m just as concerned for you! Don’t worry about me! It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it," he allegedly wrote in an email sent to Epstein. "Otherwise keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!"</p><p>The leaked emails published by the Mail on Sunday emerged days after Andrew announced that he had relinquished his royal titles and honors due to the accusations connecting him with Epstein. </p><p>"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family," Andrew's statement read. "I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life."</p><p>"With His Majesty’s agreement, we feel I must now go a step further," the statement continued. "I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me."</p><p>While he will no longer be referred to as the Duke of York, Prince Andrew remains a prince as he is the son of the late Queen Elizabeth. His Royal Highness title has been inactive since 2019 when he stepped down from royal duties. </p><p>However, former royal photographer Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that he could face further consequences. </p><p>"There is a rule in royal circles if a disruptive event lasts for more than seven days further action should be taken to quell the negativity attached," he said. </p><p>"No doubt the royals hoped that with Andrew voluntarily removing his titles that would be punishment enough, but more people are baying for blood with politicians seeking a legal resolve of title removals, Metropolitan police investigating the allegations of trying to use his security staff in establishing any scandals attached to Guiffre and the fact living in luxury in the 30 bedroom Royal Lodge at Windsor should still be allowed." </p><p>Both Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson currently reside at Royal Lodge, which is owned by the royal family and located in Windsor Great Park, about three miles south of Windsor Castle in Berkshire, England.</p><p>"The optics of their continuing residence at 30-bedroom Royal Lodge is truly terrible," Fitzwilliams told Fox News Digital. </p><p>Giuffre's memoir is set for release on Oct. 21 and Fitzwilliams described its publication as a "worldwide event."</p><p>"Tragically, she died in April but her thoughts and experiences will live on in her memory to show abuse can be fought, but at a terrible cost," he added. </p><p>Turner pointed out that the book's publication could be a significant distraction during an important week for Andrew's brother King Charles III and his nephew Prince William.</p><p>"King Charles is making a historic journey to visit the Pope and kneel in prayer with him, a ceremony which has not happened for centuries. Early next month William is traveling to Brazil for Cop 30 to talk about his Earthshot prize, all these important issues by the royal family are being overshadowed by Andrew," he said. </p><p>Fitzwilliams pointed out that the accusations in the memoir will most likely further damage Andrew's already tarnished reputation and result in social exile for the prince and Ferguson. </p><p>"The quotes I have seen compound the insights we have already had into the character of Prince Andrew, who denies all the charges against him and has not been convicted of anything," Fitzwilliams said. </p><p>"However, unable to use his titles, stripped of his patronages and an outcast in the royal family, he and his devoted ex-wife Sarah Ferguson face the future as pariahs."</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Lauryn Overhultz and Christina Dugan Ramirez contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Virginia’s obscene spectacle of a Democrat ‘mom’ candidate who isn’t family friendly</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Abigail Spanberger, the Virginia Democrat gubernatorial candidate, really wants voters to know she has three daughters, and that should scare every Virginia mother and father straight to the polls. </p><p>The girl mom crosses her heart that she’ll put families first, even though she refuses to pull her endorsement from attorney general candidate Jay Jones, who dreamed of putting bullets in a former Virginia House Speaker and watching his children die.  </p><p>Maybe she isn’t talking about putting the speaker’s family first.  </p><p>And even if Virginia kids have been collateral damage as a result of the irresponsible policies she supports — she definitely isn’t talking about putting those families first. </p><p>In 2024, Richard Cox, a now 58-year-old man, allegedly exposed himself to women and children throughout northern Virginia, after he was allowed to share locker rooms with them simply because he calls himself a woman — even though he’s a registered sex offender. </p><p>At a northern Virginia high school in September, a 14-year-old girl told a teacher a boy was lurking in the girls’ locker room, watching girls change. The teacher’s response — too bad. </p><p>As of the filing of a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights for violating Title IX, the high school’s solution — they told the girl to change faster. Their priority is accommodating the boy who wants to undress with girls. </p><p>I’m old enough to remember when schools actually protected kids. </p><p>This summer, school officials at a Fairfax County, Virginia high school were exposed in an egregiously unethical and underhanded scandal for allegedly bankrolling, on the taxpayer dime, an abortion for a minor and attempting to do the same for another student — without parental consent. The message — we’re in charge of your kids. </p><p>The same schools won’t give kids Tylenol without sending an email to parents.  </p><p>When asked about the abortion scandal, instead of putting families first, Spanberger stammered about Virginia’s low math scores.  </p><p>Maybe because gender indoctrination of children plus sex obsession with kids doesn’t equal winning at math. No education degree required — you’re welcome.  </p><p>In 2021, a boy dressed like a girl raped a ninth grader in a northern Virginia school bathroom. The school blatantly denied it, and the superintendent worked overtime to cover it up. The school’s top priority was saving its transgender bathroom policy — the current public school religion. </p><p>Mission accomplished, the policy was safe, even if our kids weren’t. While the superintendent was eventually fired, the boy moved to another school in the district. Guess what happened — he assaulted another girl. </p><p>In Orwellian fashion, the rape victim’s dad, Scott Smith, was arrested and carted out of a school board meeting by police as if he was the criminal.  </p><p>Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin pardoned Smith after he was elected, however Spanberger thinks the boy had every right to be in the bathroom with Smith’s daughter. </p><p>It was only a few years ago the #MeToo movement told us we were supposed to believe all women, no questions asked. Now, it’s as if the pendulum has swung so far in the other direction that we’re supposed to believe no girls, no questions asked.  </p><p>While Spanberger has largely taken a vow of silence on the consequences of the disastrous policies she pushes that violate women and girls — minus a few garbled word salads she was forced to choke out — her votes speak for themselves. </p><p>Not only did she vote against the "Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act," she voted for hiding child gender transitions from parents, while schools encourage them.  </p><p>She also voted for the anything-but-equal "Equality Act," which disregards our daughters and sets them back decades by letting men encroach on and violate their most sacred spaces. Since there’s a fancy name on it, she’s hoping you’re too dumb to notice. </p><p>When pressed to answer whether girls should be forced to get naked in front of boys, it resulted in an excruciating nearly three-minute, incoherent ramble about rotational grazing practices, sounding like something out of the Kamala school of communications. </p><p>Know when to land the plane, Abby. </p><p>Other times, when pressed, she had her staff run interference and stop questions. The moratorium on her vow of silence abruptly ended, as her salad apparently ran out of words. </p><p>Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy likes to say the Republican strategy for dealing with Democrats in Congress is "operation let them speak."  </p><p>When you let people talk long enough, you learn what they really think. For Spanberger, even when she speaks, she’s silent on putting Virginia families first. </p><p>German pastor and anti-Nazi activist Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, "Silence in the face of evil is itself evil." </p><p>Throughout Virginia, our children have been victims of unnecessary evil as a result of policies she supports, and Spanberger — the mom running for governor — has been silent on all of it.  </p><p>While Spanberger has used the reprehensible and irresponsible rhetoric, "let your rage fuel you," to provoke voters, it tells you all you need to know about why she won’t put any daylight between her and Jay Jones. </p><p>Common sense Virginia voters will let our rage fuel us, but we’ll do it peacefully — all the way to the voting booth. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">LIZ PEEK: Democrat fury fuels 'No Kings' protests but endgame is elusive</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Millions of Americans turned out across the country last Saturday for the "No Kings" rallies, protesting, according to the New York Times, a president that the crowds view as "acting like a monarch."</p><p>The success of the protests, however, denies their case. A monarch would have attempted to disperse the crowds or put important meeting sites off-limits. A monarch would not have gone about conducting the business of state while people dressed in goofy costumes banged drums and hurled vile insults at his head.  A monarch… would not have been elected by a majority of the nation.</p><p>The crowd size should impress no one. The protests were driven by labor unions like the American Federation of Teachers, which claims almost 3 million members and the AFL-CIO, which claims 15 million.   </p><p>Fair-minded Americans should wonder what exactly are the Trump White House policies that have people so riled up?</p><p>Are Americans angry that President Donald Trump has taken on the drug cartels which have flooded our nation with fentanyl and other deadly substances that have killed hundreds of thousands of our young people?</p><p>Are Americans protesting the securing of our southern border, no longer allowing millions of undocumented people to illegally crowd our cities’ schools and hospital emergency rooms?</p><p>Do voters oppose shrinking the size of our federal bureaucracy, attempting to bring the outlandish spending engineered by President Joe Biden under control?</p><p>Is it Trump’s efforts to turn our education establishment on its head, demanding better performance for the Black and brown kids who are not being taught to read?</p><p>And what about crime? Are most Americans unhappy that the president is trying to bring our dangerous cities, like Chicago, under control?</p><p>The answer to all these questions is no. Polling shows most Americans agree with the tough policies that President Trump has adopted on crime, immigration and trimming the federal government.</p><p>Most of the country, in addition, is thrilled that the Trump White House has negotiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, however fragile, and brought the hostages home.  It is hard to find anyone who was unhappy that the president commanded the destruction of Iran’s nuclear weapons.</p><p>And Trump’s efforts to bring manufacturing back to the United States have brought him acclaim from labor unions who stand to benefit from those changes. Surely most voters back a production renaissance in our country.</p><p>What has really riled Democrats is that we have a president willing, even eager, to expose the pervasive corruption and dishonesty of their party. </p><p>President Trump, along with Elon Musk, revealed the complex of tax-payer supported NGOs that support Democrat candidates and causes; NGOs, described by Musk as "fake charities," funded by the very billionaires whom Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., rails against. </p><p>Billionaires like those who supposedly threw millions of dollars into promoting the No Kings rallies, like The Arabella Network, the Soros network, the Tides Foundation and many others. </p><p>The Trump White House is also delving into the swamp, disclosing the political origins of the Russiagate hoax, the efforts of the Biden administration and media pals to censor the opposition, and Biden’s diversion of government spending to favored left-wing allies. </p><p>Biden assigned long-time Clinton apparatchik John Podesta to distribute hundreds of billions of dollars included in the Inflation Reduction Act that was meant to fund climate initiatives. Trump’s EPA head Lee Zeldin exposed the "Biden Administration’s scheme to quickly park $20 billion outside the agency…we suspected that some organizations were created out of thin air just to take advantage of this." Yes, like a group affiliated with left-wing political activist and serial election loser Stacey Abrams.</p><p>Democrats are also angry that President Trump won reelection in spite of an all-out legal assault meant to make him unelectable. They are also angry that, in spite of Vice President Kamala Harris enjoying a war chest of well over a billion dollars, Democrats were not only denied the Oval Office but also both houses of Congress. It is an election outcome that has allowed the GOP to investigate the malfeasance of people like former FBI Director James Comey, who was up to his neck in the Russiagate affair.</p><p>Democrat leaders like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., are furious that their party is on the ropes, increasingly directed by far-left candidates who do not reflect America’s values. They know that Trump currently occupies the middle of the policy spectrum. He is winning on issues like opposing transgender people competing in women’s sports and on banning DEI, which is unpopular.</p><p>In Michigan, local No Kings organizers claimed they were objecting to sending immigration agents into cities, pushing for the redrawing of congressional maps to favor Republicans and "gutting health care." To be sure, the aggressive rounding up of people in the country illegally is controversial. But, sending National Guard to protect federal property and law enforcement officials should not be. Meanwhile, the only thing new about the redistricting battles is that the GOP has wised up and is finally countering long-time gerrymandering by Democrats. As far as "gutting health care," that is an issue before Congress, not the Trump White House.   </p><p>Some question the legality of Trump’s attacks on alleged drug runners from Venezuela, or to impose tariffs on our trading partners. His critics should be calmed by the intervention of the judiciary. Most of us have lost track of the number of lawsuits wending their way to the Supreme Court. It’s not very king-like to have to answer to judges.</p><p>Asked about the "No Kings" rallies, the president said, "I’m not a king, I work my a** off to make our country great." </p><p>And that is what is making Democrats crazy. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">MORNING GLORY: Hey New York City Republicans, vote for Cuomo for mayor</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>If Republicans in New York City vote in large numbers for former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for mayor between October 25 and November 4, the greatest city in the world will avoid a plunge into a spiral of collapse on many fronts.</p><p>New York City is home to 8.5 million people. 4.7 million of them are active registered voters and over another 700,000 are "inactive" voters.  </p><p>Democratic Party registrants make up the largest bloc, at nearly two-thirds of the electorate. Unaffiliated voters are the second-largest group, accounting for 21.1% of registered voters. Republican Party registrants make up a mere 11.0%. </p><p>New York City employs "ranked choice voting," which led to a final result in the Democratic primary of 573,169 votes for Zohran Mamdani and 443,229 votes for Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>Curtis Sliwa ran unopposed for the GOP nomination. (Sliwa was the GOP nominee in the 2021 NYC mayoral election and got blown out by Democratic nominee Eric Adams, with Adams receiving 753,801 votes and Sliwa receiving 313,385.)</p><p>In the GOP primary for the nomination for mayor that year, Sliwa received 40,794 votes to the 16,719 votes that businessman Fernando Mateo received.</p><p>Even an eighth grader with decent math skills should be able to recognize that Sliwa cannot win. It is not possible. There aren’t enough Republicans for Sliwa to even be competitive.</p><p>But, Sliwa can hand the leadership of the world’s greatest city to Mamdani, who is, in my opinion, an obvious anti-Semitic communist. Reasonable and even activist, hard-core conservative Republicans should hold their noses and vote for Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>Cuomo is nobody’s idea of a stellar candidate, or even one remotely close to the values of small government and lower taxes combined with excellent police and local schools.</p><p>New York is already a high-tax state with the state income tax beginning at 4% and rising to 10.9%, on top of which comes the NYC income tax of between 3.078% and 3.876%. Thus, the highest earners in the City already pay 14.776% on their incomes in state and city taxes. Mamdani wants to raise that rate to 16.8%, by far the highest in the country. Mamdani also wants to "de-commodify" housing.</p><p>"If we want to end the housing crisis, the solution has to be moving toward the full de-commodification of housing," Mamdani says. "In other words, moving away from the status quo in which most people access housing by purchasing it on the market and toward a future where we guarantee high quality housing to all as a human right." In other, "other words," public housing for millions more New Yorkers.</p><p>Demographics are not going to be decisive in this election: Approximately 10% of New Yorkers are Muslim, 14% are Jewish and 30-35% Catholic. Mamdani’s refusal to reject "Globalize the Intifada" rhetoric should guarantee most of the "Jewish vote" goes to Cuomo, while Mamdani is likely to draw a super-majority of Muslims who would like to see one of their co-religionists elected mayor for the first time in the city’s history.</p><p>Sliwa cannot win. It’s a matter of math. There isn’t a serious political consultant who would tell you otherwise.</p><p>But Cuomo can. And should — if you care at all about America’s greatest city.</p><p>Start with the obvious. Mamdani has run a state legislator’s office, which means he has supervised about 10 employees. It’s the only job in which he has acted as "the boss." (Campaigns don’t count as they run on donors’ dollars and taxpayer funding, not a budget that must be met year in and year out.) By contrast, New York City has a payroll of more than 300,000, which includes the New York City Department of Education, NYPD, Fire Department and many other agencies.</p><p>Cuomo as governor had about 187,000 employees working for him — smaller than the employee count in New York City, but a lot closer than Mamdani’s state office staff of 10 or so.</p><p>The mayor of New York City appoints the police commissioner and the superintendent of schools. Imagine the radical Mamdani imposing his extreme views on the NYPD and the city’s public schools.</p><p>How extreme are his views? Mamdani, to cite just one example, said in an interview with The New York Times that the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, was a war criminal who was committing genocide in Gaza, adding that if the Israeli leader were to come to New York, Mamdani said he would honor a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for Mr. Netanyahu’s arrest by having him apprehended at the airport.</p><p>I’ve only lived in the city for one stretch, visit only when work requires it now, but understand its attraction for young adults and migrants. But, if they fall for electing Mamdani on the promise of free bus rides, universal child care, a rent freeze on "stabilized apartments" and the creation of city-owned grocery stores, they are in for a very rude awakening.</p><p>Public safety will be the first to suffer. In the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, Mamdani blasted the NYPD as "racist, anti-queer &amp; a major threat to public safety" and supported calls to "defund this rogue agency." Mamdani has spent the summer and early fall trying to distance himself from himself, but once a radical — it should take decades, not months, to escape the categorization.</p><p>Cuomo is hardly the face of a new generation. But, he’s also not going to send property values crashing and capital fleeing to places like Florida and Texas.</p><p>At some point — and the election of a radical like Mamdani is indeed such a tipping point — the people who can leave, do. </p><p>It was an interesting primary — an opportunity to smack down Cuomo for his many mistakes during Covid. But, this election is for keeps, not social media. At least the former governor has a clue about running a huge operation and how to find normal professionals to staff the top tier of appointments.</p><p>New York City is too important to the country to conduct a vast social studies experiment on it. Republicans, you can make a difference in the election. Don’t vote for the ruination of New York City just because you would enjoy the laughs a radical, left-wing Marxist would bring in his wake.</p><p>Republicans: Vote for Cuomo. If you try to sell your house or condo if Mamdani wins, lower the asking price in your head right now. The smart money isn’t going to stick around to watch how it doesn’t work out under Mamdani. </p><p><i>Hugh Hewitt is host of "The Hugh Hewitt Show," heard weekday mornings 6am to 9am ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

<div class="article-title">New York Times 'by far' had the worse Israel-Hamas coverage in US media, Jerusalem Post editor says</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Jerusalem Post Editor-in-Chief Zvika Klein slammed the American news media for its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, particularly The New York Times, in an interview with Fox News Digital.</p><p>Klein recalled American journalists' coverage as being "great" in the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 7 terrorist attack, emphasizing the tragedy the Jewish state endured. But it wasn't long after that the<i> "</i>Palestinian narrative became a lot more prominent."</p><p>"In the liberal media, it's been pretty bad," Klein said.</p><p>On which news organization in America he thought was the worst offender, he told Fox News Digital it was "by far" The New York Times.</p><p>"On CNN, at least you had, you had the personal interest stories, you had released hostages, hostage families. The New York Times was systematically just a very, very anti-Israel. Like, dramatically more, I would say, than any other outlet," Klein said.</p><p>The New York Times was frequently criticized for several stories it published over the course of the war, including mistakes that seemed to only flow in one direction. </p><p>The paper was among the outlets that peddled the false narrative pushed by the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry that over 500 civilians were killed by an Israeli bombing of a Gaza hospital just days after Oct. 7, running the headline "Israeli Strike Kills Hundreds in Hospital, Palestinians Say."  What actually happened was an explosion in the hospital's parking lot stemming from a misfired rocket fired by Hamas ally Islamic Jihad, resulting in a death toll a tiny fraction of what Hamas had first alleged.</p><p>The Times later admitted it had relied "too heavily" on claims by Hamas.</p><p>More recently, the Gray Lady drew backlash for plastering a grim image of a malnourished infant on its front page, but was later forced to admit that the child has a genetic disorder.</p><p>Klein cited "progressives," who overwhelmingly rallied behind the anti-Israel cause, as being a factor in the liberal media's coverage of the war and constantly framing Israel as being the "oppressor."</p><p>Klein conceded, however, that Israel had been losing the "propaganda war" and that it "failed" with its messaging on the world stage. The country has weathered intense criticism around the globe over the past two years for its prosecution of the conflict, with Israel facing accusations of war crimes and even genocide.</p><p>"We're not in a good place. It could have been managed better," Klein said. "People are concerned about the fact that there's so much negativity towards Israel. It's a real problem."</p><p>On whether he thinks Israel will regain the global support it once had, Klein replied, "I don't see it bouncing back so fast. It's going to take a while."</p><p>Throughout the war, there had been a debate among political pundits on whether anti-Zionism equates to antisemitism. To Klein, the answer was clear. </p><p>"Anti-Zionism is antisemitism because anti-Zionism means you don't believe in the right for Jews to have their own country, their own state," Klein said. "You could be critical of Israel, because I would say almost every Israeli is critical of Israel. We're not shy to say what we think, and speak out. But anti-Zionism is definitely antisemitism."</p><p>He continued, "And in the past, people would hide behind anti-Israel sentiments and not, you know, show their true colors, but now people will just say — I don't know if they would say I'm an antisemite, but they'd say I'm against Jews. You know, we see that now, and it's very concerning."</p><p>The New York Times defended its reporting in a statement to Fox News Digital. </p><p>"The New York Times helps people understand complex and politicized issues with on-the-ground, fact-based reporting of the region - that is free from outside interests," the statement said. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">SCOOP: Trump-backed former Navy SEAL launches GOP primary challenge against Massie</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>- A former longtime Navy SEAL and fifth-generation Kentucky farmer who is backed by President Donald Trump on Tuesday declared his candidacy in the state's 4th Congressional District, as he challenges Republican Rep. Thomas Massie in next year's GOP primary.</p><p>"I’ve dedicated my life to serving my country, and I’m ready to answer the call again," Ed Gallrein said in a statement shared first with Fox News Digital. </p><p>And pointing to Massie, a frequent GOP critic of the president during his second term in the White House, Gallrein emphasized, "This district is Trump Country. The President doesn’t need obstacles in Congress – he needs backup. I’ll defeat Thomas Massie, stand shoulder to shoulder with President Trump, and deliver the America First results Kentuckians voted for."</p><p>The campaign launch comes four days after Trump took to social media to praise Gallrein, urge him to run, and blast Massie.</p><p>Trump argued that Massie was a "Third Rate Congressman," a "Weak and Pathetic RINO," and a "totally ineffective LOSER who has failed us so badly."</p><p>And the president applauded Gallrein, calling him a "Brave Combat Veteran" and a "very successful Businessman" who, if elected to Congress, would "fight tirelessly to Keep our now very Secure Border, SECURE, Stop Migrant Crime, and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment."</p><p>Trump's social media post included a photo of himself and Gallrein holding red MAGA hats in the Oval Office.</p><p>Gallrein served three decades in uniform, rising to the rank of Captain. According to his campaign bio, he served multiple times on SEAL Team SIX, deploying to Panama, Afghanistan, and Iraq, and earned four Bronze Stars and two Presidential Unit Citations.</p><p>His campaign release also highlighted that "Gallrein’s roots run deep in Kentucky." He was born and raised in the state. And his family, which has farmed for over a century, built Kentucky's largest dairy farm and Gallrein Grain Farms, one of the state's largest grain operations.</p><p>Massie took aim at Gallrein following Trump's social media endorsement, calling him a "failed candidate and establishment hack," as he pointed to Gallrein's unsuccessful run last year for the state Senate.</p><p>"After having been rejected by every elected official in the 4th District, Trump’s consultants clearly pushed the panic button with their choice of failed candidate and establishment hack Ed Gallrein," Massie said in a statement to Politico. "Ed’s been begging them to pick him for over three months now."</p><p>Trump started targeting Massie for ouster earlier this year over the seven-term lawmaker's opposition to the "One Big Beautiful Bill," which passed the GOP-controlled Congress early in the summer nearly entirely along party lines. The sweeping GOP megalaw is the president's major legislative achievement since returning to the White House.</p><p>Massie is also leading the push, along with Democratic Rep.

<div class="article-title">Texas finds thousands of illegal immigrants registered to vote on state voter rolls</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Texas election review has identified thousands of illegal immigrants on the state's voter rolls, Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson said Monday.</p><p>Nelson said a crosscheck of state voter records found that more than 2,700 possible illegal immigrants were registered on the voter rolls, leading to an eligibility review across the 254 counties.</p><p>The data came from a full comparison of Texas’s 18 million registered voters against federal citizenship records in the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ SAVE database, according to the Secretary of State's office.</p><p>"Only eligible United States citizens may participate in our elections," Nelson said. "The Trump Administration’s decision to give states free and direct access to this data set for the first time has been a game changer, and we appreciate the partnership with the federal government to verify the citizenship of those on our voter rolls and maintain accurate voter lists."</p><p>The investigation showed after running the SAVE crosscheck, that state officials could identify 2,724 potential noncitizens whose voter files have been sent to local counties to be further investigated.</p><p>This process falls under Chapter 16 of the Texas Election Code, which requires counties to verify each voter's eligibility and remove confirmed noncitizens from the rolls.</p><p>Nelson said the review is part of an effort to maintain an accurate voter list and to safeguard election integrity ahead of the 2026 election cycle.</p><p>"Everyone’s right to vote is sacred and must be protected," Nelson said. "We encourage counties to conduct rigorous investigations to determine if any voter is ineligible – just as they do with any other data set we provide."</p><p>Each flagged voter will receive a notice from their county registrar giving them 30 days to provide proof of U.S. citizenship. If a voter does not respond, their registration will be canceled, though it can be reinstated immediately once proof of citizenship is provided. </p><p>Nelson's statement said confirmed noncitizens who voted in previous Texas elections will be referred to the Attorney General's Office for further review and potential prosecution. </p><p>The announcement comes amid growing national scrutiny of voter rolls as several states – including Georgia, Arizona, and Florida – have conducted similar audits of voter eligibility.</p><p>Republican Governor Greg Abbott said that since Senate Bill 1 was signed into law, Texas has removed more than one million ineligible or outdated registrations from the state’s voter rolls, calling the effort essential to safeguard Texans' right to vote.</p><p>"These reforms have led to the removal of over one million ineligible people from our voter rolls in the last three years, including noncitizens, deceased voters, and people who moved to another state," Abbott said. "The Secretary of State and county voter registrars have an ongoing legal requirement to review the voter rolls, remove ineligible voters, and refer any potential illegal voting to the Attorney General’s Office and local authorities for investigation and prosecution. Illegal voting in Texas will never be tolerated. We will continue to actively safeguard Texans’ sacred right to vote while also aggressively protecting our elections from illegal voting."</p><p>Abbott has called the initiative proof that Texas is "leading the nation in election integrity."</p><p>A breakdown of the information was released by the Secretary of State’s office showing Harris County with the largest number of potential noncitizens at 362, followed by Dallas County (277), Bexar County (201), and El Paso County (165).Smaller counties, including Andrews, Llano, and Cooke, reported fewer than ten flagged registrations.</p><p>In total, all 254 Texas counties were included in the SAVE database review. Counties began sending verification notices this week as part of the 30-day review process. </p><p>In June, Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson announced that she had referred to the Office of Attorney General to investigate the names of 33 potential noncitizens who voted in the November 2024 General Election. </p><p>The statement released by Nelson said the referral came within weeks of Texas gaining access to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service’s SAVE Database.  </p><p>"Gaining access to this database has been a game-changer. Not only have we been able to identify individuals who should not have voted in the last election, we have also been able to confirm naturalization of dozens more," Secretary Nelson said. </p><p>The crosscheck was made possible after the Trump Administration granted states direct and free access to the federal SAVE database for the first time.</p><p>The tool allows election officials to confirm voter citizenship against immigration and naturalization records.</p><p>The statement also said Texas was among the first states to join a pilot program with DHS, USCIS, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to improve the database's functionality. </p><p>"We are in the early stages of this pilot program, but we already see promising results. This may be the most current and accurate data set there is when it comes to citizenship verification," Secretary Nelson said.  </p><p>County registrars are expected to complete their investigations by early December, with official removals and potential referrals to follow.</p><p>The Secretary of State's office said the review will continue with periodic checks against federal databases to ensure accuracy. </p><p>"The SAVE database has proven to be a critically important data set and one of many that we will continue to use in Texas to ensure that only qualified voters cast a ballot in our elections," Nelson said.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump commutes George Santos’ sentence, pardon blitz wipes out costly federal investigations</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>When George Santos walked out of prison after serving less than three months of his sentence, he took a remaining chunk of law enforcement credibility with him.</p><p>The expelled ex-congressman, whose 7-year sentence was commuted by President Trump, isn’t just a clownish liar who invented wild stories about himself. He is a scam artist who cost his victims plenty of money, and then pleaded guilty.</p><p>But there is a much larger question about the Trump Justice Department and whether vast sums being used to investigate his political enemies also includes the use of his pardon power to let favored crooks, mostly Republicans, off the legal hook. </p><p>On the offensive end, the president has ordered investigations of such political foes as James Comey and Letitia James – both of whom were indicted by a loyalist when the professional prosecutor was fired for insisting there was insufficient evidence – along with Adam Schiff and George Soros.</p><p>On the defensive end, Trump already pardoned Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and Charles Kushner (Jared’s father) at the end of his first term. And pardoned the Jan. 6 rioters when he regained the White House.</p><p>In fairness, Joe Biden handed out lots of last-minute preemptive pardons to protect his allies from Trump, including, of course, his son Hunter.</p><p>But here’s the thing. DOJ spent many thousands of dollars investigating Santos, gathering evidence and bringing it before a grand jury.</p><p>The ex-lawmaker fraudulently claimed unemployment benefits.</p><p>He diverted money from his donors for personal expenses, charging $11,000 from one victim’s credit card for designer clothing from Hermes and Sephora, cosmetics, OnlyFans purchases and, not surprisingly, Botox. For him, Botox was probably the most important expense.</p><p>So the entire investigation was a waste of money, given the get-out-of-jail-free card he was handed at the end.</p><p>He claimed to have been a star volleyball player at a college he never attended. He claimed he ran a pet charity (false) and raised money for surgery on a service dog, which wasn’t really sick. </p><p>He claimed his mother was killed in the World Trade Center on 9/11. He claimed his Jewish grandparents fled the Nazis, but records show they were living in Brazil; he later insisted he’d never said he was Jewish. He claimed to own 13 properties and have a $750,000 salary, both untrue. He claimed he had produced the Spider-Man flop on Broadway. </p><p>Most importantly, he claimed to have worked for Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, which said there was no record of him having been there – a false claim meant to give him street cred in raising money.</p><p>Santos became a national punchline. But it was no joke in the House, where more than 100 Republicans joined the Democrats in ousting him at the end of 2023. </p><p>Another Trump tactic is to slam the brakes on existing investigations, depending on his political preferences, which retroactively turn these probes into an exercise in futility. And that can include Democrats.</p><p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams, some of whose top aides had been convicted, was under indictment on corruption charges related to Turkey when Trump took office. Adams had supported Trump on illegal immigration, and the president shut down the probe – again, rendering the law enforcement efforts a waste of taxpayer money.</p><p>Trump also pardoned former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who was serving a 14-year sentence for trying to sell Barack Obama’s old Senate seat in a shakedown attempt. The president had commuted his sentence in the first term. </p><p>But back to Santos. While the New York Times exposed much of Santos’ false resume, by that time he’d already been elected as a congressman from Long Island.</p><p>But a local paper, the North Shore Leader, had exposed him before the election.</p><p>"We all smelled a fake," Publisher Grant Lally told PBS’s "NewsHour," adding: "We knew Santos was a fraud."</p><p>It was "very disappointing" that no one picked up the scoop before the election. "We did send the paper out to a lot of the local organs, a lot of the media."</p><p>I wish he’d sent it to me. The excuse was the national press was busy with other New York stories. </p><p>I’ve never met Santos and have nothing against him. He simply became a national embarrassment.</p><p>Santos got Trump’s attention in part by writing a column on prison life for Long Island’s South Shore Press. Trump said the convicted fabulist had been held in solitary confinement for long stretches and "horribly mistreated." </p><p>One rap against Santos is that he has never showed much remorse.</p><p>On CNN’s "State of the Union" Sunday, he said: "People are going to hate me. It doesn’t matter whoever gets clemency in the future, whoever that person might be. I’m pretty confident that if President Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ off of the cross, he would have had critics. So that’s just the reality of our country."</p><p>Geez.</p><p>When the story of his serial fabrications first broke, former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, now director of national intelligence, sharply questioned Santos during a Fox interview, demanding:</p><p>"Do you have no shame?"</p><p>The question still hangs in the air.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Seattle Seahawks defended their home turf on "Monday Night Football," dominating the Houston Texans on the way to a 27-19 victory. </p><p>Seattle improved to 5-2 on the season, while the Texans, fresh off a bye week, fall to 2-4. </p><p>Sam Darnold and the Seahawks’ offense got off to a roaring start in the first quarter, scoring two touchdowns on their first three drives as Zach Charbonnet and Jaxon Smith-Njigba found pay dirt once again this season. </p><p>Meanwhile, C.J. Stroud and the Texans’ offense couldn’t get a single thing going all night against this dynamic Seahawks defense. The first four drives for Stroud ended in punts, with no more than five plays ran in any of them. </p><p>Surprisingly, both teams went into halftime with a one-score game, as the Texans were able to convert on two field goals before the second quarter clock hit zero to make it 14-6. </p><p>Then, in the second half, disaster struck for the Seahawks when Darnold was strip-sacked by Will Anderson Jr. in the end zone and the ball was recovered by the Texans for a much-needed touchdown. The two-point try was unsuccessful, but at 17-12, the game was within reach if Houston could figure something out on defense. </p><p>However, Darnold led the Seahawks to another field goal in the third quarter, and Stroud turned the ball over on downs, which led to this game getting out of hand. </p><p>The fourth-down try was on Houston’s own 41-yard line, and Darnold flipped the field with a 19-yard pass to Smith-Njigba to get in the red zone. A few plays later, Charbonnet added another short run for a score to make it 27-12. </p><p>The Texans’ defense kept trying to keep their team in the game, including their fourth turnover of the game as Derek Stingley Jr. intercepted Darnold. But, even when the Texans were at Seattle’s 3-yard line, they were unable to score a touchdown as the Seahawks’ defense remained relentless. </p><p>But Stroud was finally able to get a red zone trip that ended up with a touchdown, as he found running back Woody Marks to make it 27-19. It wasn’t enough time for Houston, though, as the Seahawks got the job done in the end. </p><p>Looking at the box score, Smith-Njigba had yet another 100-plus-yard game, tallying eight catches for 123 yards with his touchdown to lead the game. And while Charbonnet scored the two touchdowns, Kenneth Walker III added 66 yards on 17 carries on his birthday. </p><p>For the Texans, Nico Collins left the game early with a head injury, finishing with only four catches for 27 yards on 10 targets. It was tight end Dalton Schultz picking up the slack with nine catches for 98 yards.</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>For the first time since 1993, the Toronto Blue Jays are heading to the World Series. </p><p>And they can thank the man who has won one for the chance. </p><p>In the bottom of the seventh inning, with runners on second and third with nobody out, George Springer stepped to the plate with the chance to tie a 3-1 ball game in favor of the Seattle Mariners, a team desperate for its first-ever World Series appearance in franchise history. </p><p>Springer decided to do one better, sitting on a fastball from Eduard Bazardo and launching it over the left field fence to take a 4-3 lead. That was the swing needed for the Blue Jays to cement their American League pennant victory. </p><p>The Blue Jays will now face the reigning-champion Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the World Series on Friday night. </p><p>This was a series filled with theatrics from the very start, but the Blue Jays found themselves heading back home down 3-2 in the series and needing two straight victories to be crowned pennant winners. They made that happen on Sunday night, as Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Addison Barger delivered home runs to force a win-or-go-home Game 7. </p><p>But Monday night didn’t start the way Toronto would’ve liked, as Josh Naylor put Seattle ahead early with an RBI single to score Julio Rodriguez. However, Daulton Varsho, who has been another clutch Blue Jays hitter throughout the postseason, smacked a single to center to score Springer to knot the game at one apiece. </p><p>Then, in the top of the third inning, Rodriguez got the Mariners back on top, belting a solo home run to deep left center field. And who other than Cal Raleigh, the AL MVP hopeful, coming through when his team needed him with a solo home run himself to make it a 3-1 ball game in the top of the fifth inning. </p><p>With the Mariners’ pitching staff being one of the best in baseball all year, there were options for who to deploy late in the game considering it was an all-hands-on-deck situation. Mariners manager Dan Wilson went with Bryan Woo after George Kirby gave him four innings, and Woo gave him clean fifth and sixth innings. </p><p>But Woo opened the door with a walk to Barger to begin the seventh inning, and Isiah Kiner-Falefa woke up Rogers Centre with a single that left runners on first and second with nobody out. After Andres Gimenez moved them over with a sacrifice bunt, Bazardo came in to face Springer. </p><p>Springer came out on top. </p><p>Jeff Hoffman finished off the Mariners in the ninth inning, striking out all three batters, including Rodriguez, to start the celebration. </p><p>The Blue Jays are hoping they can do what that team did in 1993, as the Toronto team secured back-to-back World Series titles that season.</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The World Heavyweight Championship was vacated on Monday after WWE Raw general manager Adam Pearce announced that Seth Rollins suffered an injury in Australia.</p><p>Rollins came out on top in a champion vs. champion matchup for the Crown Jewel Championship against Cody Rhodes at the Crown Jewel premium live event. On the "Monday Night Raw" after the event, Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed levied an attack on Rollins.</p><p>Paul Heyman suggested Rollins was dealing with a shoulder injury.

Baker Mayfield was earning talk about being a candidate for the MVP, but also had to deal with injuries to two of his weapons in Mike Evans and Emeka Egbuka.</p><p>Detroit opened the game with a touchdown pass from Jared Goff to Amon-Ra St. Brown.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson allegedly brought her daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, to visit Jeffrey Epstein after he was released from jail in 2009, according to a report, citing leaked emails.</p><p>According to emails seen by the Mail on Sunday, Epstein messaged his lawyer, Paul Tweed, in April 2011 claiming Ferguson "was the first" to celebrate his release from jail with her "two daughters in tow."</p><p>In the summer of 2009, Epstein was released from a Florida jail after being sentenced to 18 months, following convictions for soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution. </p><p>A source told People that Eugenie and Beatrice never met Epstein. Another source told The Telegraph that neither Ferguson nor her daughters remember visiting Epstein after his release from jail.</p><p>The alleged email exchange came a month after Ferguson did an interview with the London Evening Standard in March 2011, issuing a "heartfelt apology" for accepting money from Epstein and claiming she wanted "nothing ever to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again."</p><p>The Mail on Sunday reported that Epstein emailed his lawyer, stating Ferguson "should affirmatively state that she was misquoted."</p><p>"[Sarah] took apartments in New York. She was the first to celebrate my release with her two daughters in tow. She visited me with [a] policeman sitting at my front desk. She has asked for help with her charities," Epstein reportedly wrote at the time.</p><p>Ferguson has admitted to accepting money from Epstein in the past, but the Mail on Sunday's new reporting suggests that Ferguson had asked Epstein for more.</p><p>"Is there any chance I could borrow 50 or 100,000 US dollars to help get through the small bills that are pushing me over? Had to ask," Ferguson allegedly asked Epstein via email, according to the Mail on Sunday.</p><p>The outlet reported that at the time of the request, Epstein was under house arrest following his release from jail and his bank accounts were being monitored. He reportedly did not complete the request and wrote Ferguson back: "You need to address these issues. You are great."</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Ferguson, Beatrice and Eugenie's representatives for comment.</p><p>Last month, leaked emails circulated of Ferguson calling Epstein a "supreme friend," which prompted multiple charities to drop her as a patron. </p><p>"Following the information shared this weekend on the Duchess of York's correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein, Julia's House has taken the decision that it would be inappropriate for her to continue as a patron of the charity," a spokesperson for Julia's House, a children's hospice organization, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "We have advised the Duchess of York of this decision and thank her for her past support."</p><p>According to The Associated Press, Ferguson has also been dropped by the Teenage Cancer Trust and Natasha Allergy Research Foundation. Prevent Breast Cancer also announced they had dropped the duchess as patron.</p><p>The British Heart Foundation also dropped the duchess as the charity's ambassador, according to the BBC. The Children's Literacy Charity cut ties with Ferguson as well, the outlet reported. </p><p>In the alleged email, Ferguson referred to the disgraced sex offender as a "steadfast, generous and supreme friend."</p><p>"I know you feel hellaciously let down by me from what you were either told or read and I must humbly apologise to you and your heart for that," Ferguson allegedly wrote. </p><p>"I was advised, in no uncertain terms, to have nothing to do with you and to not speak or email you and if I did I would cause more problems to you, [Prince Andrew] and myself," she continued. "I was instructed to act with the utmost speed if I would have any chance of holding on to my career as a children’s book author and a children’s philanthropist."</p><p>In a statement to The Guardian, a representative for Ferguson said she stood by her public condemnation of Epstein. </p><p>"Like many people, she was taken in by [Epstein’s] lies. As soon as she was aware of the extent of the allegations against him, she not only cut off contact but condemned him publicly, to the extent that he then threatened to sue her for defamation for associating him with pedophilia," the statement read. "She does not resile from anything she said then. This email was sent in the context of advice the duchess was given to try to assuage Epstein and his threats."</p><p>On Oct. 17, Andrew released a statement shortly after excerpts were published from an upcoming posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who has alleged she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein and had sex with Andrew when she was 17.</p><p>"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family," a statement released by the royal, and obtained by Fox News Digital, read. "I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life."</p><p>"With His Majesty’s agreement, we feel I must now go a step further," the statement continued. "I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me."</p><p>Queen Elizabeth gave Andrew the title Duke of York when he married Ferguson in 1986. Ferguson became the Duchess of York even after their divorce in 1996. People reported that Ferguson has been going by her legal name for years now and will continue to do so now that Andrew's title has been stripped. The outlet reported that their daughters, Princess Beatrice and Prince Eugenie's titles, will remain intact.</p></body></div></body></html>

I’m just heartbroken for her right now."</p><p>Stamos "really tried to be there" for his former co-star during the scandal, and claimed that Giannulli was "a terrible narcissist."</p><p>"I’m not going to debate whether she had much to do with it or not. I know she didn’t," he said before claiming Giannulli "dragged her through that."</p><p>"She’s not a liar. She’s a saint," Stamos said before remembering he called to check on Loughlin when the scandal news broke. She allegedly told him that "Mossimo handles all that stuff."</p><p>Loughlin served nearly three months in prison and Giannulli served five months behind bars. They were released in December 2020 and April 2021. </p><p>"She goes to f--ing prison for this a--hole for three months, right? And he goes for whatever," Stamos said. "And in typical Lori fashion, I said, ‘How was it?’ She goes, ‘You know, I met a lot of nice ladies in there. We have a book club.'"</p><p>He continued, "She didn’t deserve to be dragged through that … I know for a fact it was all him."</p><p>Stamos admitted that Loughlin was "just devastated" to split up with her husband of 27 years. </p><p>"For a girl who, you know, has lived her life really well, [is] a good person, a good mother, a good wife," he said. "I know all this for a fact. To be thrown into, now, this separation and exploding, blowing up her family this way. And I just hate to see her go through this."</p><p>When asked about cheating allegations, Stamos was "taking a fifth," but noted, "Whatever he did to her, it busted her up to the core."</p><p>Loughlin recently made light of the scandal when she played a version of herself in an episode of "Curb Your Enthusiasm." In the episode, main character Larry David helps the actress get into a country club when she’s bogged down with her legal drama. </p><p>Her character also has a fake handicapped license plate and cheats at golf. </p><p>In an interview with First for Women last year, Loughlin talked about perseverance. </p><p>"Every day, we’re met with different obstacles. But, for me, it’s like that song says, ‘I get knocked down, but I get up again,’" she said. "Nobody said life was going to be a breeze; we all make mistakes, but the important thing is to persevere."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre sparred with The Bulwark’s Tim Miller over former President Joe Biden’s interactions with the press on Monday.</p><p>Jean-Pierre appeared on "The Bulwark" podcast to promote her new memoir "Independent," which focuses on her time in the Biden administration. During the podcast, Miller criticized Biden as a poor communicator and asked her whether she ever spoke to him about his age.</p><p>Jean-Pierre said she never spoke to Biden about his age but argued that Biden communicated his ideas well "whether it broke through or not."</p><p>"He talked way less to the press than Donald Trump does," Miller pushed back. "Way less. And he wasn't out there at all. He wasn't good off the cuff. He wasn't doing press conferences. Let's just be real. Like, he didn't do events."</p><p>"But Tim, that's not true," Jean-Pierre interrupted. "Tim, you're conflating all of it. That's what you're… no, you're… first you're telling me he didn't talk well about it. Then you're telling me he didn't talk at all."</p><p>"He didn't do either. He didn't talk very often, and when he did, it wasn't very good. He sounded very old and feeble," Miller argued.</p><p>Jean-Pierre claimed that Miller wasn’t "paying attention" and insisted that Biden frequently spoke to the public.</p><p>"The president spoke to the American people a couple times a week. He traveled and did domestic travel and talked directly to the American people. We are talking about a time politically that is incredibly partisan. It is hard to break through any messaging, and it was an incumbency as well," Jean-Pierre said.</p><p>Earlier that day, Jean-Pierre defended Biden’s mental acuity on "CBS Mornings," despite several behind-the-scenes reports about the former president’s decline in health while in office.</p><p>"I saw someone who was always engaged. I saw someone who understood policy, pushed us on the policy, and also understood history," Jean-Pierre said.</p><p>As press secretary, Jean-Pierre repeatedly defended Biden’s mental health, even after his disastrous June 2024 presidential debate.</p></body></div></body></html>

The Eagles are expected to make the move official on Wednesday. </p><p>Graham, a two-time Super Bowl champion in Philadelphia, was the longest-tenured player in Eagles history when he retired following the team’s Super Bowl LIX win over the Kansas City Chiefs. </p><p>But, with the Eagles facing some depth issues on their defensive line, especially with Za’Darius Smith surprisingly announcing his own retirement midway through the year, Philadelphia is calling on an old friend to help them out. </p><p>The Eagles have just 11 sacks through seven games, which is toward the bottom of the league. Graham totaled 76.5 sacks over his career and 487 combined tackles through 206 regular-season games. He tallied 126 tackles for loss and 153 quarterback hits over his record-setting game total. </p><p>Graham not only brings the experience, but also the natural leadership experience to a franchise where he is adored. </p><p>While Smith is retired, the Eagles have seen Nolan Smith placed on the injured reserve, while Jalen Carter missed a good amount of time due to injury. Azeez Ojulari is also dealing with a knee injury. </p><p>Graham said that he would answer some questions on his "Brandon Graham Unlocked" podcast, which one would believe includes the thinking behind his decision to return. </p><p>While it was a Super Bowl-winning final season for Graham at the time, he tore his triceps which rendered him unable to play until the Super Bowl.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Singer Kenny Loggins demanded that his song be removed from a meme President Donald Trump posted on Saturday.</p><p>In a statement shared with Variety on Monday, the musician slammed Trump for using his "Danger Zone" track in an A.I.-generated post in which Trump dumped fecal matter on "No Kings" protesters from an F-18 fighter jet. </p><p>"This is an unauthorized use of my performance of ‘Danger Zone.’ Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately," Loggins said.</p><p>Trump’s meme served as a response to the "No Kings" demonstrations that occurred in multiple U.S. cities on Saturday, protesting the Trump administration’s agenda — including its federal crackdown on immigration and crime in U.S. cities.</p><p>In the A.I. video, a crown-wearing Trump flew an F-18 over "No Kings" demonstrators and dumped fecal matter onto them from the plane. In one shot from the clip, a protester — believed to be young progressive activist Harry Sisson — bore the full brunt of Trump’s payload.</p><p>Loggins’ song made famous by the movie, "Top Gun," played throughout the clip. The artist lamented that his song had become part of what he described as a divisive post.</p><p>"I can’t imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us. Too many people are trying to tear us apart, and we need to find new ways to come together," he said. "We’re all Americans, and we’re all patriotic. There is no ‘us and them’ — that’s not who we are, nor is it what we should be. It’s all of us. We’re in this together, and it is my hope that we can embrace music as a way of celebrating and uniting each and every one of us."</p><p>Sisson also commented on Trump’s meme, posting on X on Sunday: "Can a reporter please ask Trump why he posted an AI video of himself dropping poop on me from a fighter jet? That would be great, thanks."</p><p>Vice President JD Vance replied to the left-wing influencer, stating, "I’ll ask him for you Harry."</p><p>The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Keith Urban appeared to have Nicole Kidman on his mind months before their separation.</p><p>Urban, 57, returned to television screens Sunday for the premiere of "The Road," a reality television show that follows a dozen up-and-coming musicians competing for a chance to open for the musician as he tours the country.</p><p>During the series premiere, Urban performed "Straight Line" from his latest album, "High." The song kicks off Urban's 12th studio album – which was released in September 2024 – and reflects on the desire to break free from a "soul-sucking routine," he explained on Instagram last year.</p><p>"I chose it first for a lot of reasons, but particularly because I think it represents an energy and spirit that became a through line of the whole record," Urban told social media followers in February 2024. "I’m gonna cover a lot of themes, emotions and vibes on this album but a very human spirit runs through them all."</p><p>He noted that "'Straight Line' is wanting to break out of a soul-sucking routine that you might be stuck in: maybe in a relationship, a job, with creativity, with yourself...whatever it is !! It’s a message of feeling alive again and getting out from under that dark cloud."</p><p>While the episode was filmed before Kidman filed for divorce from the "Somebody Like You" singer in September, Urban discussed feeling "lonely and miserable" while on the road.</p><p>"Where do we start?

<div class="article-title">Lime growers' leader killed after complaining about cartel extortion</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A leader of lime growers in the violent western Mexican state of Michoacan was killed Monday, authorities said, after repeatedly denouncing in recent months the <span class="link">extortion demands</span> of organized crime on producers.</p><p>The Michoacan state prosecutor's office said on social platform Monday that the body of Bernardo Bravo, president of the Apatzingan Valley Citrus Producers Association, was found in his vehicle on a road in the area.</p><p>In several interviews with Mexico's Radio Formula in late September and earlier this month, Bravo denounced "organized crime's permanent commercial hijacking of any commercial activity." He said criminals' demands had become out of reach for producers who were left with no other choice but to negotiate with them.</p><p>He conceded that the federal government had made some advances against organized crime in the area, but said more had to be done to end their impunity.</p><p>Last year, the federal government sent hundreds of troops to Michoacan to protect lime growers complaining of extortion threats.</p>
<p>In August, more than half of lime packing warehouses in the lowlands of Michoacan closed temporarily after growers and distributors said they had received demands from the Los Viagras and other cartels for a cut of their income.</p><p>Limes have been a revenue stream for cartels for years in Mexico. </p><p>In 2013, lime growers founded and led Mexico's biggest vigilante movement. Cartels at the time had taken control of distribution, manipulating domestic prices for crops like avocados and limes, telling growers when they could harvest and at what price they could sell their crops.</p><p>Mexican gangs and other illegal actors have also targeted <span class="link">avocado production</span>.</p>
<h2>Cartel extortion in Mexico</h2><p>Of the various criminal groups operating in Michoacan, several were declared <span class="link">foreign terrorist organizations</span> by the Trump administration, including <span class="link">United Cartels,</span> the New Michoacan Family and the <span class="link">Jalisco New Generation Cartel</span>.</p><p>Cartels in many parts of Mexico have expanded into kidnapping and <span class="link">extortion</span> to increase their income, demanding money from residents and business owners and threatening to kidnap or kill them if they refuse.</p><p>In July, Mexico's government said it <span class="link">dismantled </span>a criminal group behind a massive extortion scheme. The gang, with ties to a major drug cartel, had operated out of the central State of Mexico, extorting companies and individuals in 14 municipalities and controlling labor unions in the construction, mining, agriculture and parcel delivery industries.</p><p>In July 2024, a fisheries industry leader who complained of drug cartel extortion and illegal fishing was <span class="link">shot to death</span> in the northern border state of Baja California. Minerva Pérez was killed just hours after she complained of widespread competition from illegal fishing.</p>
<p>Ordinary citizens are also targeted with extortion. In January 2024, a cartel in Michoacan set up its own makeshift internet antennas and told locals they had to pay to use its Wi-Fi service or they would be killed, prosecutors said. Dubbed <span class="link">"narco-antennas"</span> by local media, the cartel's system involved internet antennas set up in various towns built with stolen equipment.</p>

<div class="article-title">Ex-French leader Sarkozy declares himself "an innocent man" as he's jailed</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Paris</em> — France's former president Nicolas Sarkozy became the first previous head of a European Union state to be jailed on Tuesday, proclaiming his innocence as he entered a Paris prison. France's right-wing leader from 2007 to 2012, <span class="link">Sarkozy was found guilty last month</span> of seeking to acquire funding from Muammmar Qaddafi's Libya for the campaign that saw him elected.</p><p> AFP journalists saw the 70-year-old —   who has appealed the verdict — leave his home, and after a short drive flanked by police on motorbikes, enter the La Sante prison in the French capital.</p><p> "Welcome Sarkozy!", "Sarkozy's here," AFP reporters heard convicts shouting from their cells.</p><p> In a defiant message posted on social media as he was being transferred, Sarkozy again denied any wrongdoing.</p><p> "It is not a former president of the republic being jailed this morning, but an innocent man," he said in the post. "I have no doubt. The truth will prevail."</p>
<p>Sarkozy was <span class="link">handed a five-year jail term in September</span> for criminal conspiracy over a plan for <span class="link">late Libyan dictator Qaddafi</span> to fund his electoral campaign. <span class="link">Qaddafi was killed</span> in 2011 — the first leader killed amid the "Arab Spring" uprisings that rocked the Middle East as a number of countries with long-time dictatorial regimes faced popular revolts.</p>
<p> After his September 25 verdict, Sarkozy had said he would "sleep in prison —   but with my head held high."</p><p> Dozens of supporters and family members had stood outside the former president's home from early Tuesday, some holding up framed portraits of him.</p><p> "Nicolas, Nicolas! Free Nicolas," they shouted as he left his home, holding hands with his wife, singer Carla Bruni.</p><p> Earlier they had sung the French national anthem as neighbors looked on from their balconies.</p>
<p> "This is truly a sad day for France and for democracy," said Flora Amanou, 41.</p><h2>Sarkozy's lawyer says release request already filed</h2><p>Sarkozy's lawyer Christophe Ingrain said a request had been immediately filed for Sarkozy's release.</p><p> The Paris appeals court in theory has two months to decide whether to free him pending an appeals trial, but the delay is usually shorter.</p><p> "He will be inside for at least three weeks to a month," Ingrain said.</p>
<p>Sarkozy is the first French leader to be incarcerated since Philippe Petain, the Nazi collaborationist head of state who was jailed after World War II.</p><p> Sarkozy told Le Figaro newspaper he will be taking with him a biography of Jesus and a copy of "The Count of Monte Cristo," a novel in which an innocent man is sentenced to jail but escapes to take revenge.</p><h2>Sarkozy facing likely solitary confinement</h2><p>Sarkozy is likely to be held in a 95 square foot cell in the prison's solitary confinement wing to avoid contact with other prisoners, prison staff told AFP.</p>
<p> In solitary confinement, prisoners are allowed out of their cells for one walk a day, alone, in a small yard. Sarkozy will also be allowed visits three times a week.</p><h2> The former French presidents multiple legal woes</h2><p>Sarkozy has faced a flurry of legal woes since losing his re-election bid in 2012.</p><p> He has also been convicted in two other cases.</p><p>In one, he served a sentence for graft —   over seeking to secure favors from a judge —   under house arrest while wearing an electronic ankle tag, which was removed after several months in May.</p><p> In another, France's top court is to rule next month in a case in which he is accused of illegal campaign financing in 2012.</p><p> In the so-called "Libyan case", prosecutors said his aides, acting in Sarkozy's name, struck a deal with Qaddafi in 2005 to illegally fund his victorious presidential election bid two years later.</p><p>Investigators believe that in return, Qaddafi was promised help to restore his international image after Tripoli was blamed for the 1988 <span class="link">bombing of a passenger jet over Lockerbie</span>, Scotland, and another over Niger in 1989, killing hundreds of passengers.</p>
<p>The court convicted him of criminal conspiracy over the plan, but it did not conclude that Sarkozy received or used the funds for his campaign.</p>
<p>It acquitted him on charges of embezzling Libyan public funds, passive corruption and illicit financing of an electoral campaign.</p><p> Sarkozy had already been stripped of France's highest distinction, his Legion of Honor, following the earlier graft conviction.</p><p> Six out of 10 people in France believe the prison sentence to be "fair," according to a survey of more than 1,000 adults conducted by pollster Elabe. But Sarkozy still enjoys support on the French right and has on occasion had private meetings with President Emmanuel Macron.</p><p> Macron welcomed Sarkozy to the Elysee Palace on Friday, telling the press this week: "It was normal, on a human level, for me to receive one of my predecessors in this context."</p>

<div class="article-title">Pardoned Capitol rioter charged with threatening to murder Hakeem Jeffries</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A pardoned Capitol rioter was arrested last weekend for allegedly threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.</p><p>Court documents obtained by CBS News said Christopher Moynihan was arrested Sunday after saying in text messages that he planned to "eliminate" Jeffries when the top House Democrat spoke at an event in New York City on Monday. </p><p>Jeffries spoke at the Economic Club of New York on Monday. </p><p>According to a court filing by prosecutors in the New York state criminal case, Moynihan wrote, "Hakeem Jeffries makes a speech in a few days in NYC I cannot allow this terrorist to live."</p><p>Moynihan also allegedly stated: "Even if I am hated, he must be eliminated, I will kill him for the future."</p>
<p>Moynihan faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat, according to court filings shared by prosecutors. </p><p>Moynihan's father declined to comment on the case when reached by phone by CBS News on Monday. He said Moynihan has not yet been appointed a defense attorney. </p><p>Moynihan is scheduled to make a court appearance on Thursday in Dutchess County, New York. </p>
<p>Moynihan was pardoned by President Trump nine months ago, along with more than 1,500 other Capitol riot defendants who were granted clemency hours after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.</p>
<p>Moynihan was found guilty in August 2022 of obstructing an official proceeding, and pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor charges. He was sentenced in February 2023 to 21 months in prison.</p><p>Prosecutors described Moynihan as among the first rioters to breach police barricades and enter the Capitol grounds on January 6, 2021.</p>
<p>Moynihan was also among a smaller group of riot defendants who were on the Senate floor during the siege. Prosecutors argued in Moynihan's sentencing memorandum: "While inside, Moynihan rifled through a notebook on top of a Senator's desk, saying 'There's gotta be something in here we can f*cking use against these scumbags.'"</p><p>Prosecutors said Moynihan "occupied the dais of the Senate, joining other rioters in shouts and chanting," and didn't leave the chamber until police made him leave.</p><p>Moynihan's arrest for allegedly threatening Jeffries was made by New York State Police, according to a statement by the agency that was confirmed by a state official. The investigation was initiated by the FBI, according to state police.</p><p>A state police statement said Moynihan was arraigned in local court in Clinton, a town in New York's Hudson Valley region. He was remanded to the Dutchess County Justice and Transition Center "in lieu of $10,000 cash bail, a $30,000 bond, or an $80,000 partially secured bond."   </p><p>State police declined a request to immediately release a copy of the agency's incident report or a booking photo.</p>
<p>Moynihan is not the first pardoned Capitol rioter to be arrested on new, separate charges. But he is the first to be charged with making a violent threat against a member of Congress.</p><p>Critics of the president's blanket pardons of Jan. 6 defendants have warned about the risk of recidivism by rioters, many of whom remained defiant and unapologetic about their roles in the attack. The rioters have been defended and lionized publicly as "hostages" by Mr. Trump.</p><p>In a March 2025 floor speech, Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of Senate Democratic leadership from Illinois, listed the names of accused rioters who had been arrested again. Durbin cited the case of Matthew Huttle, who was accused of "raising a firearm at police" in early 2025 and "acknowledged he was a January 6th defendant who stormed the Capitol," according to Durbin. Huttle was fatally shot by police during the traffic stop.  </p><p>Zachary Alam, who was convicted of eight felonies for his role in the Capitol riot, was arrested weeks after his 2025 presidential pardon for allegedly breaking and entering a home near Richmond, Virginia.</p><p>Other Jan. 6 defendants have since been arrested for other alleged criminal infractions that occurred before the siege or in the years between 2021 and the pardon. </p><p>The alleged threat against Jeffries is also part of a fast-growing wave of threats against legislators. In a statement last month, Capitol Police said the number of threat investigations in 2025 had already eclipsed 14,000, more than the number of cases in all of 2024.  </p><p>The Capitol riot injured more than 140 police officers and caused millions of dollars of damage to the Capitol complex. It interrupted the certification of the electoral vote from the 2020 election and triggered the evacuation of Congress, with leadership sent to a secure, secret location.</p>
<p>Some rioters chanted to hang then-Vice President Mike Pence, threatened to kill then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and beat police officers with dozens of makeshift weapons, including bats, sticks, poles, bear spray and beams. Some were accused of carrying guns, knives and handmade weapons.</p>

<p>A United Airlines flight diverted to Salt Lake City last week after the pilots discovered a crack in one of the layers of the windshield, and a weather balloon hitting the windshield may have been what caused the crack, according to the company that owns the balloon.</p><p>The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident, told CBS News Sunday that the windscreen of United Flight 1093, which was en route Thursday from Denver to Los Angeles, was being sent to its laboratory for examination. </p><p>The multilayer windshield is designed to continue to function in case one of the layers is damaged, according to officials.</p><p>NTSB Investigators are trying to determine if something struck the windshield of the Boeing 737 mid-flight and if so, what that object was.

<div class="article-title">Ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi becomes Japan's 1st female prime minister</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Tokyo</em> — Japan's parliament elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the country's first female prime minister Tuesday, a day after her struggling party struck a coalition deal with a new partner expected to pull her governing bloc further to the right.</p><p>Takaichi replaces Shigeru Ishiba, ending a three-month political vacuum and wrangling since the Liberal Democratic Party's disastrous election loss in July. </p><p>Ishiba, who lasted only one year as prime minister, resigned with his Cabinet earlier in the day, paving the way for his successor.</p>
<p>Takaichi won 237 votes —   four more than a majority — compared to 149 won by Yoshikoko Noda, head of the largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, in the lower house, which elects the prime minister.</p><p>The LDP's off-the-cuff alliance with the Osaka-based rightwing Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin no Kai, ensured her premiership because the opposition isn't united.</p><p>Takaichi's untested alliance is still short of a majority in both houses of parliament and will need to court other opposition groups to pass any legislation — a risk that <span class="link">could make her government unstable and short-lived</span>. </p>
<p>"Political stability is essential right now," Takaichi said at Monday's signing ceremony with the JIP leader and Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura. "Without stability, we cannot push measures for a strong economy or diplomacy." </p><p>Her win points Japan to the right, including on immigration and social issues.</p><p>In addition, Takaichi faces public anger over rising prices after years of deflation. That's boosting backing for oppositions groups such as the far-right Sanseito party.</p><p>Tackling rising prices and other economic measures are the top priority for the Takaichi government, LDP Secretary General Shunichi Suzuki told NHK public television as he apologized over the delay because of the party's internal power struggle since the July election. He said the new coalition will cooperate with other opposition parties to quickly tackle rising prices to "live up to the expectations of the people."</p>
<p>The two parties signed a coalition agreement on policies underscoring Takaichi's hawkish and nationalistic views.</p><p>Their last-minute deal came after the Liberal Democrats lost its longtime partner, the Buddhist-backed Komeito, which has a more dovish and centrist stance. The breakup threatened a change of power for the LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted for decades. </p><p>Later in the day, Takaichi, 64, will present a Cabinet with a number of allies of LDP's most powerful kingmaker, Taro Aso, and others who backed her in the party leadership vote. </p><p>JIP will not hold ministerial posts in Takaichi's Cabinet until his party is confident about its partnership with the LDP, Yoshimura said. </p><p>Takaichi is running on deadline — a major policy speech later this week, <span class="link">talks with President Trump</span> and regional summits. She needs to quickly tackle rising prices and compile economy-boosting measures by late December to address public frustration. </p><p>While she is the first woman serving as Japan's prime minister, she's in no rush to promote gender equality or diversity.  </p><p>Takaichi is among Japanese politicians who have stonewalled measures for women's advancement. Takaichi supports the imperial family's male-only succession and opposes same-sex marriage and allowing separate surnames for married couples. </p>
<p>A protege of <span class="link">assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe</span> and admirer of Britain's Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is expected to emulate Abe's policies including a stronger military and economy, as well as revising Japan's pacifist constitution. With a potentially weak grip on power, it's unknown how much Takaichi will be able to achieve. </p><p>When Komeito left the governing coalition, it cited the LDP's lax response to slush fund scandals that led to their consecutive election defeats. </p><p>The centrist party also raised concern about Takaichi's revisionist view of Japan's wartime past and her <span class="link">regular prayers at Yasukuni Shrine</span> despite protests from Beijing and Seoul, which see the visits as a lack of remorse about Japanese aggression, as well as her recent xenophobic remarks. </p><p>Takaichi has toned down her hawkish rhetoric. On Friday, she sent a religious ornament instead of going to Yasukuni.</p>

<div class="article-title">Amazon Web Services outage finally resolved</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Amazon says a massive outage of its cloud computing service has been resolved as of Monday evening, after a problem disrupted internet use around the world, taking down a broad range of online services, including social media, gaming, food delivery, streaming and financial platforms. </p><p>The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it suddenly breaks down. </p><p>About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was starting to recover, but it wasn't until 6 p.m. Eastern that "services returned to normal operations," Amazon said on its AWS health website, where it tracks outages.</p><p>Cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple said "a slow and bumpy recovery process" is "entirely normal."</p><p>Amazon pinned the outage on issues related to its domain name system that converts web addresses into IP addresses, which are numeric designations that identify locations on the internet. Those addresses allow websites and apps to load on internet-connected devices.</p>
<p>Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages, said in a Facebook post that it received over 11 million user reports of problems at more than 2,500 companies. </p><p>The Amazon division provides remote computing services to many apps, websites, governments, universities and companies. Early Monday, users reported issues with Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, online broker Robinhood, the McDonald's app and many others, according to Downdetector.</p><p>Even Amazon's own services weren't immune. Users of the company's Ring doorbell cameras and Alexa-powered smart speakers posted on DownDetector that they weren't working, while others said they were unable to access the Amazon website or download books to their Kindle.</p><p>By mid-morning, Amazon said it had started to recover, but around 1 p.m. ET, users were still reporting problems. Thousands of Venmo users reported difficulties at about 1:30 p.m. ET, while people also reported problems with AI chatbot Claude, the Wall Street Journal and Amazon services like Alexa around the same time, according to Downdetector. </p>
<p>Some companies and apps posted on social media to alert their users that the AWS outage was impacting their services. </p><p>"An Amazon Web Services outage is impacting information in Transit app. The length of disruption is currently unknown. We apologize for any inconvenience," said RTC Southern Nevada, the transit authority for the region, on X at 1:54 p.m. ET.</p><p>The outage also had ripple effects in the travel industry, with major airline carriersreporting issues.</p><p>A Southwest spokesperson said the outage affected the airline's ability to efficiently dispatch some early morning flights, while United said it disrupted customers' access to the United app and website overnight. Delta said the issue caused a small numbers of minor delays Monday morning.</p><p>The nation's railroad services were also affected. Amtrak reported at 1:30 p.m. EDT that it was experiencing "intermittent technical difficulties" which hobbled SMS, email and push notifications, and prevented customers from booking reservations through Amtrak.com or the mobile app.</p><p>"If you are traveling today, please arrive at your station at your regularly scheduled time typically 30 minutes prior to your train's departure," Amtrak said in a statement shared with CBS News.</p><h2>How did this start?</h2><p>Amazon first reported the outage issue at 3:11 a.m. ET. Shortly after, it said its services in its eastern U.S. region were disrupted and engineers were working to understand what was causing the problem. At 5:27 a.m. ET, AWS began reporting progress, saying, "We are seeing significant signs of recovery."</p>
<p>A little more than a half-hour later, it said, "We continue to observe recovery across most" of the affected services. </p><p>AWS customers include some of the world's biggest businesses and organizations.</p><p>"So much of the world now relies on these three or four big (cloud) compute companies who provide the underlying infrastructure that when there's an issue like this, it can be really impactful across a broad range, a broad spectrum" of online services, said Patrick Burgess, a cybersecurity expert at U.K.-based BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT.</p><p>"The world now runs on the cloud" and the internet is seen as a utility like water or electricity as we spend so much of our lives on our smartphones, Burgess said.</p><p>And because so much of the online world's plumbing is underpinned by a handful of companies, when something goes wrong "it's very difficult for users to pinpoint what is happening because we don't see Amazon, we just see Snapchat or Roblox," Burgess said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Remains of another hostage returned to Israel, Israeli military says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The remains of another deceased hostage crossed into Israel after being handed over to the Red Cross on Monday evening local time, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement posted on social media. </p><p>An Israeli group that represents the hostages' families confirmed on Tuesday morning that the remains had been identified as those of Tal Haimi, a non-commissioned officer who was killed during the Oct. 7, 2023 attack at the kibbutz where he lived.</p><p>"On the morning of October 7, Tal went out to defend his community, fighting against dozens of terrorists at the gates of Nir Yitzhak," the Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. "He and his team fought with extraordinary courage for several hours. During the battle, Tal was killed and taken to Gaza."</p><p>There were thought to be 16 remains of deceased hostages still in Gaza before his body was handed over on Monday, with 12 confirmed sets of remains already transferred.</p><p>Before announcing the handover of the 13th set of remains on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces said in an earlier statement that Hamas "is required to uphold the [peace] agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the deceased hostages."</p>
<p>The return of all the hostages — of whom there were 20 living and 28 dead — is a cornerstone of the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan. Hamas was supposed to have completed the handover by Monday, Oct. 13, but only returned the 20 living hostages by that deadline.</p><p>The return of the remains on Monday came after U.S. senior envoy <span class="link">Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner</span> met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel to try to keep the peace process on track following a bout of violence over the weekend. </p><p>Netanyahu said Monday that the military had dropped almost 169 tons of bombs in the Gaza Strip over the weekend. The IDF said it launched the strikes after two soldiers were killed when Hamas operatives opened fire with an RPG. Hamas has rejected Israel's claim that it was involved in that attack.</p><p>The skies over Gaza were quiet again on Monday, and both sides recommitted to the peace process.</p>
<p>Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance are following in the footsteps of Mr. Trump's two peace envoys and departed for Israel on Monday afternoon, according to a spokesman for Vance. Shosh Bedrosian, a spokeswoman for Netanyahu's office, said Monday that Vance and his wife were expected to be in Israel "for a few days and will be meeting with the prime minister."</p><p>The IDF said on Monday it was marking a so-called "yellow line" — the line to which Israeli troops withdrew as part of the peace plan.</p>

<div class="article-title">Daniel Naroditsky, American chess grandmaster, dies at 29</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Daniel Naroditsky, a chess grandmaster who started as a <span class="link">child prodigy</span> and quickly became one of the most influential American voices in the sport, died Monday. He was 29. </p><p>The Charlotte Chess Center in North Carolina, where Naroditsky trained and worked as a coach, announced his death on social media, saying it was unexpected and calling him "a talented chess player, educator, and beloved member of the chess community."  </p><p>"Let us remember Daniel for his passion and love for the game of chess, and for the joy and inspiration he brought to us all every day," his family said in a statement shared by the center.  </p><p>The cause of death wasn't provided. </p><p>Naroditsky became a grandmaster, the highest title in chess aside from World Chess Champion, at the age of 18.  </p>
<p>Years earlier, the California-born player won the Under 12 world championship and spent his teenage years writing chess strategy books as he climbed the world rankings.  </p><p>He was consistently ranked in the top 200 worldwide for traditional chess and also excelled at a fast-paced style called blitz chess, maintaining a top 25 ranking throughout his adult career. Most recently Naroditsky, known to many as Danya, won the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August.</p>
<p>Fellow grandmasters credited Naroditsky with introducing the sport to a wider audience by livestreaming many of his matches and sharing live commentary on others. Thousands of people regularly tuned in on YouTube and the interactive streaming platform Twitch to watch Naroditsky play.  </p><p>"He loved streaming, and he loved trying to be educational. The chess world is very grateful," Hikaru Nakamura, an American grandmaster, said on a livestream Monday. </p>
<p>In a final video posted to his YouTube channel on Friday titled "You Thought I Was Gone!?" Naroditsky tells viewers he's "back, better than ever" after taking a creative break from streaming. He talks viewers through his moves as he plays live chess matches on the computer from a cozy home studio.  </p><p>Other elite chess players from around the globe took to social media to express their shock and sadness. </p><p>Dutch chess grandmaster Benjamin Bok reflected on his lifelong friendship with Naroditsky, who he said he's known since the Under 12 world championship that Naroditsky won in 2007. </p><p>"I still can't believe it and don't want to believe it," Bok said on X. "It was always a privilege to play, train, and commentate with Danya, but above all, to call him my friend." </p><p>Naroditsky was the son of Jewish immigrants to the U.S. from Ukraine and Azerbaijan. He was born and raised in San Mateo County, California, and was described by his parents as a very serious kid with an impressive attention span and memory. He went on to study history at Stanford University, earning a bachelor's degree in 2019 after taking a year off to play in chess tournaments.  </p><p>After college, he moved to Charlotte, where he coached the area's top junior chess players.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Toronto Blue Jays beat the Seattle Mariners 4-3 in Game 7 of ALCS to secure their first World Series appearance since 1993. They now face the Los Angeles Dodgers for a shot at the Commissioner's Trophy.</p><p>Seattle was up 3-1 in the 7th inning of the winner-take-all game, but a 3-run home run off the bat of George Springer catapulted the Blue Jays into the lead. The Mariners never even had a baserunner over the final two innings.</p><p>Springer's was the first go-ahead homer in Game 7 history when a team trailed by multiple runs in the seventh inning or later.</p><p>The Blue Jays now look to win their third title in franchise history. The Dodgers, who swept the Milwaukee Brewers to secure the National League pennant, are looking to repeat as World Series champions and take home a ninth title.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays will host Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers in Friday night's opener as Los Angeles tries to become the first repeat winner in a quarter century.</p>
<p>Toronto hosts the opener because it finished the regular season with 94 wins, one more than the Dodgers. </p><p>The Blue Jays were playing in a Game 7 for the first time since losing at home to Kansas City in the 1985 ALCS. </p><p>Toronto slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. arrived at the stadium wearing a Maple Leafs hockey jersey with Auston Matthews' name and number. Fortunately for Guerrero, his team did not follow in Matthews' footsteps, as the star forward is 0-6 in Game 7s with Toronto during his 10 seasons in the NHL. </p><p>Cal Raleigh and Julio Rodríguez each hit a solo home run for the Mariners in the team's first Game 7 but Seattle failed to reach its first World Series, leaving the heartbroken Mariners as the only major league team without a pennant. </p>
<p>Addison Barger walked to begin the seventh and Isiah Kiner-Falefa followed with a single. Seattle right-hander Bryan Woo was removed after Andrés Giménez advanced the runners with a sacrifice bunt, and Springer greeted Eduard Bazardo with his fourth homer of this postseason, a 381-foot drive to left field that got the sellout crowd of 44,770 roaring.</p><p>The Dodgers, meanwhile, have overrun opponents during the postseason. Ohtani is starring at the plate and on the mound, a performance that would be deemed CGI if not witnessed by thousands in person. </p><p>"Sometimes you've got to check yourself and touch him to make sure he's not just made of steel," teammate Freddie Freeman said. </p><p>But before his three-homer at the plate and 10-strikeouts, six-scoreless innings mound show Friday night, Ohtani's bat had been slumping. </p><p>He's hitting .220 with five homers and nine RBIs in the postseason and is 2-0 with a 2.25 ERA in a pair of pitching starts, striking out 19 and walking four in 12 innings. </p><p>Los Angeles is the first defending champion to reach the World Series since the 2009 Philadelphia Phillies, who lost to the New York Yankees in six games. No team has won consecutive titles since the Yankees took three in a row from 1998-2000. The gap is the longest in baseball history, topping the previous high between the 1977-78 Yankees and the 1992-93 Blue Jays.</p>

<div class="article-title">New court filings reveal who the DOJ alleges Comey authorized to leak info</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A new court filing by James Comey's attorneys definitively answers a lingering question about the criminal charges against the former FBI director: Who is "Person 3"?</p><p><span class="link">The Department of Justice last month charged</span> Comey with lying during a 2020 Senate hearing. The two-page indictment accuses the former FBI director of falsely telling lawmakers that he never gave anybody at the FBI permission to serve as an anonymous source in news reports about the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton. But it doesn't name the FBI staffer whom Comey allegedly authorized to leak, referring to them only as "Person 3."</p><p>In a <span class="link">motion filed Monday to dismiss the charges</span>, Comey's lawyers wrote that last week, the government "confirmed to the defense that … Person 3 refers to Daniel Richman."</p><p>Richman, a longtime friend of Comey, is a Columbia University law professor and former federal prosecutor in New York. He <span class="link">served at one point as</span> a "special government employee" at the FBI when Comey led the bureau.</p><p>It's still unclear what information Richman is accused of leaking. The Justice Department has not charged Richman with a crime or accused him of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Monday's filing — which argues Comey is the victim of a vindictive prosecution driven by President Trump's "personal animus" toward him — marks the first time that court papers have named the person the Justice Department believes Comey authorized to leak. Several media outlets had previously reported that Richman was "Person 3."</p><p>Richman's name did not come up in the Senate testimony that led to Comey's charges.</p><p>Instead, the indictment focuses on a testy back-and-forth in 2020, when Republican Sen. Ted Cruz grilled Comey about whether he let a different person — former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe — leak information about the Clinton probe to the Wall Street Journal. McCabe says he told Comey after the article came out that he authorized the leak, and Comey approved of it, but Comey has long insisted that no such conversation took place.</p><p>Comey had previously told Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley <span class="link">at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in 2017</span> that he never authorized anyone to serve as an anonymous source in media coverage on the FBI's investigations into Clinton or Mr. Trump. Three years later, Cruz argued McCabe's statements about the Wall Street Journal leak contradicted that.</p>
<p>"Now, what Mr. McCabe is saying and what you testified to this committee cannot both be true. One or the other is false," Cruz said to Comey in 2020. "Who's telling the truth?"</p><p>"I can only speak to my testimony. I stand by the testimony," replied Comey.</p><p>In Monday's filing, Comey's attorneys cast the fact that Cruz didn't ask about Richman as a fatal flaw in the government's case against the ex-FBI chief, who was charged with one count of making false statements to Congress and one count of obstructing a congressional investigation.</p><p>The lawyers wrote: "the indictment omits Senator Cruz's words that explicitly narrow the focus of his questions to Mr. McCabe and misleadingly implies that the questioning related to Mr. Richman."</p><p>"In other words, the indictment presents an inaccurate description of the testimony at the heart of this case," the court filing continued.</p><p>His attorneys also argue the Justice Department's charges misquote Comey. The indictment says Comey falsely stated to the Senate that he hadn't "authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports" — but that exact phrase was actually used by Cruz and Grassley, not Comey. And the filing notes that Cruz used the phrase "Clinton administration," not "Clinton investigation."</p><p>The filing says Comey is planning on asking for his false statement count to be dismissed "based on a defense of literal truth." It referenced the Supreme Court case Bronston v. United States, which said people who make literally true statements under oath aren't guilty of perjury.</p>
<p>CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department, Comey's attorneys and Richman for comment.</p><h2>What is Daniel Richman accused of doing?</h2><p>The indictment doesn't say what information the Justice Department believes Richman leaked to the media. It states only that Comey "authorized PERSON 3 to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding an FBI investigation concerning PERSON 1." </p><p>Comey's lawyers confirmed in Monday's filing that "Person 1" referred to Clinton.</p><p>The filing points to one FBI leak investigation involving Comey and Richman called "Arctic Haze," which was detailed in a memo declassified by the bureau earlier this year. Arctic Haze sought to figure out how classified details on the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server made their way into a 2017 New York Times article, which looked at Comey's decision-making while leading the politically fraught probe.</p><p>Richman was interviewed as part of Arctic Haze, according to the heavily redacted memo, which was published by the conservative-leaning site Just The News. The memo says Richman told FBI agents he had spoken with one of the authors of the Times article, but he didn't know how the reporter got a hold of the classified information, and Richman said he was "sure 'with a discount'" that he didn't tell the reporter himself.</p><p>The memo describes Richman as Comey's "liaison to the media," but also notes at one point: "Richman later told the interviewing agents Comey never asked him to talk to the media."</p><p>The Arctic Haze investigation closed without any charges. The memo said the probe "has not yielded sufficient evidence to criminally charge any person, including Comey or Richman, with making false statements or with the substantive offenses under investigation."</p>
<p>Separately, during the first Trump term, Comey was <span class="link">investigated by the Justice Department's inspector general</span> for giving memos about his conversations with Mr. Trump to Richman, who then provided their contents to a Times reporter. The internal watchdog found that Comey "violated applicable policies" but did not release any classified information.</p><p>Mr. Trump has <span class="link">accused Comey</span> of leaks and other nefarious conduct for almost a decade, stretching back to when he fired Comey as FBI director in 2017. The president has long criticized how Comey handled the FBI's probes into Clinton and the Trump campaign. Comey, for his part, has <span class="link">called</span> Mr. Trump "morally unfit to be president."</p><p>In Monday's court papers, Comey's lawyers asserted that Mr. Trump's longstanding "personal spite" led to the charges against him, which were filed shortly before the statute of limitations expired. </p><p>"No reasonable prosecutor would have brought such a deficient case; the only explanation is that the President's handpicked interim U.S. Attorney did so to carry out the President's wishes," they wrote in a 51-page filing, which also included a 60-page attachment listing all of the verbal barbs flung between Comey and Mr. Trump over the years.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>For someone with zero interest in golf, Cathy Kochensparger sure loves her golf cart. She bought it as a family cruiser and drives it around town almost daily, but says that safety is paramount. </p><p>"You've got to be aware of your surroundings, people and other vehicles," Kochensparger said.</p><p>St. Johns, Michigan, is aware its surroundings are changing. In the city of roughly 8,000 people, golf carts motor side-by-side with everyday traffic. St. Johns started regulating them last month — one of hundreds of communities across the country — putting restrictions on which roads the carts can be driven on.</p><p>St. Johns Mayor Scott Dzurka said the city has roughly 2,000 golf carts used primarily for transportation.</p><p>"Heaven forbid something happens on one of them. If that golf cart gets in a wreck, it's pretty disastrous," Dzurka said.</p>
<p>Safety is the primary reason why more than two dozen communities in Michigan alone have passed ordinances regulating golf carts on public roads.</p><p>Michael Fagan owns a booming golf cart business, but says golfers represent only 5% of his customer base. The big seller is lifestyle.</p><p>"And even year-round, 'cause we put snow plows on 'em, salt spreaders. You know, people are looking at me goofy when I say that, but we probably sell 15 to 20 snow plows a year," Fagan said.</p><p>St. Johns resident Ed Thelen opposes golf carts mixing with cars because of the safety issues they pose.</p>
<p>"If a cart hits a car, the golf cart is just going to lose. There's nothing there to protect the people in the golf cart," Thelen said.</p><p>St. Johns just started inspecting golf carts, similar to cars, for working turn signals and horns. Drivers also have to be at least 18 years old and hold a valid drivers license.</p><p>By law now, Kochensparger can drive her cart only on streets where the speed limit is 25 miles an hour or lower. Her golf cart's speed limit is 15 miles per hour.</p><p>When asked if she feels safe in one, Kochensparger said, "Oh definitely, definitely I do. I wouldn't take my grandkids on it if I didn't."</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A decade after a landmark study proved that feeding peanut products to young babies could prevent development of life-threatening allergies, new research finds the change has made a big difference in the real world. </p><p>About 60,000 children have avoided developing peanut allergies after guidance first issued in 2015 upended medical practice by recommending introducing the allergen to infants starting as early as 4 months. </p><p>"That's a remarkable thing, right?" said Dr. David Hill, an allergist and researcher at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and author of a study published Monday in the medical journal Pediatrics. Hill and colleagues analyzed electronic health records from dozens of pediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in young children before, during and after the guidelines were issued. </p><p>"I can actually come to you today and say there are less kids with food allergy today than there would have been if we hadn't implemented this public health effort," he added.</p><p>"Our findings have relevance from those of us who treat patients to those caring for infants, and more awareness, education and advocacy could further increase the positive results we observed in this study," he continued. "Future studies could potentially explore specific feeding practices that help us better understand the timing, frequency and dose of foods that optimize protection against food allergies."</p>
<p>The researchers found that peanut allergies in children ages 0 to 3 declined by more than 27% after guidance for high-risk kids was first issued in 2015 and by more than 40% after the recommendations were expanded in 2017. </p><p>The effort hasn't yet reduced an overall increase in food allergies in the U.S. in recent years. About 8% of children are affected, including more than 2% with a peanut allergy. </p><p>Peanut allergy is caused when the body's immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in peanuts as harmful and releases chemicals that trigger allergic symptoms, including hives, respiratory symptoms and, sometimes, life-threatening anaphylaxis. </p><p>For decades, doctors had recommended delaying feeding children peanuts and other foods likely to trigger allergies until age 3. But in 2015, Gideon Lack at King's College London published the groundbreaking Learning Early About Peanut Allergy, or LEAP, trial.  </p>
<p>Lack and colleagues showed that introducing peanut products in infancy reduced the future risk of developing food allergies by more than 80%. Later analysis showed that the protection persisted in about 70% of kids into adolescence.  </p><p>The study immediately sparked new guidelines urging early introduction of peanuts — but putting them into practice has been slow. </p><p>Only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found. </p><p>Confusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study. Early on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings.  </p><p>The data for the analysis came from a subset of participating practice sites and may not represent the entire U.S. pediatric population, noted the commentary, led by Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a child allergy expert at Northwestern University.  </p><p>However, the new research offers "promising evidence that early allergen introduction is not only being adopted but may be making a measurable impact," the authors concluded.  </p><p>Advocates for the 33 million people in the U.S. with food allergies welcomed signs that early introduction of peanut products is catching on. </p>
<p>"This research reinforces what we already know and underscores a meaningful opportunity to reduce the incidence and prevalence of peanut allergy nationwide," said Sung Poblete, chief executive of the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research &amp; Education, or FARE.  </p><p>The new study emphasizes the current guidance, updated in 2021, which calls for introducing peanuts and other major food allergens between four and six months, without prior screening or testing, Hill said. Parents should consult their pediatricians about any questions.  </p><p>"It doesn't have to be a lot of the food, but little tastes of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurts and tree butters," he said. "These are really good ways to allow the immune system exposure to these allergenic foods in a safe way." </p><p>Tiffany Leon, 36, a Maryland registered dietician and director at FARE, introduced peanuts and other allergens early to her own sons, James, 4, and Cameron, 2. </p><p>At first, Leon's own mother was shocked at the advice to feed babies such foods before the age of 3, she said. But Leon explained how the science had changed. </p><p>"As a dietician, I practice evidence-based recommendations," she said. "So when someone told me, 'This is how it's done now, these are the new guidelines,' I just thought, 'OK, well, this is what we're going to do.'"</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Louvre, the world's most iconic museum, remained closed Monday after <span class="link">thieves stole priceless treasures</span> from the Apollon Gallery, the home of the French crown jewels. In a daring <span class="link">daytime heist</span> Sunday, the thieves made off with eight pieces, but dropped one as they made their escape.</p><p>Here's what the robbers got away with:</p><h2>Empress Eugénie's tiara  </h2>
<p>The Pearl and Diamond Tiara was commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III to celebrate his marriage to Eugénie de Montijo in 1853, according to Tatler. The piece features 212 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds.</p><h2>Grand Corsage Bow brooch from Empress Eugénie</h2>
<p>The brooch seen above was originally the center of a belt made up of more than 4,000 stones belonging to the Crown Diamonds that was placed on display at the Universal Exhibition of 1855. It was later worn at least twice by Empress Eugénie, according to the Louvre's website.</p><h2>Tiara, necklace and earrings from Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense</h2>
<p>A sapphire tiara, necklace and single earring worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense were stolen from the Louvre on Sunday. Some have speculated that the set may have once belonged to Marie Antoinette.</p>
<h2>Emerald necklace and earrings from Empress Marie-Louise</h2>
<p>An emerald necklace and earrings stolen Sunday were originally a wedding gift from Napoleon to his second wife, Empress Marie-Louise of Austria, in 1810.</p><h2>Diamond-encrusted brooch  </h2>
<p>This diamond-encrusted brooch was originally made for the Empress Eugénie, according to the Louvre's website. The brooch is made from both diamond and gold. </p><h2>The crown of Empress Eugenie was discovered outside the museum </h2>
<p>The crown of Empress Eugenie was found outside the museum. The thieves apparently dropped the piece, made of gold, emerald and diamonds, as they made their getaway.</p><p>Officials say the robbers broke in using a crane-type lift to reach an upper window, smashed the glass of the display cases to grab the jewels, and then escaped on motorcycles or scooters. Tourists were inside at the time, but no one was injured.</p>
<p>French Culture Minister Rachida Dati called the robbery the work of "professionals" who got in and out in just minutes.</p>

<div class="article-title">States warn SNAP benefits may stop in November if shutdown continues</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.</p><p>"Starting October 16, SNAP  [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal <span class="link">government shutdown</span> ends and funds are released to PA," reads a notice from the Pennsylvania state website.</p><p>New Jersey, <span class="link">Maryland</span>, New York and Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.</p><p>The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be "insufficient funds" to pay full November SNAP benefits.</p><p>Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program. Advocates, meanwhile, have warned the effects could be devastating.</p>
<p>"These are, for the most part, working individuals who still are living paycheck to paycheck," said Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research &amp; Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger. </p><h2>How SNAP benefits are normally administered</h2><p>Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.</p><p>While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a "delicate partnership of public and private entities."</p><p>To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards. </p>
<p>"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time," Plata-Nino explained. "They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe."</p><p>The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors "until further notice." The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.</p><p>"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one," Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident and SNAP recipient, told CBS News.</p><h2>Contingency funding</h2><p>One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.</p><p>After Democrats and Republicans <span class="link">failed to come to an agreement</span> to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown. </p><p>"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year," the plan states. </p><p>However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on whether that option is under consideration. </p>
<p>During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, Plata-Nino said.</p><p>"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ..." Plata-Nino said. "They have the money, so it really is a policy choice."</p><p>It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.</p><p>Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states.</p>

<div class="article-title">Biden completes round of radiation therapy to treat aggressive prostate cancer</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Former President Joe Biden has completed a round of radiation therapy to treat an aggressive form of <span class="link">prostate cancer</span> — an encouraging sign of progress — but one that does not signal the end of his treatment.</p><p>A Biden spokeswoman confirmed to CBS News Monday that the former president, who turns 83 next month, finished several weeks of radiation therapy treatment Monday at Penn Medicine Radiation Oncology in Philadelphia. His office first announced Oct. 11 that the former president had been undergoing radiation treatment for prostate cancer for several weeks. </p><p>"He rang the bell today," Biden spokeswoman Kelly Scully said.</p><p>Ashley Biden, the daughter of the former president, posted on Instagram a quick video clip of her father ringing the bell, with the caption, "Rung the bell! Thank you to the incredible doctors, nurses, and staff at Penn Medicine. We are so grateful!"</p><p>Subsequent photos posted by the one-time first daughter show the former president posing with a medical professional, and another with former first lady Jill Biden and two of their grandchildren with the caption, "Dad has been so damn brave throughout his treatment. Grateful."</p>
<p>Most cancer treatment centers encourage patients to ring a wall-mounted bell when they complete cancer treatment to signal their progress and encouragement to other patients. But it is unclear at this time whether Biden will need to undergo any other treatment, since doctors always need to assess a patient's progress in the weeks after they complete cancer treatment.</p><p>Biden announced in May that he had an advanced stage of <span class="link">prostate cancer</span> that has metastasized, or spread, to his bones, prompting an <span class="link">outpouring of concern</span> and a new round of questions about his health and whether he faced undisclosed or unknown medical challenges during his presidency.</p><p>According to a statement from his office in May, the former president was diagnosed with "prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone" after a small nodule was found in the prostate.</p><p>Gleason scores are a grading system, and the lower the grade, the more cancer cells look like normal cells. A score of 9 is the second-highest, <span class="link">CBS News previously reported</span>, and places Biden in the most aggressive risk category. </p>
<p>Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer that affects men, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Age is the most common risk factor. The condition has many forms of treatment, including radiation, chemotherapy, surgery and hormone treatment. </p><p>Biden also <span class="link">underwent a skin cancer surgery</span> in September 2025. That procedure was a Mohs surgery, which involves cutting away thin layers of skin until only cancer-free tissue remains in the affected area. </p><p>The former president is occasionally spotted in Washington, where he still keeps an office, and aboard Amtrak trains to and from his home in Delaware. He has begun fundraising and planning for an eventual library and museum documenting his time in the White House. </p>

<div class="article-title">White House begins demolition of part of East Wing for Trump's ballroom</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington </em>— Demolition on the White House's East Wing has begun, although President Trump previously said his ballroom addition to the White House wouldn't "interfere" with the building's existing structure.  </p><p>The Washington Post first reported on the demolition and published an image of the work. And on Monday, a pool reporter captured video of part of the East Wing being torn down. </p><p>During an event Monday with the Louisiana State University baseball team at the White House, the president remarked on the construction, which he said "just started today." </p><p>"You know we're building — right behind us — we're building a ballroom," Mr. Trump said during the celebration of the 2024 NCAA champions in the White House East Room. He pointed out, "Right on the other side, you have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically."</p>
<p>The president told reporters in September that construction had begun, though at the time, no part of the White House building had been demolished.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shared a social media post by Mr. Trump Monday announcing that "ground has been broken" for the "new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom."</p><p>"For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State visits, etc.," Mr. Trump said in the post. "I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway — with zero cost to the American Taxpayer!"</p><p>The East Wing of the White House is fairly small and is where the first lady's office and staff are located.</p><p>"It won't interfere with the current building," the president said in July. "It won't be. It'll be near it but not touching it — and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of."</p>
<p>The White House says the project, which will cost $250 million, has been fully funded by private contributions from business and big tech, including Apple, Microsoft and Coinbase. Earlier this month, ballroom donors dined at the White House with Mr. Trump. </p><p>By September, a number of companies had pledged to donate $5 million or more for the addition, multiple sources familiar with the matter said. </p><p>The addition was originally planned to be 90,000 square feet, but that figure is likely to increase. The ballroom, which will be used for events that on occasion will include heads of state, is intended to hold 999 people, up from an initial estimate of 650. Mr. Trump said it will have bulletproof glass windows on all sides. </p><p>CBS News previously obtained <span class="link">renderings</span> of the ballroom. </p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Microchips implanted into the back of the eyes of legally blind patients have helped some of them read again, according to a new study published Monday.</p><p>Out of the 32 patients with geographic atrophy — an advanced form of dry <span class="link">age-related macular degeneration</span> — who completed the clinical study, 26 of them showed "meaningful improvement in visual acuity from baseline" 12 months after receiving the implant, the research published in the New England Journal of Medicine said.</p><p>The treatment involves inserting a tiny implant thinner than human hair under the retina. Patients then have to wear specia glasses, which have a video camera and project what it sees via near-infrared light to the implant. The implant-glasses combination is called the photovoltaic retina implant microarray, or PRIMA.</p>
<p>One of the people who received the treatment, 70-year-old Sheila Irvine, told CBS News partner the BBC it was "out of this world" to be able to read and do crosswords again. </p><p>"It's beautiful, wonderful. It gives me such pleasure," Irvine said. "Technology is moving so fast, it's amazing that I am part of it."</p><p>While Irvine's improvement is dramatic, it still requires a lot of concentration for her to use the PRIMA glasses, the BBC reported. She needs to put a pillow under her chin to steady the camera and it can focus on just a few letters at a time. Letters like C and O are also hard for her to distinguished without switching to magnification mode, according to the BBC.</p>
<p>Geographic atrophy, which affects some 5 million people wordwide, is the leading cause of blindness in older people. Until recently, there had been no treatment to improve patient's abilities to read or recognize faces, the study's lead author Frank Holz said.</p><p>"The achievement previously was pharmacological treatment, which slows down the progression, the expansion of the atrophic areas in the retina," Holz, a retina specialist based in Germany, told Modern Retina at a conferences of retina experts last week. </p><p>In 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved <span class="link">Syfovre</span>, the first drug aproved to treat geographic atrophy. It's administered with an injection and can slow the progression of the disease, although it does not reverse it.</p><p>There are two forms of macular degeneration: wet and dry. The wet form causes abnormal blood vessels to grow under the retina, causing scarring on the macula — which is located in the center of the retina. It impacts 15% of people and a treatment option has been on the market for many years. </p>
<p>The dry form is more common and causes the macula to get thinner and tiny protein clumps called drusen to grow. Until the FDA approved Syfovre, no treatment existed.</p><p>"But now with this device, a 2-by-2-millimeter implant, which for the first time restores visual acuity in those patients who are so advanced that they have lost completely their central portion, their central vision, in their retina," Holz said.</p><p>CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook noted that while the device can help some people with geography atrophy, the clinical study is small. </p><p>The PRIMA implant, made by California-based biotech Science Corporation, is also not yet licensed and isn't available as a treatment outside the trials, the BBC reported.</p><p>"This breakthrough underscores our commitment to pioneering technologies that provide hope to patients in need, and which have the ability to transform lives," Max Hodak, founder and CEO of Science, said in a news release Monday. "We are excited about the potential of PRIMA to redefine vision restoration for these patients."</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Halloween is creeping up on Americans' calendars and their wallets. </p><p>With Halloween falling on a Friday this year, celebrations are expected to be bigger. Consumers are opening their wallets for everything spooky, from candy to costumes, despite paying higher prices for many items.</p><p>U.S. consumers are expected to spend a record $13.1 billion this Halloween, up from $11.6 billion last year, according to the National Retail Federation. That breaks the previous record of $12.2 billion set in 2023. On average, Americans will shell out $114.45 per person, nearly $11 more than last year.</p><p>The Hershey Co., which makes Halloween favorites including Hershey bars, Kit Kat bars and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, told CBS News there was "no impact on Halloween candy prices this season." But prices at the register are telling a different story. According to CBS, a box of 48 full-size chocolate bars has <span class="link">jumped</span> from $40 to more than $50.</p><p>Cocoa prices have more than doubled since early 2024, according to the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute's latest analysis. Extreme weather in West Africa, which supplies 70% of the world's cocoa, has slashed yields, with heavy rains, crop disease and droughts causing the biggest supply deficit in more than 60 years. </p>
<p>The world's top producers, Ivory Coast and Ghana, saw cocoa output drop by more than 25% and 31%, respectively, in the last year.</p><p>Price-conscious shoppers have some options other than chocolate treats this year, Stew Leonard Jr., the president and CEO of Stew Leonard's, a family-owned grocery chain in the Northeast, told CBS News. He recommended gummy bears and Starbursts instead.</p><p>"They are about 18 cents. So almost half the price [of a mini chocolate bar]," he said. </p><p>Alcohol prices may also hit consumers' wallets, given a 15% tariff on imported spirits. That could encourage shoppers to turn to domestically produced wines, beers and spirits. </p>
<p>Nearly 90% of Halloween products, such as costumes and decorations, contain at least one component made overseas — most often in China — according to the Halloween and Costume Association. These products are vulnerable to supply chain issues and a 30% tariff rate on Chinese imports. </p><p>Consumers are expected to spend an average of $37.62 on a single Halloween costume this year, an 11% increase from 2024, according to the National Retail Federation.</p><h2>DIY Halloween</h2><p>Despite the higher costs, most U.S. adults still plan to celebrate Halloween, but some consumers are turning to <span class="link">budget-friendly techniques</span> to rein in spending.</p><p>A report from Nielsen IQ shows that Gen Z consumers are embracing budget-friendly, reusable and DIY décor, often inspired by social media and driven by a focus on sustainability.</p><p>Millennials are combining new purchases with reused items, while baby boomers and Gen Xers are more likely to scale back spending but still participate in Halloween traditions, Nielsen found. In fact, 55% of Millennials and 42% of Gen Z say they'll prioritize DIY or reused décor this year.</p><p>Shopping early to avoid last-minute price hikes, choosing generic candy instead of big name brands and buying in bulk can also help save money, experts say.</p>

<div class="article-title">Open enrollment may bring sticker shock as health insurance set to surge</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Open enrollment — the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits — may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new analysis from consultant Mercer. </p><p>That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers. </p><p>More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% — or 164.7 million people — covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.</p><p>Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's 2024 employer health benefits survey.</p><p>The findings come as American households continue to feel <span class="link">squeezed by rising prices</span>, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the <span class="link">GLP-1 drugs</span> used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said. </p>
<p>Employees "might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well — higher co-pays, higher deductibles — so it's getting hit on both ends," Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.</p><p>Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.</p><p>Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. "We think costs are pretty sticky right now," he said.</p><h2>Financial squeeze </h2><p>Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August analysis.</p>
<p>In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a December report. </p><p>Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank. </p><p>A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance. </p><p>"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give," Owens said. That could mean cutting "a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting <span class="link">groceries on the credit card</span> so you can clear the health care premiums."</p><p>The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24. </p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump reiterated his call on Sunday for an immediate halt to the three-and-a-half-year full-scale war in Ukraine, saying the battle lines should be frozen where they currently stand, with Russia's invading forces occupying most of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. </p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly rejected the idea of forfeiting the Donbas, or any other occupied ground, to Moscow in the years since Vladimir Putin ordered Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. </p><p>"Let it be cut the way it is. It's cut up right now. I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia. You leave it the way it is right now," Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday on Air Force One, apparently referring specifically to the Donbas region. "They can negotiate something later on down the line. But I said cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people."</p><p>The <span class="link">Donbas is a culturally and economically significant region</span>, where many people speak Russian and have sympathies with Moscow. It is home to much of Ukraine's heavy industry and mining, accounting for about 16% of the country's GDP before the war started, according to The Associated Press.  </p><p>His remarks came two days after Mr. <span class="link">Trump met in person with Zelenskyy</span> at the White House, which was a day after he spoke on the phone for two hours with Putin.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy appeared to reiterate Kyiv's unwillingness to cede any territory for a ceasefire on Sunday, meanwhile, saying he had urged European leaders to apply "the right kind of pressure" on Russia. </p>
<p>"Almost every day now, we are communicating with leaders to ensure that we have a common position, all of us in Europe, on putting pressure on Russia — the right kind of pressure. We will grant the aggressor no gifts and forget nothing," Zelenskyy said in a social media post. </p><p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Sunday that Ukraine should not be put under pressure to make concessions on its territory.</p><p>"None of us should put pressure on Zelenskyy when it comes to territorial concessions," he said in a social media post. "We should all put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression. Appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace."</p><p>In another social media post, Zelenskyy called his Friday Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump a "pointed conversation." </p>
<p>The Financial Times newspaper reported Sunday that the meeting had descended into a shouting match on occasion, with Mr. Trump "cursing all the time." Zelenskyy's delegation had brought in maps of the battlefield and Mr. Trump threw them to one side saying he was "sick" of seeing them, according to the FT report, which cited an official familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>In response to a request for comment on the report of a second heated exchange between the leaders, the White House referred CBS News on Monday to Mr. Trump's remarks to reporters on Air Force One, without providing any additional description of the meeting. The Ukrainian president's office did not immediately reply to CBS News' request for comment for this story.  </p><p>Mr. Trump said in a post on his own Truth Social media platform that his meeting with the Ukrainian leader was "very interesting, and cordial."</p><p>Speaking with reporters on Sunday, in remarks that were embargoed until Monday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine shared "President Trump's positive outlook if it leads to the end  of the war. After many rounds of discussion over more than two hours  with him and his team, his message, in my view, is positive — that we  stand where we stand on the line of contact, provided all sides  understand what is meant."</p><p>"I told him, as I likewise strongly suggested to President Putin, that it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL! Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts. They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide," Mr. Trump said Sunday. </p><p>The White House meeting followed Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy's <span class="link">incredibly tense encounter</span> in front of television cameras in February.    </p><p>The president had spoken on Thursday with Putin by phone. Following that lengthy discussion, the White House said Mr. Trump would hold a second bilateral summit with Putin in Hungary's capital, Budapest, at a still-to-be-confirmed date to discuss a possible ceasefire deal. Mr. Trump said it would likely happen within a couple weeks.</p>
<p>It will be their second bilateral meeting this year, following in-person talks in Alaska in August. That diplomatic effort by Mr. Trump yielded no tangible results, as Moscow has continued to press its military campaign, taking more territory on the ground and bombarding Ukrainian cities from the air. Putin has also so far declined Mr. Trump's urging to hold a three-way meeting with Zelenskyy.</p><p>U.S. and Ukrainian officials told CBS News that <span class="link">Zelenskyy had hoped</span> Mr. Trump would agree to a deal at Friday's meeting to supply Tomahawk missiles, but that has not yet materialized. Kyiv sees the long-range, guided cruise missiles as vital to give Ukraine's armed forces the ability to hit critical military, logistical and energy targets deep inside Russia. </p><p>Ukraine has ramped up its attacks on key Russian energy infrastructure in recent months. The General Staff of the Armed Services, Ukraine's military headquarters, said Sunday in a social media post that it had struck the Orenburg Gas plant in southern Russia, one of the country's largest natural gas processing plants. </p><p>"The Defense Forces of Ukraine are consistently implementing a set of measures to damage critical enterprises involved in ensuring the needs of the Russian Armed Forces," the general staff staff.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has implemented a policy of selling weapons to Ukraine via America's European NATO allies, who foot the bill for the hardware, since August. That arrangement was worked out between Mr. Trump and other NATO leaders earlier in the summer.  </p><p>Despite positive signals from the White House in recent months regarding a potential deal to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles, Mr. Trump demurred on the subject when asked about it by reporters Friday during his meeting with Zelenskyy. </p><p>"One thing I have to say, we want Tomahawks, also. We don't want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country," Mr. Trump said. </p>
<p>Vice President JD Vance told reporters on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews on Sunday that Mr. Trump had not yet made a final decision on whether to grant Ukraine access to the missiles. </p><p>"If he thinks it is in America's best interest to sell additional weapons to Europe, he will do that, but right now he has not made that decision with regards to Tomahawks," Vance said.</p>

<div class="article-title">'Cancer doesn't care': Patients pushed past divisive politics to lobby Congress</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Mary Catherine Johnson is a retired small-business owner from outside Rochester, New York. She voted for Donald Trump three times.</p> <p>Lexy Mealing, who used to work in a physician's office, is from Long Island, New York. She's a Democrat.</p> <p>But the two women share a common bond. They both survived breast cancer.</p> <p>And when the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network organized its annual citizen lobby day in Washington, D.C., last month, Johnson and Mealing were among the more than 500 volunteers pushing Congress to keep cancer research and support for cancer patients at the top of the U.S. health care agenda.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">An annual plea</h3> <p>The day in Washington is something of a ritual for groups like the cancer organization.</p> <p>This year it came as Democrats and Republicans in Washington slid toward a budget impasse that has shut down the federal government indefinitely. But these volunteers transcended their own political differences and found common ground.</p> <p>"Not one person here discussed if you're a Democrat, if you're a Republican," says Mealing, one of 27 volunteers in the New York delegation. "Cancer doesn't care."</p>
<p>Every one of the volunteer lobbyists had been touched in some way by the deadly disease, which is expected to kill more than 600,000 people in the U.S. this year.</p>
<p>Johnson said each of her mother's 10 siblings died from cancer, as did a lifelong friend who died at age 57, leaving behind his wife and two young daughters.</p> <p>Like many of the New York volunteers, Johnson also says she's worried about the state of politics today.</p> <p>"I think we're probably the most divided that we've ever been," she says. "That scares me. Scares me for my grandchildren."</p> <p>Katie Martin, a volunteer from outside Buffalo, N.Y., also worries. She and her daughter recently drove past political protesters screaming at one another on the street.</p>
<p> "My daughter is silent and then starts asking, 'What is this?' And I don't know how to explain it, because it doesn't even make sense to me," she says. "It's very heartbreaking."</p> <p>Mealing says she can barely watch the news these days. "A lot of Americans are very stressed out. There's a lot of things going on."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Bipartisan support</h3> <p>Americans are indeed split over many issues: immigration, guns, President Trump. But helping people with cancer and other serious illnesses retains broad bipartisan support, polls show.</p> <p>In one recent survey, 7 in 10 voters said it's very important for the federal government to fund medical research. That included majorities of Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>"It's rare in today's environment to see numbers like that," says Jarrett Lewis, a Republican pollster who conducted the survey for patient groups. "But almost everybody in this country knows somebody who's had cancer."</p> <p>Similarly, a recent KFF poll found that three-quarters of U.S. adults, including most Republicans who align with the MAGA movement, want Congress to extend subsidies that help Americans buy health insurance through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. (KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.)</p> <p>These subsidies, which are critical to people with chronic illnesses such as cancer, are one of the main sticking points in the current budget impasse in Congress.</p> <p>As the volunteers gathered in a conference hotel in Washington, they focused on their shared agenda: increasing funding for cancer research, retaining insurance subsidies and expanding access to cancer screening.</p>
<p>"We may not see eye to eye politically. We might not even see eye to eye in social circumstances," said Martin, the Buffalo-area volunteer. "But we can see beyond those differences because we're here for one cause."</p> <p>The state delegations practiced the pitches they would make to their members of Congress. They ran through the personal stories they would share. And they swapped tips for how to deal with resistant staff and how to ask for a photo with a lawmaker.</p>
<p>On the morning of their lobby day, Sept. 16, they reconvened in a cavernous ballroom, all decked out in matching blue polo shirts and armed with red information folders to leave at each office they would visit.</p> <p>They got a pep talk from a pair of college basketball coaches. Then they headed across town to Capitol Hill.</p> <p>The army of volunteers — from every state in the country — hit 484 of the 535 Senate and House offices.</p> <p>Not every visit was an unqualified victory. Many Republican lawmakers object to extending the insurance subsidies, arguing they're too costly.</p> <p>But lawmakers from both parties have backed increased research funding and support for more cancer screening.</p> <p>And the New Yorkers felt good about the day. "It was amazing," Mealing said as the day wrapped up. "You could just feel the sense of, 'Everybody stronger together.'"</p> <h3 class="edTag">Memorials and lessons</h3> <p>When evening came, the volunteers met on the National Mall for a candlelight vigil. It was raining. Bagpipes played.</p> <p>Around a pond near the Lincoln Memorial, some 10,000 tea lights glimmered in little paper bags. Each luminary had a name on it — a life touched by cancer.</p> <p>John Manna, another New Yorker, is a self-described Reagan Republican whose father died from lung cancer. He reflected on lessons that this day could offer a divided nation.</p>
<p>"Talk to people," he said. "Get to know each other as people, and then you can understand somebody's positions.  We have little disagreements, but, you know, we don't attack each other. We talk and discuss it."</p> <p>Manna said he would be back next year.</p> <p><em>KFF Health News</em><em> is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Blue New Jersey is expecting a very close race for governor this November</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>One of the country's few odd-year gubernatorial elections is capturing national attention, as the polls show an increasingly close race between the top two contenders to be New Jersey's next governor.</p> <p>Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy pilot first elected to Congress in 2018, is facing off against pro-Trump Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a longtime New Jersey politician and small business owner. In the closing weeks, both candidates have hurled increasingly personal attacks against one another and received endorsements from some of the biggest names in their parties.</p> <p>President Trump, who endorsed Ciattarelli earlier this year, is planning to host tele-rallies for the Republican contender, Axios reported. Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama released an endorsement video for Sherrill last week, calling the Democratic Congresswoman the "right choice" to be New Jersey's next governor.</p>
<p>Most mainstream polls show Sherrill leading Ciattarelli, but in some cases the margin is smaller than might be expected in the historically blue state. One poll from September showed the candidates tied.</p> <p>Political experts say although Democrats have a three-to-two voter registration advantage over Republicans in New Jersey, the Garden State has a history of electing governors from both major political parties.</p>
<p>"As blue as New Jersey might be in presidential races and U.S. Senate races too, the state is decidedly purple when it comes to gubernatorial elections," says Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy &amp; Citizenship at Rowan University.</p> <p>Phil Murphy, the state's current Democratic governor is leaving office after serving a limit of two terms. If Sherrill wins, it would be the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters elected a governor from the same party three terms in a row.</p> <h2 class="edTag">The campaign has gotten increasingly personal</h2> <p>Tensions have grown in the race to be Murphy's successor, with the two candidates and their campaigns trading personal attacks in recent weeks.</p> <p>Ciattarelli, who served in the state Assembly from 2011-2018 and is running for New Jersey governor for the third time, has repeatedly slammed Sherrill for being prohibited from walking at her Naval Academy graduation in 1994 in the midst of a cheating scandal at the school.</p>
<p>Sherrill has said she was punished by the academy for refusing to turn in her classmates, and she's criticized the Trump administration for improperly releasing her largely unredacted military records to an ally of Ciattarelli's campaign.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Sherrill, who is also a former federal prosecutor, has blasted Ciattarelli's former medical publishing company for producing materials downplaying the dangers of opioids. In a televised debate earlier this month, Sherrill said Ciattarelli was responsible for killing tens of thousands of people in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Ciattarelli's campaign has threatened to sue Sherrill for defamation over those comments, with campaign strategist Chris Russell accusing Sherrill of "baselessly and recklessly accusing a political opponent of mass murder."</p> <p>Also looming large over the campaign is Trump, who frequents his golf course in Bedminster, in Central New Jersey. Ciattarelli's embrace of Trump earned him the president's endorsement, despite the fact that in 2016 he called Trump "a charlatan and an embarrassment." Sherrill has continued to tie Ciattarelli to the president and is urging New Jersey voters to reject Trump's MAGA movement at the polls.</p> <h2 class="edTag">Affordability is top of mind for voters</h2> <p>Though the personal attacks have stepped up, Dworkin doubts they will overpower voters' concerns about skyrocketing prices.</p> <p>"The people who are going to make a difference, who are truly trying to decide where they will vote, want to talk about the cost of living and affordability," he says.</p> <p>Because both Sherrill and Ciattarelli have talked about New Jersey's high cost of living, it may come down to who has the more convincing message.</p> <p>Nicole Nance, a Republican from Cherry Hill, said at a recent campaign event for Ciattarelli that she thinks his background as an accountant will be useful as he tries to lower the state's notoriously high property taxes.</p> <p>"I think I'd rather have a [certified public accountant] with some type of experience help with the budget, you know, help run the state, than a pilot," she said, referring to Sherrill's military background.</p>
<p>But Victor Carstarphen, the Democratic mayor of Camden in South Jersey, says he supports Sherrill's plans to build more housing and freeze rising energy costs.</p> <p>"Listen, she's talked about these utilities, and how these utilities is going up higher and higher, and that affects a community like Camden," he says. "She hits it spot on with that."</p> <p>In June, New Jerseyans' electricity bills surged 17% to 20% depending on their provider, according to the state Board of Public Utilities.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Karine Jean-Pierre on why she left the Democrats — and calls herself independent</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>For nearly three years, Karine Jean-Pierre served as White House press secretary, the public face of the Biden administration through daily briefings and trips around the world.</p> <p>In a new book,<em> Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines</em>, published Oct. 21, Jean-Pierre says that the party's internal dysfunction and disloyalty had helped pave the way for its 2024 defeat.</p> <p>Speaking with <em>Morning Edition </em>host Michel Martin, she reflected on her time in the administration and described why she decided to step away from the party she once represented.</p> <p>Here are five takeaways from the conversation.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">1. She says the debate revealed political vulnerability — not cognitive decline</h3> <p>Jean-Pierre opened her book with her account of the June 2024 presidential debate, the night questions about former President Joe Biden's health and acuity intensified.</p> <p>" I had not seen the president because he had been in debate prep," she said. "So the first time I actually heard him speak was while he was debating. So when I heard his voice, I thought to myself, uh oh. He was hoarse. He kind of looked like he was sick."</p> <p>She said she immediately recognized how the optics might play publicly. "Everything that I've been pushing back on — his age, is he fit — like automatically anytime he would sneeze or have a runny nose or something would happen, that would be where the questions would go."</p> <p>Still, she maintained she had seen no reason to doubt the president's ability to serve. "I stand by that. I stand by that 110%."</p> <h3 class="edTag">2. She blames, in part, Democratic disunity for Trump's return</h3> <p>Jean-Pierre argued that Democrats' inability to rally around Biden cost them politically.</p> <p>"Joe Biden, objectively, had a very successful four years," she said. "And here we are on the cusp of an election of a lifetime that we all need to get behind our person, and we couldn't do it. Republicans are able to do it … and we weren't able to do it."</p>
<p>She cited figures such as Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney who, she said, signaled their doubts about the president. "All of it," she said, "contributed to a perception of disunity."</p> <h3 class="edTag">3. She says criticism of her as press secretary reflected deeper bias</h3> <p>Jean-Pierre recalled the scrutiny she faced at the podium, including claims she was "too wooden" or lacked policy depth.</p> <p>"Well, look in the moment, I was quiet," she said. "What I can do is state facts, which is that no one has ever looked like me that has been at that podium."</p> <p>She said she understood that "as a Black woman, things are just different for people who look like me."</p> <h3 class="edTag">4. She says Democrats had failed Black women — even as they relied on them</h3> <p>In a chapter titled "Sisterhood," Jean-Pierre described the loyalty of Black women voters within the party.</p> <p>"I feel like, if you look at Black women and how they come out and vote no matter what, because they understand what's at stake ... we get forgotten," she said.</p> <p>She said she had appreciated the Biden-Harris administration's effort to elevate those voices: "They felt seen when they saw me at the podium, behind that lectern, whether it was women of color, Black women, queer community, LGBTQ community, immigrant — they felt seen, and that mattered to me."</p> <h3 class="edTag">5. She says becoming an independent was about accountability, not defection</h3> <p>Jean-Pierre said her decision to identify as an independent was meant to start a conversation about the direction of American politics.</p> <p>"Look for me, I'm not telling people, Hey, you go become an independent," she said. "There is a growing number of people who see themselves as independents, including young people. We have to question, why is that?"</p> <p>She also said Democrats had failed to anticipate what would follow their loss.</p> <p>Jean-Pierre said she hoped the book would encourage engagement rather than cynicism.</p>
<p>"There's an opportunity to reimagine what politics can be, to reimagine what America can be. That means you can't stay quiet, because silence is complicit."</p> <p><em>The radio version of this interview was produced by Barry Gordemer and edited by Adriana Gallardo.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Japan's parliament elects Sanae Takaichi as nation's first female prime minister</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>TOKYO — Japan's parliament elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the country's first female prime minister Tuesday, a day after her struggling party struck a coalition deal with a new partner expected to pull her governing bloc further to the right.</p> <p>Takaichi replaces Shigeru Ishiba, ending a three-month political vacuum and wrangling since the Liberal Democratic Party's disastrous election loss in July.</p> <p>Ishiba, who lasted only one year as prime minister, resigned with his Cabinet earlier in the day, paving the way for his successor.</p> <p>Takaichi won 237 votes — four more than a majority — compared to 149 won by Yoshikoko Noda, head of the largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, in the lower house, which elects the prime minister. As the results were announced, Takaichi stood up and bowed deeply.</p>
<p>The LDP's alliance with the Osaka-based rightwing Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin no Kai, ensured her premiership because the opposition is not united. Takaichi's untested alliance is still short of a majority in both houses of parliament and will need to court other opposition groups to pass any legislation — a risk that could make her government unstable and short-lived.</p>
<p>The two parties signed a coalition agreement on policies underscoring Takaichi's hawkish and nationalistic views.</p> <p>Their last-minute deal came after the Liberal Democrats lost its longtime partner, the Buddhist-backed Komeito, which has a more dovish and centrist stance. The breakup threatened a change of power for the LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted for decades.</p> <p>Tackling rising prices and other economic measures is the top priority for the Takaichi government, LDP Secretary General Shunichi Suzuki told NHK public television as he apologized over the delay because of the party's internal power struggle since the July election. He said the new coalition will cooperate with other opposition parties to quickly tackle rising prices to "live up to the expectations of the people."</p> <p>Later in the day, Takaichi, 64, will present a Cabinet with a number of allies of LDP's most powerful kingmaker, Taro Aso, and others who backed her in the party leadership vote.</p>
<p>JIP will not hold ministerial posts in Takaichi's Cabinet until his party is confident about its partnership with the LDP, Yoshimura said.</p> <p>Takaichi is running on deadline, as she prepares for a major policy speech later this week, talks with U.S. President Donald Trump and regional summits. She needs to quickly tackle rising prices and compile economy-boosting measures by late December to address public frustration.</p> <p>While she is the first woman serving as Japan's prime minister, she is in no rush to promote gender equality or diversity.</p> <p>Takaichi is among Japanese politicians who have stonewalled measures for women's advancement. Takaichi supports the imperial family's male-only succession and opposes same-sex marriage and allowing separate surnames for married couples.</p> <p>A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is expected to emulate his policies including a stronger military and economy, as well as revising Japan's pacifist constitution. With her potentially weak grip on power, it's unknown how much Takaichi will be able to achieve.</p> <p>Also an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi was first elected to parliament in 1993 and has served in a number of senior party and government posts, including as ministers of economic security and internal affairs, but her diplomatic background is thin.</p> <p>When Komeito left the governing coalition, it cited the LDP's lax response to slush fund scandals that led to their consecutive election defeats.</p> <p>The centrist party also raised concern about Takaichi's revisionist view of Japan's wartime past and her regular prayers at Yasukuni Shrine despite protests from Beijing and Seoul that see the visits as lack of remorse about Japanese aggression, as well as her recent xenophobic remarks.</p> <p>Takaichi has toned down her hawkish rhetoric. On Friday, she sent a religious ornament instead of going to Yasukuni.</p>

<div class="article-title">American chess grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky dies at 29</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Daniel Naroditsky, a chess grandmaster who started as a child prodigy and quickly became one of the most influential American voices in the sport, died Monday. He was 29.</p> <p>The Charlotte Chess Center in North Carolina, where Naroditsky trained and worked as a coach, announced his death on social media, calling him "a talented chess player, educator, and beloved member of the chess community."</p> <p>"Let us remember Daniel for his passion and love for the game of chess, and for the joy and inspiration he brought to us all every day," his family said in a statement shared by the center.</p>
<p>The cause of death was not immediately known.</p> <p>Naroditsky became a grandmaster, the highest title in chess aside from World Chess Champion, at the age of 18.</p>
<p>Years earlier, the California-born player won the Under 12 world championship and spent his teenage years writing chess strategy books as he climbed the world rankings.</p> <p>He was consistently ranked in the top 200 worldwide for traditional chess and also excelled at a fast-paced style called blitz chess, maintaining a top 25 ranking throughout his adult career. Most recently Naroditsky, known to many as Danya, won the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August.</p> <p>Fellow grandmasters credited Naroditsky with introducing the sport to a wider audience by livestreaming many of his matches and sharing live commentary on others. Thousands of people regularly tuned in on YouTube and the interactive streaming platform Twitch to watch Naroditsky play.</p> <p>"He loved streaming, and he loved trying to be educational. The chess world is very grateful," Hikaru Nakamura, an American grandmaster, said on a livestream Monday.</p> <p>In a final video posted to his YouTube channel on Friday titled "You Thought I Was Gone!?" Naroditsky tells viewers he's "back, better than ever" after taking a creative break from streaming. He talks viewers through his moves as he plays live chess matches on the computer from a cozy home studio.</p>
<p>Other elite chess players from around the globe took to social media to express their shock and sadness.</p> <p>Dutch chess grandmaster Benjamin Bok reflected on his lifelong friendship with Naroditsky, who he said he's known since the Under 12 world championship that Naroditsky won in 2007.</p>
<p>"I still can't believe it and don't want to believe it," Bok said on X. "It was always a privilege to play, train, and commentate with Danya, but above all, to call him my friend."</p> <p>Naroditsky was the son of Jewish immigrants to the U.S. from Ukraine and Azerbaijan. He was born and raised in San Mateo County, California, and was described by his parents as a very serious kid with an impressive attention span and memory. He went on to study history at Stanford University, earning a bachelor's degree in 2019 after taking a year off to play in chess tournaments.</p> <p>After college, he moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he coached the area's top junior chess players.</p>

<div class="article-title">Miami Beach puts the art in offshore artificial reef</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>MIAMI — In a warehouse, Colin Foord is a doting father overseeing a coral nursery. </p>
<p>His charges are a type of soft coral called gorgonians. "They're a fundamentally important part of the Caribbean and Floridian coral reef habitat," he says.</p> <p>Foord tends to more than 2,000 tiny soft coral specimens growing in several large saltwater tanks. In each one, snails and hermit crabs help keep it free of algae. There are sea fans, sea whips and other species, some of which will eventually grow as big as six feet tall when they're transplanted onto a major new project that's beginning to take shape in the Atlantic Ocean near Miami Beach.</p>
<p>When complete, "Reefline" will be a seven-mile-long artificial reef within swimming distance of the beach. It's an art installation, a restoration of the island's coral habitat, and an underwater tourist attraction. Plans call for it to extend the entire length of Miami Beach. The reef will be made up of a series of art installations, sculptures that are being cast from marine-grade concrete.</p>
<p>Foord's passion for raising corals, the colorful colonies of tiny animals that build massive underwater reefs, is rooted in both science and art. He's one of the founders of "Coral Morphologic," an arts and science group devoted to researching and documenting coral reefs.</p> <p>At his lab here, he collects and grows the corals that will be transplanted onto the Reefline project. Within a few years, the underwater concrete sculpture garden will be transformed into a colorful, living coral reef. "It's only going to be in about 15 to 20 feet of water, about 700 feet off of Miami Beach," he says. "So, anybody with a mask and fins will be able to go right out there and see it with their own eyes without even a boat."</p> <p>Reefline's origins began several years ago when Foord was talking to arts curator Ximena Caminos. Caminos, originally from Argentina, calls herself a cultural placemaker. She's overseen projects that have used the arts to revitalize neighborhoods in Buenos Aires and Miami Beach.</p>
<p>She's turning that vision offshore to develop an ecotourism attraction that, half-jokingly, she calls public housing for fish. "We 're giving them, for free, new homes, fabulous artistic penthouses underwater where they can thrive," she says. "They're not so different from us at the end, you know. They also need a home."</p>
<p>Reefline is funded in part by the city of Miami Beach through a $5 million bond approved by voters. Caminos, the project's artistic director, is spearheading a campaign to raise $6 million more to fund its first phase.</p> <p>That gets underway this month. It will be an installation of 22 cars, cast from concrete and arranged in an underwater traffic jam. "The cars…have the perfect morphology to plant corals," she says. "The cars are kind of like flowerpots for corals. They're perfect."</p>
<p>This part of Reefline is the work of Leandro Ehrlich, one of several internationally-known artists who's contributing to the project. He says the corals, once they're transplanted, will transform the underwater sculptures. "I think over time, the cars are going to disappear under the growth of coral," Ehrlich says. "And I think this is really fantastic."</p> <p>The Reefline project will actually bring back to Miami Beach something it used to have. Until the 1970s, the island had an offshore coral reef. Over time, it was smothered by sand brought in to replenish the beach. Foord says, "Reefline is going to be able to…renew and recreate what used to be there." On the new artificial reef, Foord is planning to use resilient corals collected locally that can withstand disease and warming ocean temperatures.</p>
<p>Caminos anticipates that completing the seven-mile-long project will take at least a decade. Part of the project will be an onshore marine learning center to educate visitors about the planet's endangered coral reefs. She says the underwater sculptures, covered by coral, are intended to be visible from the air as people fly into Miami. She's hopeful that one of the installations' next phase, a constellation of 57 giant sculpted starfish, may even one day become a symbol for the city.</p>

<p>The Toronto Blue Jays, with a 4-3 win in Monday night's American League Championship Series Game 7 over the Seattle Mariners, are headed back to the World Series for the first time in more than 30 years.</p> <p>Their opponent: the $340 million buzzsaw known as the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>
<p>With the biggest payroll in baseball, the Dodgers are baseball's most successful franchise in recent years, with two World Series titles and five National League pennants over the past nine seasons. Now, they are four wins away from becoming the sport's first repeat champions in a quarter century.</p> <p>The Blue Jays emerged in July as one of the best teams in baseball and ended the season 94-68 on top of the AL East, a remarkable turnaround from 2024's last-place finish in the division. In the ALDS, Toronto's bats overwhelmed their division rival New York Yankees, pouring on 34 runs over four games.</p>
<p>Still, Toronto needed all seven games of the ALCS to return to the World Series. The Mariners took the Blue Jays to the brink with 14 home runs and some dominant pitching performances that helped them jump out to a 2-0 series lead.</p> <p>But the Mariners, the only MLB franchise to have never reached the World Series, cracked as the pressure mounted late in the series. With a 3-2 series lead, needing just one win for their first-ever pennant, the Mariners committed three errors in a Game 6 loss, then, after taking a 3-1 lead in Game 7, allowed a late three-run home run by Toronto's George Springer to dash their hopes again.</p> <p>"It was never a doubt that one of these guys was going to come through. It was just a matter of when," said Toronto pitcher Jeff Hoffman in a TV interview with Fox after the game. "We kept it close enough for long enough, and they did."</p> <p>It is Toronto's first trip to the World Series since 1993, when the Blue Jays won back-to-back titles.</p>
<p>By contrast, the 93-69 Dodgers stumbled at times during the regular season, including several late-game collapses by a shaky bullpen and a humbling September sweep by the last-place Pittsburgh Pirates.</p>
<p>But in the postseason, Los Angeles has looked unstoppable. In the NLDS, the 96-66 Philadelphia Phillies managed only a single win over the Dodgers. And in the NLCS, Los Angeles swept the 97-65 Milwaukee Brewers.</p> <p>The Dodgers' crown jewel, the two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani, single-handedly powered Los Angeles to their Game 4 NLCS-clinching victory with three home runs as a batter and, as starting pitcher, 6.1 shutout innings with 10 strikeouts — a performance so herculean that it was instantly in the conversation for the greatest individual game of all-time.</p>
<p>In other words, the Dodgers are firing on every cylinder — and they will be an even bigger challenge for Toronto than Seattle. The Blue Jays excel at putting balls into play, which worked to their advantage in the ALCS. But Los Angeles is a better defensive team than the Mariners, and their starting pitchers are a level above, too.</p> <p>But Los Angeles does have a weakness: their bullpen, which lost plenty of games for the Dodgers in the second half of the season. The Blue Jays could have an opportunity there if they can put more pressure on the Dodgers' starters than the Brewers did (just two earned runs over four games).</p> <p>Game 1 of the World Series is set for Friday, Oct. 24, in Toronto.</p>

<div class="article-title">The White House starts demolishing part of the East Wing to build Trump's ballroom</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>WASHINGTON — The White House on Monday started tearing down part of the East Wing, the traditional base of operations for the first lady, to build President Trump's $250 million ballroom despite lacking approval for construction from the federal agency that oversees such projects.</p>
<p>Dramatic photos of the demolition work showed construction equipment tearing into the East Wing façade and windows and other building parts in tatters on the ground. Some reporters watched from a park near the Treasury Department, which is next to the East Wing.</p> <p>Trump announced the start of construction in a social media post and referenced the work while hosting 2025 college baseball champs Louisiana State University and LSU-Shreveport in the East Room. He noted the work was happening "right behind us."</p>
<p>"We have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically," he said, adding, "It just started today."</p> <p>The White House has moved ahead with the massive construction project despite not yet having sign-off from the National Capital Planning Commission, which approves construction work and major renovations to government buildings in the Washington area.</p>
<p>Its chairman, Will Scharf, who is also the White House staff secretary and one of Trump's top aides, said at the commission's September meeting that agency does not have jurisdiction over demolition or site preparation work for buildings on federal property.</p> <p>"What we deal with is essentially construction, vertical build," Scharf said last month.</p> <p>It was unclear whether the White House had submitted the ballroom plans for the agency's review and approval. The White House did not respond to a request for comment and the commission's offices are closed because of the government shutdown.</p> <p>The Republican president had said in July when the project was announced that the ballroom would not interfere with the mansion itself.</p> <p>"It'll be near it but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of," he said of the White House.</p>
<p>The East Wing houses several offices, including those of the first lady. It was built in 1902 and has been renovated over the years, with a second story added in 1942, according to the White House.</p> <p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said those East Wing offices will be temporarily relocated during construction and that wing of the building will be modernized and renovated.</p>
<p>"Nothing will be torn down," Leavitt said when she announced the project in July.</p> <p>Trump insists that presidents have desired such a ballroom for 150 years and that he's adding the massive 90,000-square-foot, glass-walled space because the East Room, which is the largest room in the White House with an approximately 200-person capacity, is too small. He also has said he does not like the idea of hosting kings, queens, presidents and prime ministers in pavilions on the South Lawn.</p> <p>Trump said in the social media announcement that the project would be completed "with zero cost to the American Taxpayer! The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly."</p> <p>The ballroom will be the biggest structural change to the Executive Mansion since the addition in 1948 of the Truman Balcony overlooking the South Lawn, even dwarfing the residence itself.</p> <p>At a dinner he hosted last week for some of the wealthy business executives who are donating money toward the $250 million construction cost, Trump said the project had grown in size and now will accommodate 999 people. The capacity was 650 seated people at the July announcement.</p> <p>The White House has said it will disclose information on who has contributed money to build the ballroom, but has yet to do so.</p> <p>Trump also said at last week's event that the head of Carrier Global Corp., a leading manufacturer of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, had offered to donate the air conditioning system for the ballroom.</p>
<p>Carrier confirmed to The Associated Press on Monday that it had done so. A cost estimate was not immediately available.</p> <p>"Carrier is honored to provide the new iconic ballroom at the White House with a world-class, energy-efficient HVAC system, bringing comfort to distinguished guests and dignitaries in this historic setting for years to come," the company said in an emailed statement.</p> <p>The clearing of trees on the south grounds and other site preparation work started in September. Plans call for the ballroom to be ready before Trump's term ends in January 2029.</p>

<div class="article-title">Outage at Amazon Web Services disrupts websites across the internet</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A massive outage at Amazon Web Services disrupted major websites and apps on Monday, in a show of how one company's online infrastructure has become essential for many modern businesses to function.</p> <p>Amazon said it was fixing the problem, but some disruptions were still ongoing as of Monday evening.</p> <p>Tech experts tell NPR the incident highlights just how vulnerable companies are to these kinds of outages.</p> <p>Here's what to know about what happened and why a single outage could be so damaging.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">The outage started early Monday</h3> <p>Amazon reported "increased error rates and latencies" starting around 3 a.m. ET that involved its facility in Northern Virginia.</p> <p>Users reported trouble with popular websites and apps including Duolingo and the online games Roblox and Fortnite. Financial service companies like Coinbase, Robinhood and Venmo also reported disruptions, as did the companies that operate the chatbots Perplexity and ChatGPT. Amazon said its main website was affected. United Airlines, Canva, Reddit and Flickr also acknowledged problems with their websites. The Associated Press, NPR and <em>The New York Times</em>' Games also said they had issues.</p> <p>Amazon said late Monday that it was making "progress" to restoring full functionality.</p> <h3 class="edTag">How Amazon's cloud computing powers much of the internet</h3> <p>Amazon's cloud computing service, AWS, is like an invisible scaffolding that helps much of the internet function.</p> <p>AWS lets companies store and manage data online using its database service DynamoDB, which was the service affected by the outage.</p> <p>"In other words, they rent out their cloud computing resources to others so they can serve their own customers," says Chang Lou,<strong> </strong>an assistant professor at the University of Virginia who specializes in cloud computing.</p> <p>An early-morning software update to DynamoDB, however, contained an error, which took down the service in Northern Virginia. The error within that update then caused a chain reaction of service failures and disruptions.</p>
<p>Amazon says it has invested more than $50 billion in data centers in the state, which is home to the largest cluster of data centers in the United States.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Amazon's importance in cloud computing is a mixed bag for customers</h3> <p>According to Synergy Research Group, AWS holds about 30% of the worldwide cloud computing market. Other big players are Microsoft and Google.</p> <p>Betsy Cooper, a cybersecurity expert and the director of the Aspen Institute's Policy Academy, says there are pros and cons to companies using Amazon or another big provider for cloud computing. They offer strong cybersecurity protections and convenience.</p>
<p>"We all have an incentive to use the big companies, because they're so ubiquitous and it's easier for us to access all of our data in one place."</p> <p>But, she says, there's a downside.</p> <p>"That's great until something goes wrong, and then you really see just how dependent you are on a handful of those companies."</p> <p><em>Editor's note:</em> <em>Amazon is a financial supporter of NPR, and it pays to distribute some of NPR's content. Microsoft and Google are also NPR financial supporters.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Hollywood pushes OpenAI for consent</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>OpenAI says it has released new policies for an artificial intelligence tool called Sora 2, in response to concerns from Hollywood studios, unions and talent agencies.</p> <p>The tool allows users to create realistic, high-quality audio and video, using text prompts and images.</p> <p>"It's about creating new possibilities," OpenAI promised in a promotional video for Sora 2. "You can view the power to step into any world or scene, and letting your friends cast you in theirs."</p> <p>But with Sora 2, some creators have also made fake AI-generated videos of historical figures doing things they never did. For example, Martin Luther King, Jr. changing his "I Have a Dream" speech, Michael Jackson, rapping and stealing someone's chicken nuggets, or Mr. Rogers greeting rapper Tupac Shakur to his neighborhood.</p>
<p>Some videos reimagined the late Robin Williams talking on a park bench and in other locations. His daughter Zelda begged fans to stop sending her such AI-generated content, calling it "horrible slop."</p> <p>"You're not making art," she wrote on Instagram, "You're making disgusting, over-processed hotdogs out of the lives of human beings."</p>
<p>"It's kind of cool, it's kind of scary," says actress Chaley Rose, who's best known for her role in the TV series <em>Nashville</em>. "People can borrow from actors, our vulnerability and our art to teach the characters they create how to do what we do. I would hate to have my image out there and not have given permission or to actually be the one doing the acting and having control over the performance."</p> <p>Hollywood's top talent agencies first sounded the alarm.</p> <p>"There is no substitute for human talent in our business, and we will continue to fight tirelessly for our clients to ensure that they are protected," United Talent Agency wrote in a statement last week. "When it comes to OpenAI's Sora or any other platform that seeks to profit from our clients' intellectual property and likeness, we stand with artists. The future of industries based on creative expression and artistry relies on controls, protections, and rightful compensation. The use of such property without consent, credit or compensation is exploitation, not innovation."</p>
<p>Creative Artists Agency issued a similar warning last week. </p> <p>Last year, California's governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill requiring the consent of actors and performers to use their digital replicas.</p> <p>Now, the talent agencies and SAG-AFTRA (which also represents many NPR employees) announced they and OpenAI are supporting similar federal legislation, called the "NO FAKES" Act.</p> <p>Until now, some of the videos created using Sora 2 have relied on copyrighted material. For instance, there's a video that shows the animated character SpongeBob Squarepants cooking up illicit drugs.</p>
<p>The Motion Picture Association, which represents major Hollywood studios, said in a statement that since Sora 2's release, "videos that infringe our members' films, shows, and characters have proliferated on OpenAI's service and across social media."</p>
<p>Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director of the union SAG-AFTRA told NPR last week that it wasn't feasible for rightsholders to find every possible use of their material.</p> <p>"It's a moment of real concern and danger for everyone in the entertainment industry. And it should be for all Americans, all of us, really," says Crabtree-Ireland. </p> <p>SAG-AFTRA says actor Bryan Cranston alerted the union to possible abuses. Now, the union and talent agencies say they're grateful OpenAI listened to such concerns. </p> <p>The company has announced an "opt-in" policy allowing all artists, performers, and individuals the right to determine how and whether they can be simulated. OpenAI says it will block the generation of well-known characters on its public feed and will take down any existing material not in compliance.</p> <p>Last week, OpenAI agreed to take down phony videos of Martin Luther King, Jr., after his estate complained about the "disrespectful depictions" of the late civil rights leader.</p>
