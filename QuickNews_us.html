<div class="article-title">MORNING GLORY: October is the best month for baseball</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Baseball history was just made by the Cleveland Guardians. The Detroit Tigers (87-75) led the Guardians (88-74) by 9.5 games on Sept. 10 with 16 games left to play (Cleveland had 17), but finished 3-13, while Cleveland went 14-3.</p><p>At one point in July, the Guards were 15.5 games behind the Tigers, making Cleveland’s comeback the greatest ever since divisional play came to MLB in 1969. The prior record was the 15 game comeback by the Yankees to take the American League Eastern Division in 1978 after trailing the Boston Red Sox by 14 games. It’s been a remarkable September for the Guardians, truly one of a kind. (And for the Tigers, though of exactly the opposite kind.)</p><p>Because the baseball gods have a sense of humor, Cleveland will host Detroit in a best of three games series beginning today at a little after 1 PM ET. The second game (and a third, if necessary, will start at the same time and at the same place.)</p><p>So yes, we Guardians fans are pretty excited. I have plenty of friends who tweak me by calling the Guardians by their old name, "the Indians" and by their old nickname, the Tribe — and my muscle memory takes over sometimes and I use the old name and nickname too. </p><p>But I cheer for clubs, not nicknames. So do the vast majority of Cleveland fans. Tweak away in the comments. I don’t care. The Guardians are still hosting the Tigers, starting today a little past 1 PM ET today from Progressive Field at the corner of Carnegie and Ontario in Cleveland. Tom Hamilton ("Hammy") will be calling the games and he’s the best in the business. Terry Pluto will be writing about the games along with Paul Hoynes and Joe Noga and maybe Jimmy Watkins over at Cleveland.com. Northeast Ohio takes its professional clubs very seriously, so the local news outlets devote resources to serving the fan base and the vast diaspora of Cleveland fans keep those platforms afloat and not because of political controversies in Cuyahoga County. </p><p>An aside: I met my wife in the fall of 1978 at a fundraiser for then San Diego mayor Pete Wilson. She has endured decades of Cleveland Browns, Cleveland Cavaliers and Cleveland Indians/Guardians seasons since. There has been a total of one championship in those years (the Cavs won a stunning upset over the Golden State Warriors in 2016), so sports widows and widowers of the last half century, buckle up. Your spouse is going to be a bit crazy again for at least this week. And brace yourself. You know the dark clouds descend and they last a few days. But perhaps not this fall!</p><p>Cleveland hasn’t won a World Series in my lifetime, last doing so in 1948. They have come close in 1995, 1997 and 2016, but close doesn’t get you a ring. (They also won it all in 1920 and lost it in 1954, but as I didn’t have to watch the collapse of 1954 I am as indifferent to that as to the 1920 and 1948 triumphs.) </p><p>The Browns have never been to a Super Bowl. They last won the NFL Championship in 1964. The Cavs are pretty good right now, but they have never won it all without LeBron James. So there are skeptics. But it could possibly be two championships in the cycle. (The Browns are not in the hunt absent a miraculous emergence of rookie QBs Dillon Gabriel or Shedeur Sanders.)  </p><p>THE Ohio State University has provided some relief, claiming national championships in college football in 1968, 1970, 2002, 2014 and the most recent one after the 2024 regular season, running the gauntlet of four playoff games for the first time in the sport’s history. They could even repeat. </p><p>But professional sports in Cleveland? It’s been a desert with one oasis for 50 years.</p><p>Which is a long way of explaining to you that there may be mood swings among your colleagues this week (and maybe longer) if the Guards’ run goes on. You may not know they are from Ohio, though we usually tell you. And we are certainly going to tell you this week and beyond for as long as "Guards Ball" goes on. </p><p>Cleveland has the best fan base in the country and the longest suffering. So put up with us this October. We couldn’t quite believe September. But it’s very much Believeland this month.  </p><p><i>Hugh Hewitt is host of "The Hugh Hewitt Show," heard weekday mornings 6am to 9am ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

<div class="article-title">Top GOP senator steps up efforts to protect Republican majority in 2026 midterms</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the number three Republican in Senate leadership, is turning up the volume on his effort to protect and strengthen the GOP's majority in the chamber in next year's elections.</p><p>A non-profit public advocacy group aligned with the senator on Tuesday launched an ad highlighting GOP Rep. Ashley Hinson of Iowa, who's running in the 2026 race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Joni Ernst.</p><p>The ad is the latest effort by Cotton, the Army veteran who served in combat in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars before becoming a rising GOP star, to support Republicans in key Senate races in next year's midterm elections when the party will be defending its 53-47 majority in the chamber.</p><p>"Iowa has a fighter in Washington. Her name is Ashley Hinson," says the narrator in the spot by America One Policies, which was first shared with Fox News Digital.</p><p>Hinson, a former local TV anchor, has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and by the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) as she runs to keep Iowa's open Senate seat in the party's hands.</p><p>The narrator highlights that Hinson "is tough on crime, and she's tough on China. Ashley fought to stop China from buying our farmland, and she voted for President Trump's tax cuts."</p><p>"Ashley Hinson is putting more money in your pocket. Tell her to keep fighting for Iowa," the narrator adds.</p><p>The Cotton-aligned group tells Fox News that it will spend six-figures to run the ad on broadcast TV and digital in the Des Moines market.</p><p>It's the second spot this cycle by America One Policies following an ad that targets Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, whom Republicans consider the most vulnerable Democratic senator running for re-election in 2026.</p><p>And earlier this month, Cotton's leadership PAC went up with an ad that takes aim at North Carolina's former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who's running against former Republican National Committee chair Michael Whately in the race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Thom Tillis.</p><p>An America One Polices spokesperson told Fox News that "Senator Cotton plans to fight for his colleagues in the US Senate, to ensure that we grow our majority in the senate, to fundraise and advertise for our candidates and to make sure that the American people know the records of their Democrat opponents. American One Policies will be assisting our candidates across the United States throughout this election cycle."  </p><p>Cotton, who didn't face a Democratic Party opponent as he cruised to re-election in 2020 and who isn't expected to face a difficult re-election next year in red state Arkansas, has crisscrossed the country in recent election cycles to campaign on behalf of fellow Republicans.</p><p>"As Tom Cotton has done since the first day he was elected to office, he will continue to help support Republicans around the country who are running for office at any level, to win," a source in the senator's political orbit told Fox News Digital.</p><p>The 48-year-old Cotton took a hard look at running for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination as he made numerous trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states that have long kicked off the GOP's presidential primary calendar.</p><p>But days before the 2022 midterms, Cotton announced he wouldn't run for the White House in 2024. </p><p>And last year, Cotton was considered to be on now-President Donald Trump's larger list of potential running mates.</p><p>Cotton's support for Hinson in Iowa may spark speculation about a potential future run by the senator for the White House.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Kennedy Center president criticizes Jimmy Kimmel's one-sided late-night programming approach</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> - Kennedy Center President Ric Grenell blamed Jimmy Kimmel's one-sided rhetoric for his temporary late-night TV suspension on Saturday at the Kennedy Center Gala benefiting the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO).</p><p>Both Sinclair and Nexstar announced last week they would resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after sidelining the program due to the comedian's comments about Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin, which attempted to link him to the MAGA movement.</p><p>Grenell said Disney made a necessary business decision by benching the late-night host.</p><p>"Look, I think from the beginning Disney made decisions because Jimmy was losing tens of millions of dollars every year," Grenell said in a red carpet interview with Fox News Digital, although the show's exact financial worth when taking into account its online presence is unknown. "And I don’t think we should have DEI programming just because people are afraid of political blowback."</p><p>"You should be able to make decisions… We just saw this week The New York Times highlight how Broadway is dying," he continued. "People are not buying tickets. We’ve got to do something in the offset to change that trajectory. And I think studios, and broadcast studios, anyone who’s involved in entertainment, has to be able to bring programming that people want."</p><p>In the report Grenell referenced, "The Broadway musical is in trouble," the paper noted that all 18 commercial musicals that opened on Broadway last season have yet to turn a profit. </p><p>"The new musicals ‘Tammy Faye,’ ‘Boop!’ and ‘Smash’ each cost at least $20 million to bring to the stage, and each was gone less than four months after opening," according to the Times. "All three lost their entire investments."</p><p>The Times suggested rising production costs are partly to blame for Broadway’s challenges, while Grenell pointed to Kimmel’s "one-sided" humor as the reason his late-night show has struggled.</p><p>"Let’s be honest," Grenell said. "Everybody knows that Jimmy Kimmel is losing money because he has guests that are just one side of the aisle. All his jokes are on one side of the aisle. And you’re just not going to make money when you take 50 percent of the customers off the table."</p><p>Grenell added that the Kennedy Center had similar struggles before his tenure. While the current leadership has not canceled any performances under his watch, several artists have chosen to bow out since the so-called "Trump takeover."</p><p>"And so we want to have a very strong message that says everyone is welcome here," Grenell said. "We have not canceled a single show. There have been some who have walked away because they don’t want to perform for Republicans. I say shame on that intolerance. Everyone should be welcome here, and we should not care who you voted for."</p><p>Kennedy Center board member Mary Helen Bowers, who joined the board in 2020 under President Donald Trump, said she wasn't a fan of Kimmel's controversial comments but also cited finances as the impetus for his suspension.</p><p>"Well, I thought his comments were disgusting and vile and Charlie Kirk is a great hero," Bowers told Fox News Digital. "But I think that, from my understanding of it, if his numbers were bad, and he wasn’t performing, then he shouldn’t be on the air."</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Disney for comment.</p><p>"The focus is on pleasing the audience," Bowers said of the current Kennedy Center leadership. "And that’s what the arts is really about. It’s about creating beauty and creating a great experience, but with Grenell’s leadership, he’s very focused on the bottom line and the financial health of the center, which is tremendously important, especially in this time."</p><p>The NSO is celebrating its 95th anniversary season. Featured works at Saturday's concert included Aaron Copland's "Fanfare for the Common Man," Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's "Capriccio Espagnol" and Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's "Piano Concerto No.1." The Kennedy Center Gala raised a total of $3.45 million, nearly triple what the NSO has raised in previous years. About half of those in attendance were first-time Gala guests.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Five races to watch with 5 weeks to go until Election Day 2025</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>With five weeks to go until Election Day, polls indicate a very close contest in the battle for New Jersey governor.</p><p>New Jersey is just one of two states, along with Virginia, that hold statewide elections for governor this November. And the contests, which traditionally grab outsized national attention, are viewed as crucial early tests of President Donald Trump's popularity and agenda, and key barometers ahead of next year's midterm showdowns for the U.S. House and Senate.</p><p>Also in the political spotlight this November is the ballot box proposition over congressional redistricting in California, the three state Supreme Court contests in battleground Pennsylvania, and New York City's high-profile mayoral election.</p><p>Democrats, who are aiming to exit the political wilderness following last year's election setbacks when they lost control of the White House and Senate and failed to win back the House majority, are highlighting their success so far this year in special elections.</p><p>"There's wind at our back," Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Ken Martin recently touted. "We have overperformed in every single election that's been on the ballot since Donald Trump was inaugurated."</p><p>But Republicans point to the multitude of problems facing the Democratic Party.</p><p>"Sadly for the DNC, the truth is that Democrats' approval rating is at a 30-year low as the party has hemorrhaged more than 2 million voters over the past four years," Republican National Committee communications director Zach Parkinson told Fox News Digital recently.</p><p>Here's a closer look at 2025's top elections.</p><p>He's not on the ballot, but Trump and his unprecedented second-term agenda weigh heavily on this year's ballot box battle for governor of New Jersey.</p><p>And Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli, who enjoys the president's support, says Democratic nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill is trying to use Trump as a cudgel.</p><p>"Listen, if you get a flat tire on the way home from work today, she's going to blame it on the president. There isn't anything she doesn't blame on the president," Ciattarelli argued, as he sat this week for an interview with Fox News Digital.</p><p>Sherrill, in a recent fundraising email to supporters, charged, "As Trump has inflicted all this damage on our country, Republican politicians like Jack Ciattarelli have cheered him on every step of the way."</p><p>And at their first debate a week and a half ago, she pointed to Ciattarelli and claimed that "he’ll do whatever Trump tells him to do."</p><p>The combustible ballot box battle in New Jersey was rocked last week after a report revealed that the United States Naval Academy blocked her from taking part in her 1994 graduation amid a cheating scandal.</p><p>Ciattarelli and his campaign are calling on Sherrill, who went on to pilot helicopters during her military career after graduating from the Naval Academy, to release her military records to explain why she was blocked from attending her graduation ceremony.</p><p>"What we learned today is that she was part of it in some way, shape or form. Come clean, release the records. Tell us what's in your disciplinary records. I think the people of New Jersey deserve that," Ciattarelli said Thursday night in an interview on Fox News' "Hannity."</p><p>But a second report revealed that the National Personnel Records Center, which is a branch of the National Archives and Records Administration, errantly released Sherrill's improperly redacted military personnel files, which included private information including her social security number, to a Ciattarelli ally. </p><p>The news spurred calls by top Democrats across the country for an investigation.</p><p>"To have a guy I'm running against, it will stop at nothing, it will stop at nothing, who will illegally obtain records. It's just beyond the pale," Sherrill, who served as a federal prosecutor before winning election to Congress, charged Thursday night on the campaign trail in Plainfield, New Jersey.</p><p>The two candidates face off next week in the second and final debate in the race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.</p><p>Ciattarelli, who is making his third straight run for governor and who came close to upsetting Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy four years ago, discounted talk that Trump is the dominant issue in the race.</p><p>And Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker and a certified public accountant who started a medical publishing company before getting into politics, charged that the Democrats are to blame, as he works overtime trying to link Sherrill to Murphy and the Democrats who've long controlled the state legislature in Trenton.</p><p>Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is facing off against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger in the race to succeed GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</p><p>Youngkin is prevented from running for re-election, as Virginia's constitution does not allow sitting governors to seek consecutive terms.</p><p>Earle-Sears was born in the Caribbean island nation of Jamaica and immigrated to the U.S. at the age of 6. She served in the Marines and is a former state lawmaker who made history four years ago when she won election as Virginia's first female lieutenant governor. </p><p>Spanberger is a former intelligence officer in the CIA who won election to Congress in 2018 before securing re-election in 2020 and 2022.</p><p>The winner in November will make history as Virginia's first female governor in the commonwealth's four-century-long history. Additionally, if Earle-Sears comes out on top, she will become the nation's first Black woman to win election as governor.</p><p>Trump and his policies are a major issue in the state's gubernatorial showdown.</p><p>The president's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been on a mission this year to chop government spending and cut the federal workforce.</p><p>The moves by DOGE, which was initially steered by Elon Musk, the world's richest person, have been felt acutely in suburban Washington's heavily populated northern Virginia, with its large federal workforce.</p><p>The mayoral election in the nation's most populous city always grabs outsized attention, especially this year as New York City may elect its first Muslim and first millennial mayor.</p><p>Democratic socialist 33-year-old state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani's victory in June's Democratic Party mayoral primary sent political shock waves across the country. And he's come under attack from Republicans and from his rivals on the ballot over his far-left proposals.</p><p>Mamdani is the clear frontrunner in the heavily blue city as he faces off against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who came in a distant second in the primary and is now running as an independent candidate. Cuomo is aiming for a political comeback after resigning as governor four years ago amid multiple scandals.</p><p>Also running is two-time Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, a co-founder of the Guardian Angels, the non-profit, a volunteer-based community safety group.</p><p>Embattled Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who was running for re-election as an independent, dropped out of the race on Sunday, but his name remains on the ballot.</p><p>Trump, a native New Yorker, has continuously been in the spotlight in the race for months.</p><p>Voters in heavily blue California will vote in November on whether to temporarily set aside their popular nonpartisan redistricting commission and allow the Democrat-dominated legislature to determine congressional redistricting for the next three election cycles.</p><p>The vote will be the culmination of an effort by Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Democrats to create up to five left-leaning congressional seats in the Golden State to counter the new maps that conservative Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law last week, which will create up to five more right-leaning U.S. House districts in the red state of Texas.</p><p>The redistricting in Texas, which came after Trump's urging, is part of a broader effort by the GOP across the country to pad their razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.</p><p>Democrats currently hold a 5-2 majority on Pennsylvania's highest court. </p><p>But three Democrat-leaning justices on the state Supreme Court, following the completion of their 10-year terms, are running to keep their seats in "Yes" or "No" retention elections.</p><p>The election could upend the court's composition for the next decade, heavily influence whether Democrats or Republicans have an advantage in the state's congressional delegation and legislature, and impact crucial cases including voting rights and reproductive rights.</p><p>While state Supreme Court elections typically don't grab much national attention, contests where the balance of a court in a key battleground state is up for grabs have attracted tons of outside money.</p><p>The state Supreme Court showdown this spring in Wisconsin, where the 4-3 liberal majority was maintained, drew nearly $100 million in outside money as both parties poured resources into the election.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Calling in the generals: What Hegseth’s top-brass meeting should — and shouldn't — mean</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>On Tuesday, Sept. 30, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth is bringing hundreds of U.S. generals and admirals to Quantico for what amounts to a mass leadership formation. The agenda is opaque, the logistics unusual and the stakes high. With President Donald Trump now planning to attend, the gathering risks becoming as much a signal about civil-military relations as it is about readiness. What should Americans take from it — and what should our flag officers hear? </p><p>First, let’s dispense with the novelty. Large, in-person convocations of nearly the entire general and flag officer corps are rare. Reporting indicates Hegseth intends to hammer "warrior ethos," grooming and standards — an unmistakable course-correction message to a force that has struggled with recruitment, retention and public confidence. Whether or not every rumor about mass firings is overblown, the form and timing are extraordinary. </p><p>Second, size and scale matter. By Pentagon counts this summer, there are roughly 838 active-duty generals and admirals. Independent analysis notes that asking "about 800" to show up would approach the total population — hence the shock across commands. Even if the real attendance is lower due to staff exemptions, it’s still unprecedented. </p><p>Third, context matters. Trump’s decision to appear adds a political charge no speech can avoid. Some will see a morale boost, others, politicization. In a constitutional republic, civilian control of the military is not theater — it’s principle. When hundreds of flag officers assemble under cameras and floodlights, allies and adversaries alike read the optics. That’s why clarity of purpose and restraint of tone matter as much as content. </p><p>Fourth, history matters — especially the comparison so many are already making. At the end of World War II, about 12.2 million Americans were on active duty (roughly 16 million served at some point in the war), and there were a little over 2,000 general and flag officers — a ratio around 1:6,000. Today we have roughly 1.3 million active-duty personnel and about 800-840 flag officers — a ratio closer to 1:1,500. Reasonable people can debate the right number, but the trend line is undeniable: the General and Flag Officer (GO/FO) corps has grown as a share of the total force. </p><p>So, what should this meeting accomplish? </p><p>1. Put "warrior ethos" back where it belongs: in readiness, not rhetoric. Fitness standards, small-unit proficiency and combat-credible training are not partisan issues. They’re the bedrock of deterrence. If Hegseth focuses his charge on measurable outputs — deployable readiness, training reps that mimic the fight we face, and clear, published standards enforced without fear or favor — he’ll have broad support in the ranks and among taxpayers. Announcing a short list of concrete readiness metrics the services will publicly report would be a solid start. </p><p>2. Depoliticize the flag ranks — by example as much as exhortation. The surest way to keep the military out of politics is for political leaders to keep politics out of the military. That cuts both ways. The secretary can demand commanders enforce standards and shut down ideological litmus tests — from any direction. He can also reaffirm that promotions, billets and reliefs will be based on performance and warfighting requirements, not Twitter/X storms or cable-news narratives. The presence of the commander-in-chief raises the temperature; the remarks should lower it. </p><p>3. Right-size and de-layer the headquarters without hollowing the force. If reductions to general/flag billets are coming, they should be targeted at overhead and staff inflation, not the command chains we’ll need on Day One of a crisis. The department has lived through pendulum swings before. A principled framework — tie billets to mission, eliminate duplicative structures, shift resources to operational units — beats a blunt "slash the stars" headline. CRS has documented how the GO/FO share has crept up over decades even as end strength fell; use this moment to reverse bloat where it doesn’t touch combat power. </p><p>4. Speak to the strategic environment plainly. While Washington fixates on the spectacle, Beijing, Moscow and Tehran are counting cards. A mass stateside recall can be misread abroad. The message to the generals should be unambiguous: U.S. joint forces will maintain global command presence, allied obligations and crisis response timelines uninterrupted. Any reorganization must enhance, not slow, the ability to surge combat power to the Western Pacific, Europe or CENTCOM on short notice. </p><p>5) Restore trust with the country. The American people expect two things from their military: win wars and stay out of politics. The way to do both is to align words, standards, and structure with the mission. Invite public accountability — publish the metrics that matter, acknowledge where we’re short and show the plan to fix it. That transparency will calm speculation and strengthen civilian confidence. </p><p>Critics will ask why convene everyone in person when secure video exists. It’s a fair question. But if Hegseth uses the moment to set unifying, apolitical expectations; to define readiness in terms that matter to warfighters; and to start carefully trimming bureaucracy so resources flow to the edge, the meeting will be worth the disruption. If it becomes a pep rally or a purge rumor mill, it will do more harm than good. </p><p>America has always course-corrected its armed forces in eras of danger. What we cannot do is confuse showmanship for strategy. The right charge to the flag ranks is broad brush on purpose — because the mission is. Demand a tougher force, a cleaner chain of command, a leaner headquarters and a military that remembers who it serves and what it’s for. That’s a message worthy of bringing the generals home to hear.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">LIZ PEEK: Trump White House fired up about King Coal’s return to power</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced on Sept. 29 a government-led initiative to boost coal use and production in the U.S. As he told Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo in an interview: this will not sit well with the Chardonnay set. </p><p>As electricity prices soar across the U.S., thanks in part to dogged efforts by blue-state officials to dump fossil fuels, those climate-obsessed voices will be drowned out by those of struggling consumers. </p><p>Over the two decades from January 1985 through January 2005, electricity prices in the U.S. climbed by only 19%; in the following 20 years until January of this year, electricity prices exploded by more than 90%. Just this year, the price per kilowatt-hour has jumped another 6%.  </p><p>In California, the trends are even worse as Golden State residents pay almost double the average charge in the U.S. People living in New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts are similarly paying much higher prices than the national average. Why the disparity? Because Democrat-run states have purposefully shifted to high-cost and unreliable renewable energy. </p><p>In New York, as governor, Andrew Cuomo banned fracking and banned new pipelines from bringing much-needed and cheaper natural gas into his state. New Jersey and other blue states promoted similar measures, while embracing renewables like offshore wind and solar that are intermittent and therefore need backup, usually provided by natural gas. This is not efficient, and it is costly. </p><p>Unlike the Biden administration, the Trump White House understands that the demand for energy over the next few years, thanks in particular to AI and other new technologies, will expand at a pace that will truly demand an "all of the above" approach. That means not just increased oil and natural gas production, investments in solar and other renewables, but also more reliance on nuclear power and — yes — on coal.  </p><p>President Barack Obama, Biden and other climate warriors have, for years, waged war against coal, which today accounts for 15% of electricity production, down from half as recently as 2000. In 2016, then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton proudly claimed her clean energy policies would "put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business," a boneheaded remark that showed how out of touch the former first lady was with the needs of working-class Americans. At the time, there were some 70,000 coal miners in the U.S.; today, that has shrunk to 40,000. </p><p>President Donald Trump recognizes that one of the greatest assets of the United States, enhancing our ability to compete in next-generation technology, is our abundant cheap energy, and especially coal. The government’s Energy Information Administration wrote last year, "In the United States, coal resources are larger than remaining natural gas and oil resources." In addition, it reported that, "As of Jan. 1, 2024, the demonstrated reserve base (DRB) was estimated to contain 469 billion short tons of coal."  </p><p>The 2024 production was just above 500 million short tons, or less than half of the amount produced in 2008. Roughly speaking, we could double current coal output and produce at that level for hundreds of years. That is not an asset any government should ignore. </p><p>The Chinese certainly would not let such a reserve go to waste. While the U.S. and Europe sacrifice using cheap coal in favor of higher-cost renewables in their quest to cut carbon emissions, the Chinese are building coal-fired power plants as rapidly as they can, the environmental consequences be damned. </p><p>While China is opening coal plants, the U.S. has been shutting ours down. The White House will change that. The government is planning to spend $625 million, including $350 million to modernize coal plants, $175 million for coal projects that will target rural communities and some $100 million to make existing plants cleaner and more efficient. Overall, the objective is to keep more plants running, including dozens that were slated to close.  </p><p>This is not the first move made by the Trump White House to expand coal’s role in our energy system. In spring, the president signed an executive order instructing the head of the National Energy Dominance Council to designate coal as a "mineral"; the purpose was to "streamline permitting," which would allow more leasing and ultimately more production overall, and, specifically, on federal lands. The president also demanded that agencies reduce "barriers" to coal mining and "rescind any agency policies that seek to transition the nation away from coal production."  </p><p>Wright told Bartiromo that, "We’re going to export more of that coal, we’re going to use it for American industry, particularly as we reindustrialize, and it’s going to continue to provide 15%-16% of our electricity and enable us to reindustrialize and win the AI race."  </p><p>The Trump administration is not just focused on coal. It is also pushing for higher oil and natural gas production, reversing Biden’s slow-walking of drilling permits and leasing. Oil production is up about 3% this year, but that is just the beginning. </p><p>In August, the Department of the Interior proposed a new oil and gas offshore leasing plan that includes 30 auctions in the Gulf of America through 2040 and six auctions in Alaska’s Cook Inlet through 2032. That’s a far cry from the Biden administration’s plan, which scheduled a total of only three oil and gas lease sales — the minimum required by the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden leased fewer federal acres for oil and gas than any president since World War II.   </p><p>Nuclear, too, is getting a boost from the Trump White House. In May, Trump initiated a "nuclear energy renaissance," directing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline the approval process for new reactors, including setting a new 18-month deadline for licensing decisions. The goal? Increase U.S. nuclear energy capacity from around 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050.  </p><p>This "all of the above" energy renewal program — exploiting this country’s vast energy resources — may well become President Trump’s greatest legacy. We need energy to compete … and to make America great again.  </p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker on Monday accused U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers of harassing people "for not being white." </p><p>Speaking at a press conference alongside Chicago Mayor Brandon, the Democratic governor lambasted the Trump administration for sending in federal agents into the Windy City over the weekend. </p><p>"Donald Trump and [DHS Secretary] Kristi Noem and [White House Border Czar] said they were targeting the worst of the worst criminals. They lie and they continue to lie," Pritzker said, adding that "Sixty percent of the individuals that ICE has taken in Illinois this year have no criminal convictions of any kind." </p><p>"ICE is running around the Loop harassing people for not being white. Just a year ago, that was illegal in the United States. Now, ICE is making it commonplace.

<div class="article-title">Trump, Democrats locked in endless cycles of payback after Comey indictment and targeting president's enemies</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Let’s roll back the clock.</p><p>After the 2020 election, Donald Trump found himself the target of multiple investigations.</p><p>The flimsiest, and most partisan, was brought by Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, who somehow elevated the Stormy Daniels payoffs from a misdemeanor to a felony, and got a conviction.</p><p>Then there was Jack Smith, who launched two investigations — one involving classified documents, the other on allegations related to Jan. 6.</p><p>And in Georgia, Fulton County DA Fani Willis investigated Trump’s famous phone call to Brad Raffensperger — "I just want to find 11,780 votes" — and some of Trump’s lawyers, such as Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis, pleaded guilty.</p><p>Beyond that, New York AG Letitia James filed a civil suit about inflated property values that led to a fine that has since grown to half a billion dollars — a penalty so outrageous that an appeals court threw it out on grounds of cruel and unusual punishment.</p><p>And what was the mindset of the media, the Democrats and at least half the country at that time?</p><p>It was that Trump had done a lot of bad things, and if he could be successfully prosecuted before the 2024 election, he could be knocked out of the race. </p><p>But from Trump’s point of view, these were bogus cases brought by biased prosecutors — James had won election by vowing to go after him — and backed by unfair judges for the sole purpose of keeping him out of the White House.</p><p>Joe Biden may have kept hands off — Jack Smith was named special counsel by AG Merrick Garland — but to the president it was all a grand left-wing conspiracy.</p><p>And that’s why Trump feels entitled to payback.</p><p>That’s why James Comey was just indicted, with Trump firing his own U.S. attorney who believed there wasn’t enough evidence, replacing him with a loyalist whose job was to charge the former FBI director.</p><p>That’s why Tish James is now under investigation for alleged mortgage fraud, </p><p>That’s why the Trump DOJ has just subpoenaed Fani Willis’ travel records from last year, and is investigating Sen. Adam Schiff.</p><p>To Donald Trump, this is all fully justified payback.</p><p>But he’s doing exactly what was done to him — going after political enemies — and doing it out in the open. He has ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue these cases, and fast, which is weaponizing the Justice Department against those he despises, in a way that no previous president has ever done. </p><p>He pronounces these targets "guilty as hell" — that alone would be a scandal in any other administration for prejudicing a trial — and celebrates the unveiling of indictments, such as calling Comey a "sick person," a "Dirty Cop" and a "SLIMEBALL."</p><p>So how does Trump justify doing what was done to him? He doesn’t. He’s never been big on consistency. And his MAGA base supports him no matter what.</p><p>Keep in mind that the perjury allegation — based on a vague exchange about a leak to the Wall Street Journal about the Clinton Foundation, ironically — was investigated by special counsel John Durham in the first term, and by the DOJ’s inspector general, and neither brought charges.</p><p>When Erik Seibert, the U.S. attorney in Virginia’s Eastern District, found insufficient evidence to charge Comey, Bondi pushed back in defense of the 15-year veteran, Still, Trump replaced him with White House aide and onetime beauty queen Lindsey Halligan, his former lawyer, who has never tried a criminal case. Halligan couldn’t even find the courtroom, and no prosecutor in the office agreed to accompany her, as is customary. Doesn’t matter. She had one job.</p><p>"My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump," Comey said in a video.</p><p>Fourteen of the 23 grand jurors backed the two charges, just over the required minimum, and the jurors dismissed a proposed third count.</p><p>National Review’s Andy McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor, called the indictment "so ill-conceived and incompetently drafted, he should be able to get it thrown out on a pretrial motion to dismiss."</p><p>Dan Abrams, ABC’s chief legal analyst (and founder of Mediaite) said on "This Week": "I don’t even think that many in the Trump administration believe they’re going to get a conviction. I think that there’s a 95 percent-plus chance that there won’t be a conviction. That it’ll either get dismissed by a judge, there’ll be a hung jury, there’ll be an acquittal. But I’m not certain that that’s the end goal here." </p><p>In other words, making Comey’s life miserable and forcing him to pay legal fees may be satisfying enough.</p><p>Schiff, for his part, called the mortgage fraud allegation against him "the kind of stuff you see tinpot dictators do." .</p><p>But there’s a larger issue here than the culpability of Comey and the others. As a former Justice Department reporter, I know all too well that presidents are not supposed to intervene in criminal investigations, and that dates to a series of post-Watergate reforms after Richard Nixon’s attorney general went to prison.</p><p>But Trump does all this out in the open. There’s no need to rely on unnamed sources. When he issued a memo demanding investigations of his foes, he made it public. </p><p>"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility," the president wrote on Truth Social. He complained that "nothing is being done," demanding that Bondi investigate Coney, James and Schiff. And now he’s talking about targeting Democratic donor and activist George Soros.</p><p>The president also has a knack for letting his allies off the hook. After New York Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on corruption charges, Trump ordered the case dropped. Then he tried to lure Adams out of the race by offering him a job, to boost the chances of defeating the man he calls "Communist" Zohran Mamdani. Adams, stuck in single digits, just dropped out, and don’t be surprised if he winds up as an ambassador.</p><p>When a deranged shooter in Michigan opened fire during a Mormon church service, and set the place on fire, killing at least four people, before being shot to death, Trump called it "horrendous" and called Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the killer hated Mormons.</p><p>The president called it "another targeted attack on Christians."</p><p>What Trump and Leavitt neglected to mention is that the murderer has a Trump/Vance sign in front of his house.</p><p>So despite the president’s insistence that left-wingers are responsible for virtually all political violence, here’s a case where a right-winger, and Trump fan, is responsible for cold-blooded mass murder. But one day there will a Democrat in the White House again, ready to use the same tactics unleashed by Trump.</p><p>Dartmouth professor Brendan Nyhan, who heads a watchdog group, told the New York Times: "Do Republicans want to give President AOC unilateral powers to determine which Defense Department programs she wants to fund?"</p><p>His forthcoming report says "50 percent of Democrats now support restricting or shutting down Fox News, up from 37 percent in 2021." I would find that chilling, even if I didn’t work at Fox. Where is it written that the government should be shutting down news outlets?</p><p>The larger point is this: Trump believes he’s entitled to payback because of all the indictments aimed at him. The Democrats believe Trump has shattered the wall that protected criminal probes from White House interference. And so we plunge into an endless cycle of retribution, with each administration investigating the previous one and justifying it as getting even for their own mistreatment. </p><p>: <i>The news conference that President Trump was going to hold with </i><i>Bibi Netanyahu</i><i> yesterday turned into a non-conference when Trump, of all people, refused to take questions — not even the traditional two from each side. So they each gave lengthy speeches and left.</i></p><p><i>But the president achieved something remarkable. He got Bibi to go along with his plan to end the </i><i>war in Gaza</i><i>. Trump even said he’d personally head a peace board designed to protect Israel’s security, that Hamas would release the remaining hostages, and mentioned Oct. 7.</i></p><p><i>Honestly, it was probably shrewd not to be distracted by questions.</i></p><p><i>Here’s the problem: </i><i>Hamas</i><i> hasn’t agreed to anything yet, and has stuck by its insistence on a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces before any hostages are released. So the terrorist group is unlikely to agree.</i></p><p><i>If Hamas rejects the plan, Netanyahu said, "Israel will finish the job by itself."</i></p><p><i>Then he said, "we can do this the easy way or the hard way" — apparently unaware that was the much-condemned line that FCC Chairman Brendan Carr used to threaten action against </i><i>Jimmy Kimme</i><i>l.</i></p><p><i>Bibi also demanded an end to "incitement by the media," as if he or anyone else could tell the press what to do.      </i></p></body></div></body></html>

Witt, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, and the Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, as defendants. </p><p>The complaint argues that not only are sanctuary policies illegal under federal law, but lead to the release of dangerous criminals who would otherwise be subject to removal, including illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes. </p><p>"Minnesota officials are jeopardizing the safety of their own citizens by allowing illegal aliens to circumvent the legal process," Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. "This Department of Justice will continue to bring litigation against any jurisdiction that uses sanctuary policies to defy federal law and undermine law enforcement."</p><p>Saint Paul characterized the lawsuit as an effective attack on the city’s "long-standing separation ordinance – an essential policy that promotes public safety, builds community trust, and reflects Saint Paul’s commitment to serving and protecting all residents regardless of immigration status." </p><p>"City employees don’t work for the president, we work for the people who live here.

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Denver Broncos got back in the win column, handling the Cincinnati Bengals, 28-3, at home on Monday night.</p><p>The Broncos and Bengals are now 2-2 through the first four weeks of the season, though the latter isn’t looking too hot after yet another brutal offensive performance with backup quarterback Jake Browning at the helm for the injured Joe Burrow. </p><p>Browning was just 14-of-25 for 125 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions in a performance that came after just 10 points scored in a loss to the Minnesota Vikings this past week – his first filling the starting role for Burrow. </p><p>Credit has to go to the Broncos’ defense, though, as they were able to sack Browning three times and force nine straight third-down stops against the Bengals to end the season. Cincinnati was just 2-of-11 on third down, with the only two successful ones coming on the opening drive.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bo Nix and the Broncos’ offense looked good at home on Monday night, as Nix went 29-of-42 for 326 yards with two touchdown passes and one interception.</p><p>The Bengals got on the board first with an opening-drive field goal, but it was the Broncos who found the end zone first thanks to Nix taking it himself from six yards out on third-and-5 for a rushing score just before the end of the first quarter. </p><p>Nix clearly found the rhythm as the Broncos would follow up that first touchdown with another, this time allowing Marvin Mims’ speed to show out with a 16-yard rush on a jet sweep. Courtland Sutton also added a key 22-yard reception on third-and-4 to keep that drive alive before Mims’ stellar run. </p><p>Sutton would find the end zone himself as well, with Nix firing a dart from 20 yards away for the touchdown with eight seconds left to play in the first half. </p><p>A 21-3 lead for the Broncos at halftime could’ve been worse if Nix wasn’t intercepted on fourth-and-1 from the Cincinnati two-yard line with two minutes remaining in the second quarter. But it was a turnover that ultimately didn’t hurt the Broncos due to the Bengals’ ineptitude on offense. </p><p>Star wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase was even seen going up to head coach Zac Taylor during the second half clearly frustrated as the offense couldn’t put anything together. </p><p>Denver ended up capping their victory with an easy touchdown for rookie running back R.J. Harvey on a lofted 12-yard connection to make it 28-3. </p><p>While Harvey scored, it was veteran running back J.K.

<div class="article-title">Darren Waller puts on vintage performance to help Dolphins grab first win of 2025 season</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Darren Waller turned back the clock on Monday night to help the Miami Dolphins vanquish the New York Jets, 27-21.</p><p>The one-time Pro Bowl tight end appeared in his first game for the Dolphins in the 2025 season after taking a year off from football following a stint with the New York Giants. He looked like his old self as he was able to carve up the Jets’ defense multiple times.</p><p>Waller caught two touchdown passes in a single game for the first time since he was with the Las Vegas Raiders in December 2020. He had his first touchdown catch since October 2023 when he was still with the Giants.</p><p>The first touchdown catch came in the second quarter. Tua Tagovailoa found a way to get the Dolphins into the red zone thanks to a creative flip to Malik Washington and easy throws to Tyreek Hill.</p><p>The second touchdown capped off a six-play, 36-yard drive in the third quarter. Tagovailoa found Waller for a 9-yard touchdown catch.</p><p>It had taken a bit for Waller to get back into game shape as he had been out of the league for more than a year. But, at least on Monday, the chance the Dolphins took on Waller paid off.</p><p>It wasn’t all smiles for the Dolphins.</p><p>Miami took a hit in the third quarter when Hill suffered a gruesome knee injury. Multiple reports indicated that the team feared he had dislocated his knee. If confirmed, it’s likely that he would be out for the remainder of the season.</p><p>Tagovailoa was 17-of-25 with 177 yards with the two touchdown passes. Running back De’Von Achane ran for 99 yards and a score.</p><p>Hill had six catches for 67 yards before he exited the game. Waller had three catches for 27 yards.</p><p>The Jets tried to get back into the game.</p><p>Justin Fields needed a miracle on 4th-and-1 in the third quarter. He was being chased around by the Dolphins defense and was able to avoid would-be tacklers to find a hole and burst through it. He scampered for a 43-yard touchdown to put some pressure on Miami.</p><p>The Jets nearly had a touchdown on a pass from Fields to Garrett Wilson. However, Wilson was called for offensive pass interference and it negated the score. New York had to settle for the field goal.</p><p>Wilson made up for it later in the night with an incredible catch and narrowly keeping himself in bounds.</p><p>But it was frustrating scenes for the Jets for the entire night.</p><p>New York committed 13 penalties for 101 yards along with three turnovers. Those penalties ultimately destroyed any momentum the offense would build up.</p><p>Fields was 20-of-27 with 227 passing yards and the touchdown pass to Wilson. He also led the team with 81 rushing yards.</p><p>Wilson finished with six catches for 82 yards.</p><p>The Jets have now lost 10 straight to the Dolphins in Miami.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A comet traveling outside the solar system and heading toward the Earth is much larger than scientists first believed, a scientist has detailed in a new report.</p><p>Avi Loeb claims the comet could even be an artifact of alien technology rather than a natural body because it weighs more than 33 billion tons and spans at least 3.1 miles across.</p><p>The object, named 3I/ATLAS, is only the third interstellar visitor ever detected, after Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. </p><p>The astrophysicist also revealed in a Medium blog post that new data and measurements indicate the comet’s nucleus is more massive than first estimated.</p><p>3I/ATLAS was spotted in July with observations showing the comet is shedding huge amounts of carbon dioxide and dust as it races toward the Sun. </p><p>Loeb and his colleagues calculated a slight "non-gravitational acceleration" in its movement caused by "outgassing" which suggests the object must be far heavier than early models assumed.</p><p>The comet dwarfs Oumuamua, just a quarter-mile long, and Borisov, about 0.6 miles across. </p><p>"This makes 3I/ATLAS three to five orders of magnitude more massive than the previous two interstellar objects we’ve observed," Loeb wrote in his post.</p><p>Next week the comet will pass within 1.67 million miles of Mars’ orbit while also coming close to both Jupiter and Venus. </p><p>Loeb has urged NASA to turn the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter towards the object and said that even a single bright pixel could fine tune estimates of its true dimensions.</p><p>"We should not decide about the nature of 3I/ATLAS based on the chemical composition of its skin," Loeb wrote. </p><p>"For the same reason, we should not judge a book by its cover," he added.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Miami Dolphins star wide receiver Tyreek Hill was taken to a local hospital after suffering a gruesome knee injury on Monday night against the New York Jets. </p><p>Hill needed to be carted off the field in the third quarter after his left leg buckled in awkward fashion as he was making a catch near the sideline. The ESPN broadcast showed a replay of the action. Hill’s leg was bent in a direction it shouldn’t have been, to put it simply. </p><p>Both medical staffs for the Jets and Dolphins made their way quickly to Hill, who was put into an air cast and placed on the back of a cart. He was seen smiling almost out of disbelief as the Dolphins crowd at Hard Rock Stadium cheered for their speedy wide receiver, who acknowledged them as the cart drove to the tunnel. </p><p>Hill was quickly ruled out of the game with what the Dolphins called a knee injury. Head coach Mike McDaniel confirmed after the Dolphins 27-21 win that Hill dislocated his knee. </p><p>He will remain in the hospital overnight, though he said Hill had an upbeat attitude despite what the future for this season at least holds. </p><p>A dislocated knee usually means that other ligaments were torn in the process, which would effectively end Hill’s season. The Dolphins will await a definitive diagnosis there, but it’s likely Hill’s cleat won’t be on anytime soon. </p><p>"He is being taken to a local hospital for imaging, evaluation and observation," the Dolphins’ statement on X read. </p><p>Hill and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa were on the same page in this game, as No. 10 caught six passes for 67 yards to lead the Dolphins in that category before his injury. </p><p>Considering the seriousness of the injury, Hill’s 2025 season could be over. He has just 15 catches for 198 yards with one touchdown over four games this year. </p><p>The Dolphins came into this game against their AFC East foe struggling with an 0-3 record, as Mike McDaniel’s offense hadn’t been its usual electric self. </p><p>Hill had a slow start to the 2025 campaign, catching just four passes for 40 yards in a blowout loss to the Indianapolis Colts. He looked like his normal self, though, when he had 109 yards on six grabs in Week 2 against the New England Patriots. </p><p>Hill scored his first touchdown of the season last week on "Thursday Night Football" against the Buffalo Bills, where he had five catches for 49 yards.  </p><p>Hill is in his 10th NFL season, his fourth with the Dolphins after six with the Kansas City Chiefs.</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Local California women’s rights activist Beth Bourne protested the policy allowing transgender students access to girls’ locker rooms by stripping down to a bikini at a local school board meeting.</p><p>Bourne, who chairs the Moms for Liberty in Yolo County, took part in the Davis Joint Unified School Board meeting on Sept. 18 where she highlighted school policies on locker room access.</p><p>"I’m a parent in the Davis Unified School District, and I’m here today to talk about the policies you have for the locker rooms in the junior high schools.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>FIRST ON FOX: An illegal alien who left an obscenity-laden bomb threat to a member of Congress was arrested by ICE over the weekend, according to the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, the DHS said that Rigoberto Albizar-Martinez, a 58-year-old Cuban illegal living in Tampa, was arrested by ICE over the weekend as part of its efforts to crack down on the "worst of the worst" criminal illegal aliens.</p><p>DHS said that Albizar-Martinez threatened to bomb the office of Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla.</p><p>He was sentenced to a year in prison in May after being found guilty in December of leaving a "vulgar, racist, obscenity-laden voicemail" in which he threatened to plant a bomb in the congresswoman’s Tampa office, according to a statement by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida.</p><p>Local outlet WFLA reported that in his message, Albizar-Martinez said in Spanish, "I’m going to plant a bomb in your office. It’s a threat," and "It’s a threat, so take it however you want you son of a f****** b****."</p><p>The outlet also reported that in the same message, Albizar-Martinez also attacked Democrats, black people and pro-Palestinian people.</p><p>Commenting on his arrest by ICE, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Fox News Digital that "there is no place for political violence in America."</p><p>"Rigoberto Albizar-Martinez threatened to bomb a Congresswoman’s office," said McLaughlin. "Thanks to the brave men and women of ICE, this illegal alien and national security threat will be out of our country.</p><p>"Nothing will deter us to remove the worst of the worst from America communities," she added.</p><p>Castor did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.</p><p>This comes as many Democrats have criticized ICE agents for carrying out immigration enforcement operations, accusing them of racially profiling people, using "Gestapo tactics" and terrorizing communities.</p><p>DHS said that over the weekend, it also arrested several other criminal illegal aliens, including child rapists, gang members and a human smuggler.</p><p>Among those arrested was Jorge German Aglony, a Chilean illegal in California, who was convicted of inflicting pain and suffering on a dependent adult or elder, as well as receipt and possession of child pornography.</p><p>Another illegal arrested, Leonardo Velazquez-Marin, from Mexico, was also convicted of possession of child pornography in Dallas County, Texas. Also in Texas, ICE arrested Jose Elias Mejia-Orellana, a Honduran national who was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child under 14 in Collin County.</p><p>In Maryland, ICE arrested another child predator, Melvin Guiakora, from Central African Republic, who was convicted for sexual solicitation of a minor in Washington County.</p><p>ICE also arrested a member of the Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion, Mexican national Adan Mares-Martinez, who was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon causing great bodily injury in Norwalk, California. </p><p>Another illegal, Elvin Humberto Madrigal-Calero, from Nicaragua, was arrested following a conviction of involuntary manslaughter in Pulaski County, Virginia. </p><p>In El Centro, California, Mexican national Oscar Morales-Valencia, was arrested by ICE following a conviction of bringing in and harboring aliens.</p><p>This comes shortly after DHS announced that two million illegal immigrants "have been removed or have self-deported" from the U.S. since Jan. 20, putting the Trump administration on pace to break records.</p><p>In less than 250 days, an estimated 1.6 million illegal immigrants have voluntarily self-deported, while 400,000 were removed by federal law enforcement, the DHS said last week, describing the situation as a "new milestone."</p><p>"Ramped-up immigration enforcement targeting the worst of the worst is removing more and more criminal illegal aliens off our streets every day and is sending a clear message to anyone else in this country illegally: Self-deport or we will arrest and deport you," said McLaughlin.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>An emotional speech from a grieving father led LIV Golf star Phil Mickelson to call out the justice system.</p><p>Mickelson saw the testimony by Stephen Federico at a House Judiciary Subcommittee meeting Monday in Charlotte, North Carolina, following the stabbing death of Iryna Zarutska on the city’s light rail less than two months ago.</p><p>Federico’s daughter, Logan, a 22-year-old aspiring teacher from Waxhaw, North Carolina, was visiting friends at the University of South Carolina when "career criminal" Alexander Dickey allegedly broke into a Cypress Street home on May 3 and shot and killed her.</p><p>Dickey had been arrested 39 times on 25 felonies. Federico shared his grief and explained why he continues to push for change in the legal system.</p><p>Mickelson was clearly moved, reposting Federico’s remarks on X with his own message.</p><p>"The judge(s) who let this person go should be held accountable and in jail," Mickelson wrote.</p><p>Federico’s testimony was raw and emotional.</p><p>"Think about your child coming home from a night out with their friends, laying down going to sleep, feeling somebody come into their room and wake them. Drag them out of bed, naked, force on her knees with her hands over her head, begging for her life," he said, fighting back tears.</p><p>"She was 5-foot-3, she weighed 115 pounds. Bang! Dead. Gone. Why? Because Alexander Devante Dickey, who was arrested 39 goddamn times, 25 felonies, was on the street. … You will be sick and tired of my face and my voice until this gets fixed. I will fight until my last breath for my daughter. Stop protecting the people that keep taking them from us … please. You have the power. We put you into power to do what you have to do. We’re asking you, we’re begging you all to stop this."</p><p>Federico later appeared on Fox News’ "The Ingraham Angle," where he explained his mission further.</p><p>"I’m fighting for Logan. I have to be Logan’s voice because nobody else will be. I don’t have anybody fighting for her justice. Somebody has to fight for the innocent people who are left here. We have to make some drastic changes in our system. People like Alexander Dickey should not be on the street — people know that," he said.</p><p>The Lexington County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that Dickey’s criminal record spanned eight agencies. He was booked 11 times between 2013 and 2025, facing multiple burglary and larceny charges. A first-degree burglary conviction in South Carolina carries a minimum 15-year prison sentence and up to life in prison.</p><p>Federico said the system gave Dickey more rights than his daughter ever had.</p><p>"They cared more about making sure he wasn’t put in prison than worrying about whether or not he was going to hurt somebody," he said. "His crimes escalated every time he made a new one. He finally graduated to the jackpot and executed our daughter. We’re still trying to hear from our South Carolina solicitor to see if he’s going to get the death penalty or not. Obviously, it checks all the boxes that it does.</p><p>"But they’re more concerned about keeping criminals out of the prisons and institutions than they are to try to rehabilitate them. You can’t rehabilitate some of these guys, it’s just impossible."</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said it was a "tragedy" that conservative activist Charlie Kirk was killed "in that way," and said there is no legacy to honor. </p><p>Omar spoke to former CNN anchor Don Lemon in which he asked her about criticism of her previous comments about Kirk and if she would apologize.</p><p>"Well, I have nothing to apologize for," Omar said. "You know, it is a tragedy that Charlie Kirk was killed in that way. I feel for his widow and his children. They will have to live with that for the rest of their lives."</p><p>She went on to condemn Kirk, arguing, "But there is no legacy to honor. It was a legacy filled with bigotry, hatred, and White supremacy. And as a Black woman and as a Muslim in this country, I refuse to join the chorus that changes the history of what is on the record from this man."</p><p>She argued that Kirk’s defenders can "do whatever they want to do, but I am not going to be bullied into complacency, into dishonoring who I am and what I stand for just to make them feel comfortable."</p><p>When asked for comment about her saying it was a "tragedy that Charlie Kirk was killed in that way," a spokesperson for Omar told Fox News Digital that the congresswoman has "clearly condemned" Kirk's murder and expressed condolences several times. </p><p>The spokesperson also accused right-wing outlets of making "disingenuous attempts" to twist the Squad member's words and put her life in danger. </p><p>Earlier in the interview, Omar argued that conservatives are eager to blame political violence on the left so they can use it as an excuse to crack down on them. </p><p>"I think to them it is easy to blame someone else. It is hard for them to face the fact that there is something wrong, and that they have to address it," she said. "If it is someone like you and I, then they could just be like, ‘Hey Black people, fix your problem.’ They never think about like, ‘Okay, there is a problem in this country where we have young White men who are picking up a gun, mass executing people, and we should talk about that.’ And that's not a conversation that they're interested in having because they rather focus on you and I."</p><p>Omar had previously been criticized for her condemnation of Kirk on a podcast to the extent she was hit with a House Ethics Committee complaint. </p><p>Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., forced a vote on censuring Omar over her reaction to Kirk's killing, but the move was quashed when four Republicans and all Democrats voted to table the measure.</p><p>Omar specifically faced backlash over an interview with progressive news outlet Zeteo, in which she criticized Kirk's past commentary and Republicans' reaction to the shooting. She later accused Republicans of taking her words out of context, and she called Kirk's death "mortifying."</p><p><i>Fox News' Elizabeth Elkind contributed to this article.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> A Florida-based multi-agency task force has seized a record one million pounds of cocaine during fiscal year 2025 — a haul officials say represents 378 million lethal doses, enough to kill every American.</p><p>The seizure was announced by Joint Inter-Agency Task Force – South (JIATF-S), led by U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). The unit, which includes the U.S. Coast Guard, works with partner nations to disrupt the flow of illicit drugs through the "transit zone" between South America, Central America and the Caribbean and to weaken transnational criminal organizations.</p><p>According to the task force, the amount of drugs seized over the past 12 months is enough to fill 42 dump trucks. The 2025 fiscal year ends Tuesday. </p><p>JIATF-S confirmed to Fox News Digital that the effort has denied cartels and narco-terrorists $11.34 billion in revenue and removed 377.9 million lethal doses from the streets.</p><p>JIATF-S operates across 42 million square miles, from the Eastern Pacific to the Western Atlantic, stretching from international waters north of the Caribbean Antilles to the southern tip of South America at Cape Horn.</p><p>The region has long been a major trafficking corridor for drugs, arms, cash and people. Well-financed and sophisticated criminal networks continue to exploit the area, officials said.</p><p>"By disrupting the flow of these deadly drugs, JIATF-S is saving lives and protecting our homeland," the agency added.</p><p>A seizure of this magnitude has never been accomplished before. Officials said the one million pounds of cocaine does not include the strikes on Venezuelan narco-terrorists.</p><p>The Trump administration has vowed to intensify military action in the Caribbean as part of its counter-narcotics strategy.</p><p>In recent months, U.S. forces have conducted multiple operations targeting smuggling vessels as President Donald Trump pushed to crack down on cartels and stem the flow of cocaine and other illicit drugs into the United States.</p><p>In February, Trump designated groups, including Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel as foreign terrorist organizations. The Justice Department has also offered a $50 million reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.</p><p>Maduro is accused by U.S. authorities of helping lead the Cartel of the Suns, a Venezuelan drug-trafficking network allegedly comprised of senior government and military officials.</p><p>"As he gained power in Venezuela, Maduro participated in a corrupt and violent narco-terrorism conspiracy with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization," a State Department bulletin states. </p><p>Prosecutors allege Maduro helped arrange multi-ton shipments of FARC-produced cocaine and directed the Cartel of the Suns to provide the group with military-grade weapons.</p><p>In August, Trump approved the deployment of several U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyers to strengthen counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean.</p><p>Maduro responded by declaring that Venezuela was ready to resist any attacks, calling the move "an extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat."

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Jury selection has begun in the high-profile murder trial of Sarah Hartsfield, the Texas woman accused of killing her fifth husband with insulin. </p><p>The proceedings mark the latest chapter in a case that has gripped Texas as the 50-year-old faces accusations that she murdered her husband, Joseph Hartsfield, in January 2023. Hartsfield pleaded not guilty.</p><p>According to a grand jury indictment, filed in February 2023, prosecutors allege she "intentionally and knowingly cause[d] the death of an individual, namely Joseph Hartsfield, by a manner and means unknown to the grand jury." </p><p>Joseph's obituary says he died in a hospital "due to complications of an ischemic stroke, with his loving wife at his side." Hartsfield is currently in custody at the Chambers County Jail in Texas and is held on a reduced bond of $2 million. </p><p>Prosecutors allege that Hartsfield, an Army veteran, used her husband’s diabetes to cover up a homicide, allegedly injecting him with dangerous amounts of insulin and delaying calling 911 for several hours. </p><p>Joseph was taken to a hospital and died days later. Investigators later uncovered multiple insulin pens near his bedside and questioned inconsistencies in Hartsfield’s statements.</p><p>"I appreciate the hard work of the deputies and detectives who followed their instincts and identified the suspicious circumstances surrounding Mr. Hartsfield’s death that could have been labeled as ‘death due to illness’ instead of murder," Sheriff Brian Hawthorne said at the time of her arrest.</p><p>The defense has argued that Joseph’s death may have been a tragic complication of his own medical condition rather than a deliberate act by his wife. Part of what makes the case complex is Hartsfield’s marital history. The now 48-year-old has been married five times. </p><p>Hartsfield’s first marriage was to her high school sweetheart, Titus Knoernschild. The couple married young, but the relationship soon soured. Knoernschild told ABC13 Houston that Sarah threatened him during their separation, warning him not to be surprised if he didn’t survive their divorce. According to the local outlet, they divorced by 1995, but he said she continued to harass him for years afterward, including showing up at his Fort Hood office in 2008 until he obtained a no-contact order.</p><p>She went on to marry her second husband in the mid-1990s. According to ABC13, Sarah was arrested in March 1996 for allegedly assaulting him during a dispute at their Rio Bonito home. The charge was dropped after about a week, ABC13 reported.</p><p>By the late 1990s, Sarah had remarried, and her third marriage eventually ended in divorce in 2018. Around that time, she became engaged to David Bragg in Minnesota. On May 9, 2018, Sarah shot and killed Bragg in his home. She told investigators that he fired at her first and that she returned fire. Douglas County prosecutors ruled the killing a justifiable act of self-defense at the time, according to FOX9 Minneapolis. </p><p>Not long after Bragg’s death, Sarah married her fourth husband around 2019. That marriage also ended in divorce by 2021.</p><p>Sarah’s fifth marriage was to Joseph Hartsfield, whom she wed in 2022. Friends and neighbors told Click2Houston that Joseph was unhappy in the marriage and had been planning to leave. On Jan. 7, 2023, Joseph was found unresponsive after a diabetic emergency.</p><p>Prosecutors allege Sarah injected him with excessive insulin and delayed calling 911. He died days later. The Harris County Medical Examiner ruled the cause of death as complications from toxic insulin exposure.</p><p>In February 2023, Sarah was arrested and indicted for Joseph’s murder. </p><p>Her trial is scheduled to begin on Tuesday with opening statements after jury selection.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>After an illegal alien, Ian Andre Roberts, the superintendent of the Des Moines Public Schools in Iowa, was arrested by ICE, Republicans blew the whistle on the fact that he was a registered active Democrat voter in the state of Maryland.</p><p>According to the official website for the Maryland State Board of Elections, Roberts, who overstayed a student visa from 1999, has an active voter status and is registered as a Democrat in Maryland. The development was first reported on by columnist Dustin Grage.</p><p>Republican state Delegate Matt Morgan, who is chair of the Maryland House Freedom Caucus, told Fox News Digital that Roberts’ registration means that he is eligible to vote in all federal, state and local elections despite not being a U.S. citizen, and also despite likely not having lived in Maryland for the past decade.</p><p>Morgan explained that there is nothing in Maryland law allowing for non-citizens to be registered to vote in federal or state elections even if Roberts were still a legal resident.</p><p>Now, the House Freedom Caucus is demanding answers from the Maryland State Board of Elections about "gaping holes" in the state’s election integrity systems.</p><p>In a letter sent to the elections board on Monday, the Freedom Caucus also demanded answers on why the board has been "obstructing a valid request by the Department of Justice to ensure compliance with federal election laws, citing immigration enforcement as a primary concern.</p><p>Morgan pointed to a letter the elections board sent to the Justice Department in August in which State Administrator of Elections Jared DeMarinis expressed concern that if the board gave over voter information to the federal government that data would be used for "used for enforcement of immigration laws against Maryland residents."  </p><p>Commenting on the letter, Morgan asked, "If illegal aliens are not allowed to vote, why would they be on the voter rolls in the first place? And how would that enhance immigration enforcement? I don't know, but that's the excuse that they wrote to the DOJ."</p><p>"It's ridiculous," he went on, adding that "everyone reasonable wants a safe and secure election."</p><p>Before his arrest by ICE, Roberts headed the Des Moines Public Schools, the largest school district in the state, despite not being legally authorized to work in the U.S. after his employment authorization card expired in 2020, according to authorities.</p><p>He was taken into custody on a fugitive warrant last week. ICE agents arrested Roberts after he attempted to flee and was found hiding in brush. The vehicle Roberts was driving was found with $3,000 in cash, a fixed-blade hunting knife, and a loaded Glock 19 firearm, ICE said.</p><p>Roberts also had illegal weapons possession charges from 2020 and was given a final order of removal in 2024.</p><p>The state of Iowa revoked Roberts' education license on Sunday, triggering the Des Moines School Board to place him on unpaid leave.</p><p>"We were notified that the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked Doctor Roberts' license to practice as a superintendent in the state of Iowa. Without such a license, Doctor Roberts is not in compliance with his contract," said Jackie Norris, chair of the school board.</p><p>Morgan said that though Roberts’ case is baffling, he fears he may just be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to illegal aliens registered to vote in Maryland.</p><p>"We have no idea how widespread this is. We hear rumors, but we have no idea," he said.</p><p>"This is uncharted territory," he added.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A blogger has blasted British police after they arrested him for sharing a meme on social media that read "F--- Hamas."</p><p>Pete North, 47, filmed officers arriving at his Yorkshire home in the U.K. on Sept. 25 and telling him he was being detained because he had "posted something on the internet" that a member of their hate crime team "didn’t appreciate." </p><p>The shocking footage shows an officer explaining that North was being arrested "on suspicion of publishing or distributing written material intended to stir up racial hatred."</p><p>The post in question had been shared by North on X in August and featured a Palestinian flag with the words: "F--- Palestine. F--- Hamas. F--- Islam. Want to protest? F--- off to Muslim country and protest."</p><p>North confirmed to The Telegraph that although the meme contained offensive references to Palestine and Islam, officers in the interview at the station appeared preoccupied with the part directed at Hamas.</p><p>"The officer in the interview said, ‘Well, firstly, let’s start with the meme. You posted a meme that said f--- Hamas,’" North recalled to the British outlet.</p><p>"I said, ‘yeah, I did post a meme that said f--- Hamas, because Hamas are a proscribed terrorist organisation internationally, including in Britain'."</p><p>He added: "I then asked him, ‘Just so we’re on the same page, you do know who Hamas are?’ And he just… shook his head.

<div class="article-title">Louisiana seeks arrest of California doctor accused of mailing abortion pills</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Baton Rouge, La</em>. — Louisiana is pursuing a criminal case against another out-of-state doctor accused of mailing abortion pills to a patient in the state, court documents filed this month revealed.</p><p>A warrant for the arrest of a California doctor is a rare charge of violating one of the state abortion bans that has taken effect since the U.S. <span class="link">Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade</span> in 2022 and allowed enforcement. </p><p>It represents an additional front in a growing legal battle between liberal and conservative states over prescribing abortion medications via telehealth and mailing them to patients. </p><p><span class="link">Pills are the most common way abortions are accessed in the U.S.</span> and are a major reason that, despite the bans, abortion numbers rose last year, according to a report. </p><p>Louisiana said in a court case filed Sept. 19 that it had issued a warrant for a California-based doctor who it says provided pills to a Louisiana woman in 2023. </p>
<p>Both the woman, Rosalie Markezich, and the state's attorney general are seeking to be part of a lawsuit that seeks to order drug regulators to bar telehealth prescriptions to mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions. </p><p>In court filings, Markezich says her boyfriend at the time used her email address to order drugs from Dr. Remy Coeytaux, a California physician, and sent her $150, which she forwarded to Coeytaux. She said she had no other contact with the doctor. </p><p>She said she did not want to take the pills but felt forced to and said in the filing that "the trauma of my chemical abortion still haunts me" and that it would not have happened if telehealth prescriptions to the drug were off limits. </p><p>The accusation builds on a position taken by anti-abortion groups: that allowing abortion pills to be prescribed by phone or video call and filled by mail opens the door to women being coerced into taking them. </p>
<p>"Rosalie is bravely representing many woman who are victimized by the illegal, immoral, and unethical conduct of these drug dealers," Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement. </p><p>Murrill's office didn't immediately answer questions about what charges Coeytaux faces or when the warrant was issued. But under the state's ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, physicians convicted of providing abortions face up to 15 years in prison and $200,000 in fines. </p><p>Coeytaux is also the target of a lawsuit filed in July in federal court by a Texas man who says the doctor illegally provided his girlfriend with abortion pills. </p><p>Email and a telephone message seeking comment were left for Coeytaux. </p><p>The combination of a Louisiana criminal case and a Texas civil case over abortion pills is also playing out surrounding a New York doctor, Margaret Carpenter. New York authorities are refusing to extradite Carpenter to Louisiana or to enforce Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton the $100,000 civil judgment against her. </p><p>In the Louisiana case, officials said a pregnant minor's mother requested the abortion medication online and directed her daughter to take them. The mother was arrested, pleaded not guilty and was released on bond. </p><p>New York officials cite a law there that seeks to protect medical providers who prescribe abortion medications to patients in states with abortion bans - or where such prescriptions by telehealth violate the law. </p>
<p>New York and California are among the eight states that have shield laws with such provisions, according to a tally by the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. </p><p>The Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine said they "fully expect" California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, to uphold his state's shield law in the new case.  </p><p>Murrill told The Associated Press she will sue governors whose shield laws "purport to protect these individuals from criminal conduct" in Louisiana.  </p><p>The legal filings that revealed the Louisiana charge against Coeytaux are part of an effort for Louisiana, along with Florida and Texas, to join a lawsuit filed last year by the Republican attorneys general for Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to roll back federal approvals for mifepristone. </p><p>This year, both Louisiana and <span class="link">Texas have adopted laws</span> to target out-of-state providers of abortion pills. </p><p>The Louisiana law lets patients who receive abortions sue providers and others. The Texas law goes further and allows anyone to sue those who prescribe such pills in the state. </p><p>Both Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary have said they are <span class="link">conducting a full review of mifepristone's safety and effectiveness</span>.</p>
<p>Asked whether the review could lead to a ban on mifepristone, CBS News medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder suggested it would be difficult for the FDA to withdraw approval, an extraordinary step that would quickly draw legal challenges. But she said depending on what the safety review finds, it could make access more difficult by limiting the drug's availability through telehealth or by mail or by restricting the ability to prescribe it to doctors, rather than physician assistants or nurses who are also currently permitted to prescribe it.</p><p>Medication abortion has been available in the U.S. since 2000, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of mifepristone. </p><p>A group of 19 Democratic state attorneys general on Monday issued a statement saying that mifepristone is safe and expressing concern over an FDA review, which some Republican attorneys general had called for.  </p><p>The Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine reiterated in a statement to The Associated Press that the medication is safe and an "essential part of women's healthcare." </p><p>The nationwide organization, co-founded by Carpenter, described Louisiana's legal actions against Coeytaux as "extreme" and said it is an attempt to "intimidate healthcare providers." </p><p>Murrill described the "unlawful distribution" of the pills in Louisiana as "dangerous," adding that she will use "any legal means available" to hold accountable those who violate the state's abortion laws.</p>

<div class="article-title">Prosecutors want Sean "Diddy" Combs to get more than 11 years in prison</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>New York — </em>Prosecutors urged a New York federal judge Tuesday to send Sean "Diddy" Combs to prison for over 11 years following <span class="link">his conviction on prostitution-related charges</span>, citing one of his accusers who said she lives in fear of the music mogul's release from detention.</p><p>"His crimes of conviction are serious and have warranted sentences over ten years in multiple cases for defendants who, like Sean Combs, engaged in violence and put others in fear," they wrote in a presentence submission requesting at least 11 years and three months in prison. </p><p>They filed their sentencing recommendation shortly after midnight, including letters from some of his accusers describing how his violence and demands had impacted their lives. </p><p>Prosecutors called Combs "unrepentant" and said Combs had conceded his acts of violence and abuse throughout his trial but "incredibly ... he now argues that his victims should shoulder the blame."</p><p>Combs, 55, has remained jailed since his July conviction on charges related to arranging male sex workers to travel to hotels or residences where he directed them to have sex with his girlfriends. </p>
<p>The elaborate dayslong, drug-fueled sexual events were often filmed by Combs. Defense attorneys have <span class="link">asked that he be sentenced to no more than 14 months</span> in prison. Sentencing is <span class="link">set for Friday</span>. The music mogul had pleaded not guilty to all of the charges brought against him.  </p><p>In July, Combs was convicted of two charges for violating the Mann Act, which outlaws interstate commerce related to prostitution, for arranging the paid sexual encounters between his girlfriends and male sex workers. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. </p><p>The same jury acquitted the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that could have resulted in a life sentence. </p><p><span class="link">Last week</span>, the defense submitted its presentence arguments, saying Combs has suffered enough during his nearly 13 months behind bars and that he should be freed soon.</p>
<p>They wrote that he became a changed man in a Brooklyn federal lockup, where he has been under constant suicide watch and learned to react calmly rather than violently to threats, even when a fellow inmate confronted him with a shiv. </p>
<p>They said Combs has realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in. </p><p>Prosecutors said Combs was now trying to cast himself as a victim. </p><p>"He is not the victim," they wrote. "The Court should focus on the very real effects that the defendant's conduct had on the lives of the actual victims, his victims." </p><p>At trial, two of Combs' former girlfriends testified that they felt forced to participate in the drug-fueled sex marathons with male sex workers as Combs watched and sometimes filmed.</p><h2>Ex-girlfriends tell court about treatment by Coombs</h2><p>R&amp;B singer Casandra "Cassie" Ventura<span class="link"> described being beaten by Combs</span> when she displeased him during their decadelong relationship. Another ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym "Jane," said she felt pressured to perform sexually with male sex workers. She testified that an enraged Combs once put her in a chokehold and punched her in the face. </p><p>In a letter accompanying the prosecutors' submission, Cassie wrote that she testified while nine months pregnant during Combs' trial "in front of a packed courtroom about the most traumatic and horrifying chapter in my life. I testified that from age nineteen, Sean Combs used violence, threats, substances, and control over my career to trap me in over a decade of abuse." </p><p>Cassie wrote that Combs controlled her like a puppet. </p>
<p>"These events were degrading and disgusting, leaving me with infections, illnesses, and days of physical and emotional exhaustion before he demanded it all again. Sex acts became my full-time job, used as the only way to stay in his good graces," she said. </p><p>Cassie said she still has nightmares and flashbacks on an everyday basis and requires psychological care to cope. </p><p>"My worries that Sean Combs or his associates will come after me and my family is my reality. I have in fact moved my family out of the New York area and am keeping as private and quiet as I possibly can because I am so scared that if he walks free, his first actions will be swift retribution towards me and others who spoke up about his abuse at trial," Cassie said. </p><p>The AP does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has. </p><p>In an indictment, prosecutors asserted that Combs used his fame, wealth and violence to force and manipulate Cassie and Jane, now-ex-girlfriends, into the sexual performances he called "freak-offs" or "hotel nights."</p><p>Judge Arun Subramanian has signaled that he is leaning toward a substantial amount of prison time, twice <span class="link">refusing to grant bail</span> since the jury returned its verdict, citing Combs' history of violence.</p>

<div class="article-title">Bondi directs FBI, DEA, others to guard ICE facilities</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Attorney General Pam Bondi signed a memo on Monday directing agents from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and other Justice Department agencies to assist in guarding Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.</p><p>The move by Bondi — which she hinted at on Friday — came after one detainee was killed and two others were injured in a <span class="link">shooting</span> at an ICE field office in Dallas on Wednesday, the latest shooting or threat targeting an <span class="link">ICE facility</span> or immigration agent in recent months. She cast that attack as the latest act of "extreme political violence."</p><p>In a memo shared on X, Bondi said the FBI, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives should "immediately direct all necessary officers and agents to defend ICE facilities and personnel whenever and wherever they come under attack." She also announced the formation of a temporary "ICE Protection Task Force" that could include federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.</p><p>She singled out Portland and Chicago for operations to protect ICE facilities, and said she's directing federal prosecutors in both cities to seek charges against anybody accused of threatening or assaulting law enforcement. President Trump is also <span class="link">looking to deploy</span> <span class="link">hundreds of troops</span> to the two cities, drawing vehement opposition from local officials.</p><p>ICE has said attacks on its agents have spiked this year, as the Trump administration uses the agency to dramatically increase arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants. In recent months, ICE operations in <span class="link">Los Angeles</span>, <span class="link">Chicago</span>, <span class="link">New York</span> and elsewhere have drawn tense protests and clashes between agents and demonstrators.</p>
<p>On Friday, Bondi also floated a broader crackdown on "repeated acts of violence and obstruction against federal agents." She directed the Joint Terrorism Task Forces — which are regional entities scattered throughout the country that work with the FBI and with state and local police — to look into what she described as "domestic terrorism."</p><p>"The Department of Justice will seek the most serious available charges against all participants in these criminal mobs, including conspiracy offenses, assault offenses, civil disorder offenses, and terrorism offenses," the attorney general wrote Friday.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Trump signed a memo calling for investigations into "political violence and intimidation," led by the Joint Terrorism Task Forces. The White House pointed to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk earlier this month, last year's assassination attempts against Mr. Trump, and an increase in attacks on ICE officers.</p><p>The president also <span class="link">penned an executive order</span> labeling antifa a domestic terrorist organization. The move's legal implications aren't clear. Antifa, short for "anti-fascist," generally refers to a loose collection of largely left-wing activists, not a cohesive organization with a leadership structure. Also, domestic terrorism <span class="link">isn't a chargeable offense</span> under federal law, and the government doesn't have a formal list of domestic terrorist groups, unlike with foreign groups.</p>

<div class="article-title">Here's how Trump's proposed Gaza peace plan would work</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump offered up a 20-point plan Monday that he cast as a roadmap to end the Israel-Hamas war, a proposal that was backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — though it remains unclear how Hamas will respond.</p><p>The plan — which was <span class="link">presented as Netanyahu visited the White House</span> — calls for Hamas to return all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and for Israel's military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases. It proposes handing over parts of Gaza to a "technocratic" committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.</p><p>Mr. Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu that his goal is to ensure a "sustainable, long-term peace." </p><p>Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.</p><p>Netanyahu said Monday he supports the plan, which "achieves our war aims." He said if Hamas does not accept the offer, "Israel will finish the job by itself."</p>
<p>Hamas has not yet responded to the proposal. Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief met with negotiators from Hamas, who said they would review the proposal "in good faith" and provide a response, a White House official told CBS News.</p><p>Some unanswered questions about the plan still linger, including the exact timing of possible Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and the involvement of different international partners.</p><h2>Israel and Hamas would stop fighting, trade hostages and prisoners</h2><p>The plan calls for an immediate end to fighting if both Israel and Hamas agree to the plan, with Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip immediately withdrawing to an "agreed upon line."</p><p>"During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal," the plan states.</p>
<p>Within 72 hours of Israel accepting the deal, which Netanyahu appeared to do Monday, Hamas is expected to free all remaining hostages. Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.</p><p>In exchange, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, as well as 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the current conflict. The plan calls for the remains of 15 deceased Gazans to be returned for every one deceased hostage. The Israeli releases would take place after the hostages are released by Hamas.</p><p>The plan calls for Gaza to be demilitarized "under the supervision of independent monitors," with any weapons factories and tunnels destroyed and weapons decommissioned.</p><p>"A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people," one of the 20 points states.</p><h2>Aid and economic development would enter Gaza</h2><p>The plan states "full aid will be immediately sent" to Gaza, which has faced <span class="link">severe food shortages</span> and has fallen into famine in some regions, according to the world's leading authority on food crises. </p><p>It calls for aid deliveries that are at least equal to the levels agreed upon during a <span class="link">prior two-month ceasefire</span> that began in January, with supplies flowing through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza. It also states the plan would involve "rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries."</p><p>It states aid would be distributed by "international institutions not associated in any manner with either party," including the United Nations and the Red Crescent. The plan does not mention the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a <span class="link">controversial</span> U.S.- and Israeli-backed group that has handled many aid deliveries in the territory in recent months, whose members have been repeatedly accused of firing at Palestinians trying to get aid.</p>
<p>The proposal also floats convening a "panel of experts" that could draw up economic redevelopment plans for the Gaza Strip. It states Gaza would exist in a "special economic zone" with "preferred tariff and access rates."</p><h2>Gaza to be led by "technocratic" group and stabilization force, not Hamas</h2><p>After Israel withdraws from parts of Gaza, the plan calls for the territory to be governed by neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority, which currently oversees much of the West Bank.</p><p>Instead, the enclave would be governed by a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza." It's not clear who would participate in that committee, but the plan states it would be composed of "qualified Palestinians and international experts."</p><p>Overseeing this new governing structure would be a "Board of Peace" chaired by Mr. Trump.</p><p>In a press conference Monday, the president said he's slated to lead the board "not at my request, believe me. I'm very busy. But we have to make sure this works."</p><p>The plan also envisions an "International Stabilization Force" that would temporarily oversee security in Gaza. This group would be backed by the U.S. and Arab states, and tasked with training "vetted Palestinian Police forces" in collaboration with Jordan and Egypt. </p><p>It states Hamas would need to "agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form." But Hamas members would get amnesty if they "commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons," and members of the group who want to leave the territory would be able to do so.</p>
<p>The plan would also — at least temporarily — sideline the Palestinian Authority, which has played a key part in security and governance in the occupied Palestinian territories since the 1990s. The authority is dominated by Fatah, a political movement that has long been at odds with Hamas, and it has not governed Gaza since Hamas took over the strip in 2007.</p><p>Netanyahu has long criticized the Palestinian Authority. He said Monday the group would have "no role whatsoever in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation," including changes to its education system and an end to a long-controversial stipend system for the families of Palestinian militants.</p><p>The West Bank — which Israel has occupied since 1967 — is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. The Gaza Strip was also occupied in 1967, though Israel withdrew from the territory and removed its settlements in 2005. The territory has been under a tight Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas' 2007 takeover.</p><h2>Israel would withdraw from Gaza and won't annex territory</h2><p>The Israel Defense Forces would immediately withdraw from part of Gaza after a deal is reached. It would continue to withdraw from parts of the territory and hand over control to the new International Stabilization Force "based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization."</p><p>Israeli forces would remain present in a "security perimeter," however, until Gaza "is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat," the plan states. Netanyahu said Monday the IDF would remain in that perimeter "for the foreseeable future."</p><p>If Hamas doesn't accept the proposal, it calls for the plan to "proceed in the terror-free areas" that are handed over from the Israeli military to the new stabilization force.</p><h2>Plan calls statehood an "aspiration of the Palestinian people"</h2><p>The proposal does not lay out a clear roadmap for an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But it says that, if the plan works out, "the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people."</p>
<p>Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, and has castigated U.S. allies like the United Kingdom and France for recognizing a Palestinian state last week at the United Nations General Assembly, calling it an "absurd prize for terrorism." Mr. Trump has also opposed calls for a Palestinian state. But key Arab partners have backed Palestinian statehood and cast it as a necessary component of any long-term resolution.</p><p>The plan also pushes for an "interfaith dialogue process" to "try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis," and a "dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence."</p>

<div class="article-title">Investigation continues into fatal Michigan church shooting, fire</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Everyone is now accounted for in the aftermath of a shooting and fire at a Michigan church during Sunday services, authorities said during a press conference Monday. The FBI is investigating the Grand Blanc Township melee as "an act of targeted violence." </p><p>About 100 people were inside the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on McClandlish Road around 10:25 a.m. Sunday <span class="link">when the shooting happened</span>.</p><p>The suspect, identified as a 40-year-old <span class="link">Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan</span>, drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church, exited his vehicle and fired "several rounds" of an assault rifle at hundreds of churchgoers, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said.</p><p>"This was an evil act of violence. That's exactly what this was," Renye said.  </p><p>Four victims were killed in the shootings. The shooter is also dead, officials said. Two victims remain in critical condition at an area hospital, and six others were reported to be in stable condition, according to hospital officials. Henry Ford Genesys Hospital said it provided care for some of the victims.</p>
<p>The victims range in age from 6 to 78 years old. Henry Ford officials say that of the eight victims, five were treated for gunshot wounds and three were treated for smoke inhalation.</p><p>Monday's press conference was the final in a series of in-person reports, with local police saying additional updates will come from their social media. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was among those who spoke Monday, alongside FBI Detroit acting special agent in charge Reuben C. Coleman, Genesee County Sheriff Christopher R. Swanson, ATF special agent in charge of the Detroit Field Office James Deir and Michigan State Police Director Col. James F. Grady II. </p><p>Deir asked that area residents avoid the area near the church, which has been blocked off, asking for cooperation from the public as investigators continue to comb through the wreckage left by the fire. Over 100 victims and witnesses have been interviewed so far, Coleman said. Numerous special teams from state and federal agencies are working on the case, including a National Response Team from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p><p>In the meantime, the authorities praised the dedication of first responders and law enforcement at the scene, some of whom had only two months experience on the job, along with the immediate response of the church attendees during the incident. </p>
<p>"There are noble heroes who do not wear a uniform that went to that church yesterday .... Those heroes from that church did their job," the sheriff said.</p><p><span class="link">Survivor Paul Kirby told "CBS Mornings"</span> it was "the scariest moment of my life, not knowing if my family was OK." Kirby's wife and children were with him, attending a service at the church, when they heard "a loud boom coming from the back wall of the chapel."</p><p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said investigators were looking into how much planning went into the attack and whether any clues about the motive were left behind.</p><p>"From what I understand, based on my conversations with the FBI director, all they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith," she said Monday. </p><p>The shooting occurred a day after Russell M. Nelson, the oldest-ever president of the Utah-based faith, died at 101.</p><p>Sanford was an Iraq war veteran who deployed once for several months during 2007 and 2008, according to service records provided to CBS News by the Pentagon. Sanford served in the Marines for four years. </p><p>Crews in white coveralls and hard hats searched through what remained of the church on Monday morning. A silver pickup truck with two American flags in the back remained where it had smashed into the front brick wall near a sign that says "visitors welcome."</p>
<p>U.S. officials and state lawmakers <span class="link">shared messages</span> in response to the shooting, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered U.S. and Michigan flags to be lowered to half-staff through Friday to honor and remember the victims. </p><p>Grand Blanc Community Schools were closed on Monday. </p><p>Bloomfield Township Police says it will "increase patrols around our places of worship and other community gatherings to help ensure a safe environment for everyone." </p><p>The shooting was the latest of several attacks on houses of worship in the U.S. over the past 20 years, including one in August that killed two children at the Church of the Annunciation in Minneapolis.</p><p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is leading the investigation, has asked anyone with information to call 1-800-225-5324 or submit a tip here. </p>

<div class="article-title">Hurricane Humberto could bring dangerous surf to East Coast</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Hurricane Humberto is likely to bring dangerous surf to most of the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda this week, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said, adding that tropical storm conditions are possible in Bermuda on Tuesday.</p><p>The swells will likely cause "life-threatening surf and rip current conditions," the center warned.</p><p>Humberto rapidly strengthened over the weekend, reaching <span class="link">Category 5</span> strength on Saturday before fluctuating back down to a still-powerful Category 4 on Sunday. It had weakened to a Category 3 storm — still considered a major hurricane — by Monday night.</p><p>The storm is <span class="link">one of two systems</span> swirling over the western Atlantic. The other one strengthened into <span class="link">Tropical Storm Imelda</span> on Sunday and is forecast to become a hurricane, but move away from the southeastern U.S.</p><h2>Hurricane Humberto forecast and path</h2><p>Humberto's center on Monday was about 265 miles southwest of Bermuda. It was moving north-northwest at about 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph, making it a major Category 3 hurricane, according to the hurricane center.</p>
<p>The center of Humberto is forecast to pass west and then north of Bermuda on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Fluctuations in intensity are possible today [Monday]. Gradual weakening is forecast after that, but Humberto is expected to remain a dangerous major hurricane into Tuesday," the hurricane center said.</p><p>"Swells generated by Humberto will continue to affect portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Bermuda through much of this week," forecasters at the hurricane center warned.</p><p>People along the U.S. East Coast are expected to see the effects of Humberto for the next several days, with the potential for life-threatening surf and rip currents.</p>
<p>Humberto is the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. It came on the heels of <span class="link">Hurricane Gabrielle</span>, which wasn't impacting land as it headed farther out into the Atlantic.</p><h2>Forecasters also tracking Imelda</h2><p>The hurricane center is also closely monitoring a second storm system over the northeast Caribbean in the Atlantic, which strengthened into <span class="link">Tropical Storm Imelda</span> on Sunday and is expected to become a hurricane Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>A hurricane watch is in effect for Bermuda, meaning hurricane conditions are possible, due to the forecasted path of Imelda, the NHC said.  </p><p>Imelda was expected to bring "significant rainfall" to portions of Cuba and the Bahamas through Thursday, the hurricane center said. It will also likely produce flash and urban flooding, with the possibility of mudslides in higher terrain across eastern Cuba.</p>
<p>There was also a possibility it <span class="link">could interact with Humberto</span> — a phenomenon known as <span class="link">the Fujiwhara effect</span>, in which two different storms converge and either join or spin around each other. But CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said such an outcome is not considered likely in this case.</p>

<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Tropical Storm Imelda is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane on Tuesday morning, but maps show it moving away from the southeastern U.S., according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center.</p><p>Imelda is the ninth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed on Sunday in the western Atlantic.</p><h2>Tropical Storm Imelda forecast maps</h2><p>As of 11 p.m. ET Monday, Imelda was moving away from the Bahamas, according to the hurricane center's latest advisory. The storm's center was about 140 miles north of Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas and 205 miles east of Cape Canaveral, Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. It was moving north at 8 mph, the hurricane center said.</p>
<p>"A turn toward the northeast is expected later tonight [Monday] followed by a turn toward the east-northeast at a faster forward speed on Tuesday," the NHC said in its latest update, adding that the center of the system "should move away from the northwestern Bahamas" Monday night and "away from the southeastern United States on Tuesday," but would approach Bermuda on Wednesday.</p><p>Rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with up to 4 inches are expected through Tuesday across northeast Florida, coastal South Carolina and coastal sections of southeast North Carolina.</p><p>Swells generated by Tropical Storm Imelda and Hurricane <span class="link">Humberto</span> are affecting the Bahamas and will spread to much of the U.S. East Coast early this week, the center added, warning that they're "likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions."</p>
<h2>Tropical storm warnings and watches for Imelda</h2><p>A hurricane watch was issued for Bermuda, the hurricane center said. A tropical storm warning that had been issued for the northwestern Bahamas was canceled Monday night.</p>
<p>A tropical storm watch that had been issued for part of Florida's east coast, from the Palm Beach-Martin County line to the Flagler-Volusia County line, was canceled Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Imelda was expected to drop between 4 and 8 inches of rain across the northwest Bahamas through Tuesday, and 2 to 4 inches across eastern Cuba. State media in Cuba reported that a 60-year-old man died in Santiago de Cuba following landslides there.</p><h2>Imelda follows Hurricane Humberto</h2><p>Imelda came on the heels of <span class="link">Hurricane Humberto</span>, which rapidly intensified to a major hurricane over the Atlantic on Saturday but is not expected to reach land. Humberto reached as high as a Category 5 on Saturday before fluctuating back down to Category 4.</p>
<p>Forecasters said last week there was a small possibility the two systems could interact, creating what is <span class="link">known as a Fujiwhara effect</span>, a rare phenomenon in which two different storms merge and become entangled around a newly formed, common center. However, they said it wasn't considered a likely outcome in this case.</p>

<section class="content__body">
<p>A Mexican marine biologist was seriously injured after he was attacked by a shark while working off Costa Rica's Pacific coast and transferred to a hospital in the country's capital on Monday, authorities said. </p><p>Costa Rica's Fire Department said it had rescued 48-year-old Mauricio Hoyos from the attack Saturday and carried him on a 36-hour journey from Cocos Island, around 340 miles off the coast. Despite the serious injuries to his head, face and arms, Hoyos arrived at the hospital in stable condition.</p><p>"He was tagging species for monitoring and when he tagged one of the island's shark species, the shark turned," said Luis Fernández, a physician with the fire department. "It was about 4 meters long with an enormous bite force — it turned and bit him on the head."</p><p>Hoyos was leading a scientific expedition as part of the One Ocean Worldwide Coalition, a collaborative initiative that includes the organizations Fins Attached, For the Oceans Foundation, Reserva Tortuga and the Rob Stewart Sharkwater Foundation.</p><p>"Incidents like this are extremely rare," Alex Antoniou, executive director of Fins Attached, said on social media. "Dr. Hoyos is an extraordinary scientist who has dedicated his career to shark conservation, and we are deeply grateful for the support of the Cocos Island community in this very difficult time."</p>
<p>Cocos Island is a Costa Rican national park and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. It is renowned for its great diversity of species, particularly sharks.</p><p>In 2017, an <span class="link">American woman was killed</span> after being mauled by a female tiger shark near the island. Her dive guide was also seriously injured in the attack. Authorities at the time said it was the first attack of its kind near the national park.</p><p>According to Costa Rica's Ministry of Environment and Energy, there are about 14 species of sharks — including whale sharks, hammerhead sharks and tiger sharks — inhabiting the area, making it a popular spot for divers.</p>

<div class="article-title">Judge suspends Trump's plan to cut jobs at Voice of America's parent agency</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A federal judge agreed Monday to temporarily suspend the Trump administration's plan to <span class="link">eliminate hundreds of jobs</span> at the agency that oversees <span class="link">Voice of America</span>, the government-funded broadcaster founded to counter Nazi propaganda during World War II.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., ruled that the U.S. Agency for Global Media cannot implement a reduction in force eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees on Tuesday. Those employees represent the vast majority of its remaining staff.</p><p>Kari Lake, the agency's acting CEO, announced in late August that the job cuts would take effect Tuesday. But the judge's ruling preserves the status quo at the agency until he rules on a plaintiffs' underlying motion to block the reduction in force.</p><p>Lamberth previously ruled that President Trump's administration <span class="link">must restore VOA programming</span> to levels commensurate with its statutory mandate to "serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news." He also blocked Lake from removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA's director.</p><p>The judge had also ruled separately that the Trump administration had failed to show how it was complying with his orders to restore VOA's operations.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump signed an executive order in March effectively shutting down the taxpayer-funded broadcaster for what the White House has called "radical propaganda." CBS News reached out to the White House on Monday for comment.</p><h2>Judge cites "concerning disrespect" toward the court</h2><p>Lamberth accused the administration of showing "concerning disrespect" toward the court in response to his earlier orders to produce information about its plans for Voice of America.</p><p>Employees who sued to block the dismantling of VOA claimed the planned cuts would hamper the judge's ability to enforce the injunction he issued in April. "This Court should therefore preserve the status quo while the parties litigate compliance," their attorneys wrote.</p><p>Government lawyers accused the plaintiffs of impermissibly trying to micromanage the agency's operations. "Enjoining the reductions in force would be a wholly overbroad and improper remedy," they wrote.</p>
<p>Lamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1987.</p><h2>Can media agency continue to fulfill its "statutory mission?"</h2><p>The U.S. Agency for Global Media also houses Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba. The networks, which together reach an estimated 427 million people, date to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend U.S. influence and combat authoritarianism.</p><p>The broadcasters have for decades served to project American values around the world while sharing fact-based news in a variety of languages. With Voice of America falling silent, Republican Rep. Young Kim of California told <span class="link">"60 Minutes"</span> earlier this year that she worries the U.S. is <span class="link">ceding the airwaves</span> to foreign dictators.</p><p>"When we are in an information war and we stop broadcasting into those repressive governments and into repressive societies … they are not going to hear the truth," she said at the time.</p><p>Congress appropriated $875 million to the agency for fiscal year 2025 and required that $260 million of the funds must be spent by VOA.</p><p>In March, Trump signed an executive order calling for the agency to reduce its "statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law." A day later, VOA stopped broadcasting for the first time in 83 years. The agency placed almost all of its full-time employees on administrative leave.</p><p>In announcing the job cuts on social media last month, Lake said the agency "will continue to fulfill its statutory mission ... and will likely improve its ability to function."</p>
<p>"I look forward to taking additional steps in the coming months to improve the functioning of a very broken agency and make sure America's voice is heard abroad where it matters most," she wrote.</p><p>Plaintiffs' attorney Georgina Yeomans argued Monday that the cuts would cement the agency's programming at deficient levels that don't comply with the judge's orders. Yeomans said it's unclear who at the agency is making key decisions, such as which jobs to eliminate.</p><p>"We simply do not know," she said.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>In its push to hold captured territory in <span class="link">Ukraine</span>, Russia has turned to countries like <span class="link">North Korea</span> for added manpower. Now, it appears <span class="link">additional support</span> is also coming from Cuban mercenaries.</p><p>Videos obtained by CBS News appear to show Cuban nationals captured by Ukraine on the front lines with Russia. Ukrainian officials estimate as many as 20,000 Cubans have been recruited by Russia to fight as mercenaries.</p><p>"Cubans are looking for any way to get out," Florida GOP Rep. Mario Diaz Balart said. "They're recruiting Cubans from around the island with these false promises."</p><p>Ukrainian officials, who shared copies of dozens of passports belonging to Cubans they believe to be mercenaries, say Cubans are being offered one-year contracts with the promise of a $2,000 monthly salary. The average monthly salary in Cuba is about 6,500 Cuban pesos, according to government data, which is equivalent to less than $20. The average age of the mercenaries is 35. Many of those recruited live in poverty and are in desperate need of money.</p><p>One family of a Cuban national who went to fight in Russia told CBS News their loved one has been missing since November, and they haven't received any money.</p>
<p>Orlando Gutierrez Boronat, a Cuban-American activist and a member of the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, a human rights organization dedicated to a free Cuba, traveled to Ukraine last year and spoke to one of the Cuban nationals. Boronat said the prisoner he spoke to was told he would do construction, helping rebuild cities destroyed in the war.</p><p>"When he got to Russia, he found out he and dozens of other Cubans were being assigned roles in the front lines," Boronat said.</p><p>Officials in Ukraine have compiled a list of 39 Cubans who have been killed, but they believe the death toll to be much higher.</p><p>"Currently, we have three Cuban prisoners of war. Two of them have been captured in the last two months," Maryan Zablotskyy, a member of Ukraine's parliament, said.</p>
<p>"We think that, eventually, the number of Cuban troops will hit at least 25,000, becoming the No. 1 contingent of foreign troops in Russia," Zablotskyy said, which would overtake North Korea.<strong> </strong></p><p>Diaz Balart said this "absolutely does not happen without the coordination and the approval and the support of the Cuban regime."</p><p>The Cuban government denied any involvement and said it has cracked down on trafficking rings recruiting Cuban nationals. </p>

<div class="article-title">South Texas families grapple with dementia as researcher seeks answers</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>In Dr. Gladys Maestre, South Texas has found a national authority on memory loss. For years, Maestre has studied dementia by going door to door.</p><p>"Everywhere I go, people will pull me and say, 'My mother, my sister, I have a memory problem,'" Maestre said.</p><p>The results of her study, which was conducted through the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley's Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center for Minority Aging Research, astounded her. She found that close to 20% of people over 65 in the Rio Grande Valley have memory loss, versus around 12% on a national level. But she suspects the number is actually much higher — potentially up to 40% of the community.</p><p>Maestre is looking at genetic factors, health issues such as diabetes and pollution, and generational issues, including trauma and poverty.  </p><p>The reason why it's happening is unclear, but the impact is unmistakable. </p>
<p>For David and Dawna Johonnett, childhood sweethearts, it was love at first sight. But at 71, Dawna's worsening dementia brought them to Maestre's clinic, where she couldn't recall the shape of a circle.</p><p>When asked if she notices the changes happening, Dawna said, "Yes, I'm me, but I don't know how to say it, but it's not me anymore."</p><p>Texas alone has nearly half a million people with Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, according to the Alzheimer's Association and the Texas Department of State Health Services. State lawmakers this year overwhelmingly approved a $3 billion bill to fund dementia research over the next decade. Voters still have to approve it this fall, and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick hopes they do.</p><p>"I've never had a bigger response than this bill," Patrick said, adding, "It's only getting worse."</p>
<p>Maestre's cutting-edge research includes blood testing for biomarkers. They can identify who's at risk and put those patients on a prevention program.</p><p>For now, David and Dawna Johonnett feel as though they've waded into a darkening drama.</p><p>"How can we make the quality of life that we have now last?"

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who was initially <span class="link">relieved of his duties</span> after being <span class="link">captured on video</span> pushing a woman to the ground outside an immigration court in New York City has been returned to duty, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter told CBS News.</p><p>The officials, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal move that has not been publicly announced, said the ICE officer was placed back on duty after a preliminary review of the incident.</p><p>The move is a striking about-face, just a few days after the Department of Homeland Security released a statement denouncing the officer's conduct as "unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE."  </p><p>"Our ICE law enforcement are held to the highest professional standards and this officer is being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation," the department said in its statement on Friday. It's unclear where that investigation stands.</p><p>The ICE officer's actions garnered national attention last week, after videos surfaced on social media depicting his confrontation with a visibly upset Ecuadoran woman at the 26 Federal Plaza building, which houses Manhattan's immigration court.</p>
<p>The confrontation appeared to have started when the woman and her daughter tried to cling to her husband, whom federal immigration officers were attempting to take into custody. Officials were captured on video trying to separate the family, and one of the officers was seen grabbing the woman's hair. Footage shows the husband was ultimately detained by federal agents.</p><p>Another video depicts the woman confronting the ICE officer who was initially relieved of his duties. Visibly distraught, she confronts him. "Take me, too," she is heard saying in Spanish. Video appears to show the woman touching the officer with her hands. He tells her not to touch him.</p><p>The officer is then captured on camera pushing the woman to the floor in front of her children and a crowd of journalists and federal and court officials. The ICE officer is heard saying "adios" — or goodbye — several times during the altercation.</p><p>In a statement shared Monday, ICE identified the woman's husband as Ruben Abelardo Ortiz-Lopez, saying he illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in March 2024. The agency said he came onto ICE's radar after being arrested in June by local authorities for "assault and criminal obstruction of breathing or blood circulation."</p>
<p>ICE said the woman is also in the U.S. unlawfully and faces deportation proceedings.</p><p>Reached for comment, a DHS official did not address the officer being placed back on duty but called the woman's husband a "criminal illegal alien."</p><p>"President Trump and Secretary Noem are not going to allow criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens," the official said. "If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will arrest you and you will never return."</p><p>CBS News reached out to representatives for ICE and the White House for comment.</p><p>Soon after the videos of the altercation emerged, New York Rep. Dan Goldman and New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, both Democrats, urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate the ICE officer and explore "potential prosecution." Goldman accused the ICE officer of "violently" assaulting the woman from Ecuador.</p><p>"Not only should this individual no longer work for the United States government, but the Department of Justice should aggressively enforce the criminal laws against him, consistent with the precedents set by this administration," Goldman said in a statement.</p>

<div class="article-title">YouTube to pay $22 million for White House ballroom to settle lawsuit from Trump</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by President Trump, who sued the video-sharing platform and its chief executive for temporarily suspending Mr. Trump's account after the 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, court papers filed Monday show.</p><p>The bulk of the money is slated to go to a <span class="link">planned White House ballroom</span> backed by Mr. Trump.</p><p>The settlement, filed in the U.S. District Court in Northern California, ends a four-year legal battle between the company and Mr. Trump, who has also recently settled with <span class="link">Meta</span> and <span class="link">X</span> after suing the Big Tech firms for similar suspensions. Mr. Trump's accounts on Meta and X were restored in 2022, and his YouTube account was restored in 2023. </p><p>In January, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, agreed to <span class="link">pay $25 million</span> to Mr. Trump to settle a 2021 lawsuit <span class="link">over its own suspension</span> of his accounts following the Capitol attack. A month later, X <span class="link">agreed</span> to pay Mr. Trump $10 million to settle its lawsuit, which was filed before billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk bought the platform. </p><p>The lawsuit against YouTube argued that the suspension violated Mr. Trump's First Amendment rights because it was allegedly done "in response to coercion of the federal government." Attorneys for the tech firm had called that argument "meritless" in a 2021 court filing, and said forcing the platform to host Mr. Trump without any restrictions "would conflict with YouTube's own First Amendment rights."</p>
<p>In settling the lawsuit, YouTube and its parent company, Google parent Alphabet, agreed to pay $22 million to Mr. Trump, all of which will be directed into the Trust for the National Mall, a fund that is "dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating that National Mall" and "to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom" that Mr. Trump is building.</p><p>Some $2.5 million will go to the other plaintiffs in the case whose accounts were removed from the site, including the American Conservative Union.  </p><p>Trump attorney John Coale told CBS News, "Glad it's over," noting that the settlements in Mr. Trump's cases against tech companies have added up to around $60 million.</p><p>A representative for Alphabet did not comment on the settlement.</p>
<p>The Trump administration <span class="link">announced</span> in July that a <span class="link">90,000-square-foot ballroom</span> with a seated capacity for 650 people will be constructed in the White House's East Wing. </p><p>CBS News <span class="link">reported</span> earlier this month that corporate and individual donors have pledged nearly $200 million to cover construction costs, and fundraising is ongoing. Google, R.J. Reynolds, Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin, Palantir and NextEra Energy have donated, sources told CBS News, and so have firms in the tech, manufacturing, banking and health industries.</p><p>Mr. Trump has cultivated closer ties with tech companies since returning to office. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos attended his inauguration in January, and Musk led his administration's Department of Government Efficiency for months.</p>

<div class="article-title">ChatGPT introduces new parental controls amid concerns over teen safety</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT, announced new parental controls on Monday aimed at helping protect young people who interact with its generative artificial intelligence program.  </p><p>All ChatGPT users will have access to the control features from Monday onward, the company said.</p><p>The announcement comes as OpenAI, which technically allows users as young as 13 to sign up, contends with mounting public pressure to prioritize <span class="link">the safety of ChatGPT</span> for teenagers. (OpenAI says on its website that it requires users ages 13 to 18 to obtain parental consent before using ChatGPT.)</p><p>In August, the California-based technology company pledged to implement changes to its flagship product after facing <span class="link">a wrongful death lawsuit</span> by parents of a 16-year-old who alleged the chatbot led their son to take his own life. </p><p>OpenAI's new controls will allow parents to link their own ChatGPT accounts to the accounts of their teenagers "and customize settings for a safe, age-appropriate experience," OpenAI said in Monday's announcement. Certain types of content are then automatically restricted on a teenager's linked account, including graphic content, viral challenges, "sexual, romantic or violent" role-play, and "extreme beauty ideals," according to the company.</p>
<p>Along with content moderation, parents can opt to receive a notification from OpenAI should their child exhibit potential signs of harming themselves while interacting with ChatGPT.</p><p>"If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation," the company said. "If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out."</p><p>The company also said it is "working on the right process and circumstances in which to reach law enforcement or other emergency services" in emergencies where a teen may be in imminent danger and a parent cannot be reached.</p><p>"We know some teens turn to ChatGPT during hard moments, so we've built a new notification system to help parents know if something may be seriously wrong," OpenAI said.</p>
<p>OpenAI has introduced other measures recently aimed at helping safeguard younger ChatGPT users. The company said earlier this month that chatbot users identified as being under 18 will automatically be directed to a version that is governed by "age-appropriate" content rules. </p><p>"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult," the company said at the time. </p><p>It noted on Monday, however, that while guardrails help, "they're not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them."</p><p>People can use ChatGPT without creating an account, and parental controls and automatic content limits only work if users are signed in. </p><p>"We will continue to thoughtfully iterate and improve over time," the company said. "We recommend parents talk with their teens about healthy AI use and what that looks like for their family."</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission has started an inquiry into several social media and artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI, about the potential harms to teens and children who use their chatbots as companions. </p>

<div class="article-title">How would a government shutdown affect travel around the U.S.?</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Although a short U.S. <span class="link">government shutdown</span> would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups. </p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies would be expected to continue showing up on the job — without pay — even if lawmakers fail this week to strike a <span class="link">deal on federal funding</span>.</p><p>But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.</p><p>"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work," he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists. </p><p>Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the <span class="link">34-day government shutdown</span> that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.</p>
<p>"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer," Harmon-Marshall said.  </p><p>Barring a deal in Congress, a shutdown would begin at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.  </p><h2>$1 billion hit</h2><p>The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.</p><p>"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations," the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. "It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored."</p>
<p>The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year. </p><p>Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.</p><p>By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group said in a statement last week.</p><p>Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown. </p>

<section class="content__body">
<p>Video game company Electronic Arts (EA), known as the maker of the "The Sims" and "Madden NFL," is being acquired in a $55 billion deal.</p><p>The California-based company said Monday it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by a consortium of companies that includes Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund PIF; private equity firm Silver Lake, and Miami-based investment firm Affinity Partners, which is led by President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.  </p><p>If finalized, the deal would be the most expensive acquisition of a public company to be taken private in history — surpassing $32 billion paid to Texas utility TXU in 2007 to go private. </p><p>"The transaction positions EA to accelerate innovation and growth to build the future of entertainment," the company said in a statement.</p><p>As part of the agreement, which is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2027, stockholders will receive $210 per share in cash. Andrew Wilson, who has served as EA's CEO since 2013, will continue to lead the company once the transaction is completed, EA said.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts, which is headquartered in Redwood City, California, oversees a suite of popular video games including "Battlefield," "Apex Legends," "EA SPORTS College Football" and "Need for Speed" among others. In fiscal year 2025, the company posted a net revenue of approximately $7.5 billion.</p><p>The company was founded by former Apple employee Trip Hawkins in 1982. If the transaction closes as anticipated, it will end EA's 36-year history as a publicly traded company.</p><p>The $55 billion acquisition would also be one of the biggest game industry deals to date. The largest was three years ago, when <span class="link">Microsoft bought</span> video game company Activision Blizzard for roughly $69 billion.</p>

<div class="article-title">Here's what a government shutdown could affect around the country</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>As politicians in Washington spar over details of how to fund the government as a shutdown looms, the clock is also ticking for people across the U.S. who would be affected. </p> <p>Without congressional action, government funding will expire at 12:01 a.m. on<strong> </strong>Oct. 1. Anything deemed nonessential would be put on hold, so Americans could experience delays with certain services and hundreds of thousands of federal workers will go without pay. </p> <p>Here are some of the ways a shutdown would be felt across the country. </p> <p><em>Jump to state-specific impacts.</em></p> <h2 class="edTag"><strong>If you're flying soon …</strong></h2> <p>Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered "essential workers" and have to stay on the job, even if that means working without pay while the rest of the federal government shuts down.</p>
<p>If a shutdown dragged on, travelers could see more "sick-outs" of key personnel. That happened during the 2018-2019 government shutdown as workers showed their anger over missing paychecks.</p> <p>Lastly, if you're planning on any international travel in the new year, you may need to build in even more time for passport renewals. U.S. passport agencies will remain open, but it could take longer to process applications with some employees furloughed.</p>
<h2 class="edTag"><strong>What about the mail?</strong></h2> <p>The U.S. Postal Service will keep the mail moving as usual in the event of a shutdown. USPS is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.</p> <h2 class="edTag">Benefit and safety net programs</h2> <p>Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue, but there could be some delay in services, such as processing applications.</p> <p>In a shutdown, the first to feel the pinch could be the mothers and young children who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) food program. </p> <p>"The timing of this shutdown threat at the start of the fiscal year puts WIC at risk of rapidly running out of funds. A prolonged federal government shutdown of more than one week puts WIC families at risk," says Georgia Machell, president and CEO of the National WIC Association.</p>
<p>Whether WIC could continue under a prolonged shutdown would vary depending on whether states could access other contingency funds.  </p> <p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps) will last longer but could also run out if a shutdown dragged on.</p> <h2 class="edTag">There could be missed paychecks and lost jobs</h2> <p>Perhaps the biggest impacts will be felt by federal workers and active-duty military service members who will not receive a paycheck during a government shutdown. The White House is also threatening mass layoffs (a reduction in force, or RIF) of federal employees, in addition to furlough notices, if a shutdown happens.</p> <p>A shutdown would happen toward the end of a pay period, so the first full paycheck missed for federal employees would be Oct. 24, while for the military it would be Oct. 15.</p> <p>The only salaries the federal government will continue to pay during a shutdown will be members of Congress and the president, according to the Constitution. However, elected officials can request that their paychecks be deferred while a shutdown is ongoing.</p> <p>Federal employees and military members will get back pay once the shutdown is over.</p>
<h2 class="edTag">National parks are a big question mark</h2> <p>During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the Trump administration kept national parks accessible to the public, even as many National Park Service employees had to stay home.</p> <p>At the time, there were reports of damage and trash in the unattended parks. And a Government Accountability Office opinion in September 2019 found that the Trump administration violated federal law when it used entrance fees to keep the parks accessible.</p> <h2 class="edTag"><strong>The weather forecasts will keep coming</strong></h2> <p>Ahead of past possible shutdowns, the National Weather Service has said it would continue to provide routine forecasts, as well as extreme weather watch and warning information. </p> <p>Many other day-to-day weather operations will also continue uninterrupted, including urgent repairs to radar and other key equipment. But a shutdown could delay routine maintenance, upgrades and long-term projects for less critical services, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
<p>Previous government shutdowns have delayed the processing of long-term weather and climate data at other federal agencies.</p> <h2 class="edTag">FEMA will keep working, but funding is running low</h2> <p>Most of employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are considered exempt and will be available for any emergency or disasters. </p> <p>But the main funding source for FEMA, the Disaster Relief Fund, is running dangerously low and needs congressional approval for additional funds. </p> <p>During a shutdown, FEMA would implement immediate needs funding, and this could mean delays in reimbursements to states and local governments. Additionally, FEMA administers the National Flood Insurance Program, which will lapse after Sept. 30 unless there is congressional action.</p> <h2 class="edTag" id="state">State-specific impacts</h2><h3 class="edTag">Alaska </h3> <p>Alaska has one of the highest percentages of federal employees in its workforce, given its relatively small overall population compared with other states. </p> <p>About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska. President Trump's threat that federal employees could receive termination notices if there is a shutdown increases the uncertainty around how this crucial workforce to Alaska's economy could be affected.  </p> <p><em>For more on the impact in Alaska, head to </em><em>Alaska Public Media</em><em>.</em> </p> <p><em>— </em><em>Liz Ruskin</em><em>, Alaska Public Media</em></p> <h3 class="edTag">Colorado </h3> <p>Rocky Mountain National Park was the fifth-most visited national park last year. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that Colorado is evaluating its options and would be a "willing partner if needed to use limited State funds to keep our biggest park fully operational if necessary." </p> <p>"We would certainly ask the Federal government to keep the parks open and staffed, or create avenues for the state to assist in keeping parks open and protected," Polis said in a statement. "If Congress does not fund the federal government, I urge the Administration to prioritize the operations of the national parks that so many people love and are a huge economic driver for our rural communities, especially during leaf peeping season."</p>
<p>The National Weather Service confirmed it will continue to provide forecasts through its forecasting offices in Boulder, Grand Junction and Pueblo.</p> <p>— <em>Caitlyn Kim</em><em> and </em><em>Megan Verlee</em><em>, Colorado Public Radio</em></p> <h3 class="edTag">California</h3> <p>In response to KQED's questions, the National Park Service (NPS) pointed to its 2024 contingency plan and said a 2025 version is currently in the works, but did not specify whether it would be similar if a shutdown occurred.</p> <p>Emily Thompson, executive director of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks, said it's likely the Trump administration will try to keep all parks open through any 2025 shutdown. That prompted the group to author a letter, signed by 40 former national park superintendents, calling for parks to be closed.</p> <p>"Leaving national parks open without National Park staff to help protect visitors and resources is not only irresponsible—it's dangerous," Thompson wrote in a statement to KQED. "We don't leave museums open without curators, or airports without air traffic controllers and we should not leave our National Parks open without NPS employees."</p> <p>With NPS staffing already down by an estimated 24% at parks, the likelihood of poaching and vandalism would rise even further in the event of an unstaffed shutdown, said Bill Wade, executive director of the Association of National Park Rangers. He points to the destruction of trees at Joshua Tree National Park during the 2019 shutdown. Wade said he's also worried that park staff won't just get furloughed but are also at risk of being fired outright, after Trump directed agencies to prepare for mass firings should the shutdown occur.</p> <p><em>For more on how a government shutdown could impact the Bay Area, </em><em>head to KQED</em>.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Adhiti Bandlamudi</em><em> and </em><em>Sarah Wright</em><em>, KQED</em></p> <h2 class="edTag">Oregon </h2> <p>There are nearly 30,000 federal workers in Oregon. Each federal agency has its own shutdown plan, but workers can be regarded as fitting into three basic categories:<br/></p>
<ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"><li>About a third are not affected because they work for the U.S. Postal Service, the Bonneville Power Administration or other agencies with their own funding mechanisms.</li><li>Another third will be told to stay on the job because they are essential for public safety. That list includes airport screeners, air traffic controllers, border protection workers, federal law enforcement officers, in-hospital medical workers, members of the military, power grid maintenance staff and Veterans Affairs caregivers. They'll be expected to keep working but won't get paid until after funding starts flowing again.</li><li>The last group — also about a third of the local federal workforce — won't work during a shutdown. This group includes part-time workers for agencies like the Forest Service. In previous shutdowns, Congress has paid furloughed workers afterward.</li></ul> <p><em>For more on the impact in Oregon, </em><em>head to OPB</em>.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Kristian Foden-Vencil</em><em>, OPB</em></p> <p><em>NPR's Padma Rama and Emily Alfin Johnson edited this piece.</em> </p>

<div class="article-title">As sports betting explodes, should states set more limits to stop gambling addiction?</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>It's hard to promote moderation and financial discipline from the bowels of a casino.</p> <p>But that's what Massachusetts state workers try to do every day, amid the clanging bells and flashing lights of the slot machines.</p>
<p>At the MGM Springfield in western Massachusetts, these workers, wearing green polos, stand outside their small office, right off the casino floor.</p> <p>Above them the sign reads, "GameSense," the state's signature program to curb problem gambling. </p> <p>A mounted screen cycles through messages such as "Keep sports betting fun. Set a budget and stick to it."</p> <p>The workers hand out free luggage tags and travel-size tissues in an effort to get people to stop and chat.</p> <p>If they succeed, they give customers brochures with the state's gambling helpline number and website. They can even enroll them in a program, called Play My Way, that allows customers to set monthly spending limits on how much they gamble.</p>
<p>Outside the casinos, GameSense is marketed on social media and on sportsbook apps and websites. Meanwhile, the state's Department of Public Health puts its own moderation messages on buses and billboards.</p> <p>"That's a big movement in 12 years," says Mark Vander Linden, who oversees the GameSense program for Massachusetts.</p> <p>Massachusetts' first casino opened in 2015, and as the gaming industry grew, the state developed what it calls a "responsible gaming" program, funded by a surtax on gambling industry profits.</p>
<p>At first, the state regulators tried various strategies to educate customers about the addictive nature of gambling, as well as the financial risks.</p> <p>"It was much more about making sure that there are brochures that are available that explained the odds of whatever game it was," he says.</p> <p>Since then, Massachusetts has put in place additional regulations on a booming industry that now includes widespread sports betting. For example, there's no betting on Massachusetts college teams, and no gambling by credit card. All gambling companies have to allow customers to set voluntary limits and sign up for a "voluntary self-exclusion list" that bans them from casinos or sports betting over various time intervals.</p> <h3 class="edTag">U.S. has no national gambling policy, unlike other countries</h3> <p>Some states have set similar limits in an effort to curb problem gambling, but others have very few. In the absence of a nationwide policy, or a national gambling commission to oversee the industry, each state is on its own.</p>
<p>Now a growing number of addiction researchers and policy makers say it's time to take bolder — and more unified — steps to combat gambling disorders. They point to the explosion of the gaming industry since 2018, when the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door for states to legalize sports betting and unleashed an aggressive new industry, now legal in 39 states. (Forty-eight states have legalized at least some form of gambling, including lotteries.)</p> <p>Compared to the U.S., several other countries have gone much further in regulating the gambling industry, and some experts in the U.S. are looking to them as potential models.</p> <p>For example, Norway's government has a monopoly on all slot machines so it can control the types of games offered, and every gambler in the country is limited to losing only 20,000 kroner (about $2,000) a month.</p> <p>In the United Kingdom, there's a new 5 pound limit (about $7) on every spin on a slot machine, and gambling companies are now subject to a 1 percent levy that goes into a fund for treatment and prevention of gambling disorders.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a report published in the medical journal <em>The Lancet</em> called on international health leaders to act quickly on regulations before gambling disorders become widespread and common, and that much harder to stop.</p> <p>But policy leaders point out that the U.S. has less appetite for corporate regulation than many other countries, especially in the Trump administration. At the same time, they warn that doing nothing could pose a serious public health threat, especially now that sports betting apps allow people to gamble anywhere and anytime.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Fears that more gambling means more addiction </h3> <p>Even before the marriage of online gaming and cellphones, researchers had estimated 1% to 2% of Americans already had a gambling disorder, and another 8%of people were at risk of developing one.</p>
<p>Some U.S. politicians fear the problem will only get worse.</p> <p>"The sophistication and complexity of betting has become staggering," says Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. "And that's why we need protections that will enable an individual to say no."</p> <p>Blumenthal has co-sponsored the SAFE Bet Act, legislation that would impose federal standards on sports betting companies.</p> <p>The bill proposes a ban on gambling ads during live sporting events, mandatory "affordability checks" for high-spending customers, limits on "VIP" membership schemes, a ban on AI tracking for marketing, and the creation of a national "self-exclusion" database, among other rules.</p> <p>"States are unable to protect their consumers from the excessive and abusive offers, and sometimes misleading pitches," Blumenthal says. "They simply don't have the resources or the jurisdiction."</p>
<p>The gambling industry is strongly opposed to lobbying against the SAFE Bet Act. Federal standards would be a "slap in the face" to state regulators, says Joe Maloney, a spokesperson for the American Gaming Association.</p> <p>"You have the potential to just dramatically, one, usurp the states' authority and then, two, freeze the industry in place," he says.</p> <h3 class="edTag">'Responsible gaming' is different from a public health approach</h3> <p>New regulations are also unnecessary, Maloney says. The industry acknowledges that gambling is addictive for some people, he says, which is why it developed an outreach/awareness initiative known as "responsible gaming."</p> <p>That includes messages on buses and billboards warning people to stop playing when it's no longer fun and reminding them the odds of winning are very low.</p> <p>"There's very direct messages, such as – 'you will lose money here,'" Maloney says.</p> <p>He says his industry group does not collect data on whether those measures reduce addiction rates. But he says gambling restrictions are not the answer.</p> <p>"If you suddenly start to pick and choose what can be legal or banned, you're driving bettors out of the legal market and into the illegal market," Maloney says.</p>
<p>But public health leaders say the industry's "responsible gaming" model just doesn't work.</p> <p>"You need regulation when the industry has shown an inability and unwillingness to police itself," says Harry Levant, director of gambling policy for the Public Health Advocacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston.</p> <p>One reason the industry's approach is "ethically and scientifically flawed" is that it puts all the blame and responsibility on individuals with a gambling disorder, Levant says.</p> <p>"You can't say to a person who is struggling with addiction, 'well just don't do that anymore,'" Levant says.</p> <p>Levant comes to the issue from personal experience. He is in recovery from a gambling addiction himself. A former lawyer, Levant was convicted in 2015 for stealing clients' money to fund his betting habit. Since then, he has not only become an advocate for stronger regulations, but is a trained addiction therapist.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association says it supports treatment for gambling disorder, and helps pay for some referral and treatment services through state taxes. But Levant calls that "the moral equivalent of Big Tobacco saying, 'Let us do whatever we want for our cigarettes, as long as we pay for chemotherapy and hospice.'"</p> <p>Instead, Levant advocates for a public health approach that would help prevent addiction from the get-go. That means putting limits on marketing and on the types — and frequency — of gambling — for <em>everyone</em>, not just those already in trouble.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Can lawmakers stop 'the worst excesses' before the next gambling trend?</h3> <p>To make his case, Levant opens his laptop and pulls up a corporate infomercial produced by SimpleBet, a DraftKings subsidiary<strong>.</strong></p> <p>In the video, the company boasts about getting more people to gamble on sports through what's called micro-betting during live games. "We drive fan engagement by making every moment of every game a betting opportunity. Automatic, algorithmic, powered by machine learning and AI," the voiceover says.</p>
<p>That's the kind of constant engagement that promotes addiction, Levant says. (Contacted by NPR, DraftKings declined to comment.)</p>
<p>Some of those gambling mechanisms would be limited by the SAFE Bet Act, which Levant and his colleagues at the Public Health Advocacy Institute helped write.</p> <p>But if the legislation doesn't get through the current regulation-averse Congress, then states need to take strong action on their own, Levant says.</p> <p>The Massachusetts legislature is currently considering the Bettor Health Act, which would impose additional rules on sports betting companies.</p> <p>"The goal is not to stop gambling entirely," says Massachusetts state Rep. Lindsay Sabadosa, a cosponsor of the bill. "It's to stop the worst excesses of online sports betting."</p> <p>The Massachusetts bill includes some components of the federal legislation, such as mandatory "affordability checks." Those would cap how much money some gamblers can lose. Affordability checks are modeled on a pilot program in the United Kingdom.</p> <p>"If you're only allowed to have two drinks, we know that you're not going to get drunk, right?" says Sabadosa. "If you're only allowed to gamble $100 a day because that's an affordable amount, you're not going to go broke. You're still going to be able to pay the rent."</p> <p>The Bettor Health Act would also ban "prop" bets, which are wagers placed during a live game, like who makes the first shot in basketball, or who hits the first home run in baseball.</p> <p>But state tax revenue from sports betting rose to $2.2 billion in 2023 — a welcome source of funding for struggling state budgets. Because of that, Levant fears that state legislatures will shy away from further regulation.</p> <p>States may even be tempted by the promise of additional revenues from new types of gambling, such as "i-gaming." That refers to online versions of roulette, blackjack and other casino-style games, playable at any hour, from the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>I-gaming is currently legal in only seven states, but pending legislation in other states, including Massachusetts, could expand its markets.</p> <p>"We have empathy for how hard it is for states to balance their budgets in this current political environment," Levant says, "but states are starting to recognize that the answer to that problem is not to further push a known addictive product."</p> <p><em>This story comes from NPR's health reporting partnership with</em> New England Public Media <em>and</em> KFF Health News.</p>

<div class="article-title">With no guarantee of U.S. weapons, Ukraine races to make its own</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>LVIV, Ukraine — Ukraine's emerging arms industry is on display at an odd place here — an underground parking garage, beneath a gleaming new office building known as Lviv Tech City. </p> <p>Conference organizers chose this secure space so the event couldn't be disrupted by one of Russia's frequent airstrikes.</p> <p>"We're a Ukrainian company. We're building drones, all different kinds of drones," said Maksym Yakovlev, who works with FRDM Group, one of many firms making military drones.</p>
<p>Many Ukrainian drones cost $1,000 or less and are only used once. They simply fly into a Russian target and explode. The one on display here is a high-end model, the R-34-T. It has six propellers, carries 30 pounds of weaponry, and can be reused. They are sold in pairs, with the equipment to support them, for a little under $70,000.  </p> <p>"It's a heavy drone which flies in, carries grenades and explosives, drops them on the target, and comes back," said Yakovlev. </p>
<h3 class="edTag">An industry born of necessity</h3> <p>When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine's arsenal consisted largely of aging hardware dating back decades to when Russia and Ukraine were both part of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Ukraine burned through those stockpiles at a furious pace, and then became dependent on U.S. and European weapons.</p>
<p>President Trump is sounding more supportive of Ukraine following a recent meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the United Nations. </p> <p>But the U.S. president has not restored military assistance, which he halted after assuming office. Trump says NATO countries can buy U.S. weapons and give them to Ukraine. This is now happening on a limited scale, though not at the level the U.S. had been supplying weapons under former President Joe Biden.</p> <p>As a result, Ukraine is ramping up production as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p>Young Ukrainian tech entrepreneurs like Yaroslav Azhnyuk are leading the charge. </p> <p>"I lived in Silicon Valley for six years. I went through a very classic startup journey," said Azhnyuk.</p> <p>In California, he launched Petcube, a company that makes cameras to keep watch on pets.</p> <p>He brought that expertise back to Ukraine, and now makes cameras for drones. He says Ukraine is rapidly emerging as a Silicon Valley for the defense industry.</p> <p>"Ukraine today is the defense valley of the world," he said. "You sit in a cafe in Kyiv and you meet one defense founder, and then 30 minutes later, another defense tech founder passes by. The energy here is just incredible."</p>
<p>Zelenskyy says the country makes at least 40% of its own weapons overall, and virtually all its own drones.</p> <p>Ukraine had no real drone industry three years ago. It made more than 2 million last year and expects to make at least 4 million this year, according to Ukrainian officials and analysts following the war. </p> <p>The latest models travel hundreds of miles, striking Russian oil refineries and causing significant damage to that country's most important industry.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A need for more advanced weapons</h3> <p>Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of Ukraine's parliament who heads the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Ukraine had no choice but to build its own weapons.</p> <p>"We are outnumbered. Russia has more human resources," Merezhko said in an interview with NPR. "That's why we need more sophisticated weaponry to make up for this difference, to fill this gap."</p> <p>Ukraine still relies on the U.S. for its most powerful weapons, such as the Patriot air defense system, and F-16 fighter jets. </p> <p>Ukraine hopes it will still be able to work with the U.S. and Europe to receive resupplies as its fires off the missiles needed for those systems. </p>
<p>But with heavy weaponry as well, Ukraine is looking to build its own.</p> <p>The current buzz centers on the Flamingo, a cruise missile that packs a powerful punch and can travel 1,800 miles, according to the Ukrainians. Ukraine says it is building them now and hopes to be in full-scale production by early next year. </p> <p>Some skeptics say the Flamingo remains unproven and may be overhyped. But if it performs as advertised, Ukraine will have the ability to strike deep inside Russia with a large weapon made at home.</p> <p>"In terms of military technologies, we are not a burden for NATO, for Europe and for the United States. We are a very good partner, a very promising partner," said Merezhko.</p>
<p>For now, Ukrainian arms makers are still small and in need of investment. But Yaroslav Azhnyuk sees potential.</p> <p>"There is a big, big financial opportunity for the investors to come here," he said. "Ukraine is the wild east. It's the eastern frontier of the Western civilization." </p> <p>He acknowledges that much of the work in the near-term is up to Ukrainians like himself.</p> <p>"I've been working nonstop on these defense companies. We're seeing these companies making an actual impact," he said. "But I still don't think I'm doing enough. I have to be stronger. I have to be smarter."</p> <p>That means making weapons that fly farther and hit harder.</p>

<div class="article-title">'We survived, we are resilient': Remembering U.S. Indian boarding schools</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>"When I went to boarding school, I was 7," said Ramona Klein, speaking to a group clad in orange shirts at a vigil earlier this month in Washington, D.C. "My parents didn't see me — other than a little while during the summer — for four years. Some parents didn't see their children for 12 years."</p> <p>Klein attended the Fort Totten Indian Industrial School in North Dakota from 1954 to 1958. She said being cut off from her family was just one of the many hardships she faced as a student at a federal Indian boarding school, in addition to abuse and neglect.</p>
<p>She and many others will be marking Orange Shirt Day at events around the country on Tuesday, in remembrance of the tens of thousands of Native children who attended these schools, the goal of which was to "kill the Indian … save the man."</p> <p>The day of memorial is marked in Canada each year on Sept. 30, where it is formally known as the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, and is increasingly observed in communities in the United States.</p> <p>Klein spoke earlier this month at the vigil at the Indian Gaming Association conference center near Capitol Hill.</p> <p>There, organizers from the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition passed out orange T-shirts that read "Every Child Matters." Klein, a citizen of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, is the group's vice president.</p> <p>From 1819 to 1969, the federal government financed more than 400 Indian boarding schools. Native children were often forcibly removed from their homes and sent to these schools, sometimes hundreds of miles away, where many were abused and neglected.</p> <p>An investigation by the Interior Department found that, of more than 60,000 students who attended the federal Indian boarding schools, at least 973 American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian children died.</p> <p>"There was physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, academic abuse, intellectual abuse and neglect," Klein said. "If I didn't start healing, it would impact my children and my grandchildren."</p>
<p>The orange shirts honor Phyllis Webstad of the Stswecem'c Xget'tem First Nation, who attended a Canadian boarding school as a child. She now lectures and writes about the experience, including her story of how a bright orange shirt her grandmother had bought for her to wear at her new school was taken away on her first day.</p> <p>For current Indigenous students, honoring Orange Shirt Day is seen as a way of recognizing and correcting how education has been used as a weapon against Native children.</p> <p>"This was a genocide. We survived, we are resilient," said Nani Mahkuk-Guaman, a student leader at the University of Minnesota Morris. A building on the campus was part of a federal Indian boarding school from 1887-1909.</p> <p>The observances at that location, she said, are a way of "creating happy memories in a place where students didn't experience happiness."'</p> <p>Honoring boarding school survivors "is a way for us to heal," said Mahkuk-Guaman, 21, a descendant of the Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin and the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska.  "And to help us understand what our parents, grandparents — all of our relatives — went through." Several members of her family attended boarding schools.</p> <p>The horrors experienced in the boarding schools in the U.S. were for decades hidden or seldom acknowledged. Only recently, beginning in 2022, has the federal government accepted responsibility for its role.</p> <p>Some survivors have been reluctant to share what happened to them, even with close family.</p> <p>But Klein and others believe it is important to talk about their experiences, before it's too late.</p> <p>"If we don't remember what happened, it's going to get lost," said Klein, 78. "I'm closer to the end of life than the beginning of life, so I have to get busy. I have to stay busy so that it's not forgotten. … We remember all of the survivors, all of the kids who didn't go home."</p>

<div class="article-title">Federal workers who took Trump's buyout get final paychecks and an uncertain future</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Md. — Stephani Cherkaoui has a pot of Moroccan tea on the kitchen stove in her townhome, half an hour outside Washington, D.C. Her kids' artwork — her "favorite collection" — adorns the walls. Her cat, Dublin, settles himself on a kitchen chair.</p> <p>Over the past five months, Cherkaoui has had time to sit in this space and reflect on her decision to walk away from her government career. She's one of more than 150,000 federal workers who took the Trump administration's "Fork in the Road" buyout offer, resigning with pay and benefits through at least Sept. 30.</p>
<p>She agreed to share her thoughts and opinions with NPR, emphasizing that she does not speak for the government.</p> <p>Cherkaoui's last day at work was April 18. Since then, she has been getting her paychecks on schedule. Her family has remained on her government health insurance. For the first time in her life, she says, she has been able to just live.</p> <p>"It's goodness that's coming from a very terribly depressing place," she says. "I'm able to just breathe. It's a new kind of feeling that I've never experienced before. But there's definitely a lot of fear."</p> <p>Months of searching for a new job yielded a few interviews but no offers.</p> <p>Back in the spring, President Trump called the government buyout "a very generous offer."</p> <p>Cherkaoui would put it differently.</p> <p>"I do think it was a fair deal for me — as an individual," she says. "For the American people? No, they got robbed."</p> <h3 class="edTag">A deal offered to nearly the entire federal workforce</h3> <p>It was just eight days after the presidential inauguration when the Office of Personnel Management sent an email inviting nearly the entire federal workforce, more than 2 million people, to resign. The deferred resignation program, as the Trump administration called it, was modeled on a deal that Elon Musk — who was then leading the Department of Government Efficiency — had fashioned for employees at Twitter. Initially, employees had just over a week to decide whether to accept. Questions abounded over whether the deal was even legal.</p>
<p>In late March and April, a number of federal agencies reopened the offer. Doubts over the legality of the deal had eased. Uptake was far swifter.</p> <p>Now, with months of paid administrative leave coming to an end, those formally separating from the government are confronting a mix of emotions, including regret, resentment and resignation.</p> <p>Many say they would never have left their posts had they felt staying was an option.</p>
<p>Scott Kupor, director of the Office of Personnel Management, has spoken about the departures in a positive light.</p> <p>In an interview with the Washington, D.C., news radio station WTOP, he said the team designing the buyout "did as much as they could to be appropriately generous and give people as long of a runway as they could to go transition into something new."</p> <p>Kupor described this moment as an opportunity to usher in a new culture, where everyone in the government is always thinking about how things can be done differently — and better.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Proud to be doing essential work</h3> <p>Cherkaoui joined the Agriculture Department (USDA) in 2020 after serving as a medic in the Maryland Air National Guard and as a public school teacher, among other roles. As an instructional systems specialist, she managed training for the roughly 9,000 employees of the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, who ensure that the United States' meat, poultry and eggs are safe to eat.</p> <p>"We send inspectors into all of the meatpacking plants across the country," she says. "They're out here doing a thankless job, every single day."</p> <p>The agency's internal training site covered both routine human resources topics and job-specific tasks, such as how to take samples and get them off to a lab.</p> <p>"People can do what they do because of people like me. We enable that," she says.</p>
<p>Still, from the day Trump was reelected, Cherkaoui felt uneasy. She had heard him rail about waste and bloat in the government. She feared training would be among the first things to go.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">After passing on the first buyout offer, things changed</h3> <p>Cherkaoui did not take the Trump administration's first buyout offer, in late January. She thought it looked shady.</p> <p>But in the weeks that followed, managers at the USDA sent memos foreshadowing big changes ahead — mass layoffs, relocations and more. Rumors also ran rampant.</p> <p>"'It might be that we're moving people out. It might be that you could be busted down by two [pay] grades,'" Cherkaoui recalls hearing.</p> <p>During Trump's first term, some USDA staff members were relocated to Kansas City, Missouri. A move to the middle of the country was a nonstarter for Cherkaoui, given that her entire extended family lives in the Washington, D.C., area.</p> <p>So when she got the email from the USDA offering a second round of buyouts, in April, she took it.</p> <p>"It was the hardest button click I've ever clicked in my life," she says. "I went back and forth on it for a couple of days, but I knew ultimately that that was going to be the right choice."</p> <h3 class="edTag">A data analyst in the Midwest regrets leaving</h3> <p>In the Midwest, a data analyst for the Transportation Department was wrestling with the same decision.</p> <p>"I might have had a minor anxiety attack in the lobby of my building as I was pacing around, considering it," says J., who analyzed crash statistics, road quality, bridge quality and other trends for the government. NPR agreed to identify him by only his first initial because he fears professional repercussions for speaking publicly about a past employer.</p> <p>Like Cherkaoui, J. did not consider the buyout when it was first offered in January. But within weeks, Trump's Department of Government Efficiency had terminated the lease for his office as part of its broader downsizing efforts.</p> <p>"Within the calendar year of 2025, we were going to be out on the street," he says. "I really had no idea how that was going to pan out."</p>
<p>Adding to the uncertainty, Trump issued an executive order outlining a consolidation of some IT-related work. J. worried his job could be moved from the Midwest to Washington, D.C.</p> <p>Given this environment, he had started applying for jobs in the private sector, and by April, he had gotten a couple of offers. So right before the deadline for the second round of buyouts, he accepted the Trump administration's offer, went on paid leave from the government and soon started a new job.</p> <p>In the months since, things have not unfolded as he had expected. His agency's office lease was restored. His old team has not been slated for a move. Looking back, he feels he was forced into an impossible decision, threatened with changes that never came to fruition.</p> <p>Meanwhile, he says, his new job is not nearly as fulfilling as his work for the government. While the pay is roughly the same, he forfeited his good federal government health insurance and other benefits.</p> <p>"Now that it's been a couple of months, I very much regret my decision," he says.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A newcomer to the government leaves before really getting started</h3> <p>While a large share of the people who accepted the buyout offer were close to retirement, some were just starting their federal careers.</p> <p>Marie had barely gotten through onboarding at the Energy Department when she was faced with the decision over whether to leave. NPR agreed to identify Marie by her middle name only, because she too fears professional repercussions for speaking publicly.</p>
<p>Marie found herself in a particularly odd situation, having been fired in February as part of the Trump administration's purge of probationary workers — those relatively new to the job — and then temporarily reinstated by court order. Fearing her agency would fire her again at the first opportunity, she opted to resign during the second round of buyouts, giving up on her longtime goal of working on energy policy at the national level.</p>
<p>The Energy Department did not end up firing its reinstated probationary employees when the court order was lifted, nor did it conduct mass layoffs of other workers, as many had feared. A department spokesperson told NPR that approximately 3,000 employees participated in the deferred resignation program, roughly 20% of its workforce.</p> <p>Marie's search for a new job started slowly, despite her years of experience in the private sector. She believes one factor was the economic uncertainty caused by Trump's tariffs. She worried about stalling out her career. Between her onboarding, her firing and her administrative leave, she had not done any substantial work in almost a year.</p> <p>"I did some part-time research work over the summer, basically for free, because I just wanted to work and use my brain for things," she says.</p> <p>She was still getting her federal paycheck and benefits, for which she was thankful.</p> <p>"But as a taxpayer, I feel that it's a long time to pay someone not to work," she says.</p> <p>Finally, just in the last month, she got not one but three job offers. She accepted a position at a local utility and thinks it could turn into a long career. She hesitates when asked whether she'd ever want to work for the federal government again.</p> <p>"I don't think it would be something I'd be hurrying back to do," she says.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Hundreds of applications end in "No, thank you"</h3> <p>Cherkaoui, the former USDA training specialist, hasn't been so fortunate on the job front.</p> <p>It's not for lack of trying. The market in the Washington, D.C., area is saturated with former feds. The state of Maryland, home to several large federal agencies, lost 15,100 federal jobs between January and August, according to the Maryland Department of Labor.</p> <p>At 40, Cherkaoui has gotten very few interviews, despite her skills and even though she has been applying to jobs nonstop.</p>
<p>"Literally hundreds of jobs," she says. "It's just 'No, thank you; no, thank you; no, thank you; no, thank you; no, thank you.'"</p>
<p>So, she has launched a consulting business, the Sajai Company, and has landed one contract so far. She's also going back to school to get a doctorate in human and organizational learning. She hasn't abandoned her dream of leading training across the USDA one day.</p> <p>While Cherkaoui is at peace with where she has landed, she's troubled thinking about what others are going through.</p> <p>Since January, the administration has dismantled entire agencies and halted work mandated by Congress. The president and his appointees have fired people whose work involved holding the government accountable — watchdog agency leaders, inspectors general, Justice Department attorneys and people across agencies tasked with protecting civil rights.</p> <p>Just last week, the White House Office of Management and Budget told agencies to prepare for mass layoffs of people working on programs that are "not consistent with the president's priorities" in the event of a government shutdown.</p> <p>Cherkaoui understands why government workers may be reluctant to speak out in this moment, though it saddens her deeply.</p> <p>"I love my country. Being critical of my country — that's showing love. If I didn't love and didn't care, I would let you act like a damn fool," she says. "You have to be able to say something, and if you can't say anything, you're lost."</p> <p>Cherkaoui says her former office at the USDA has been disbanded. She estimates that about half of her colleagues left voluntarily, while the rest have scattered to different parts of the agency. These days, she finds herself thinking often of those who remain in government and everything they're enduring.</p> <p>"It is much more than anything that they've ever had to endure before," she says.</p>

<div class="article-title">EV sales surge in the U.S. ahead of Sept. 30 tax credit deadline</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The Republican tax and spending package that passed in early July brought an early end to federal EV tax credits, which are worth up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used ones. The credits end on September 30. Specifically, buyers need to have a binding contract in place by that time — the vehicle itself can be delivered later.</p> <p>Anybody who was thinking of getting an EV soon-ish suddenly had a four-figure incentive to get one <em>fast.</em></p>
<p>The result was pretty predictable: Sales of EVs shot up.</p> <p>"The past couple of weeks — even in the past several <em>days </em>— EV sales just exploded," says Matt Jones, the senior director of industry relations at the auto marketplace TrueCar. "It's been bonkers."</p> <p>Surveys have shown that many Americans were not even aware the EV tax credits existed. But some dealers and carmakers have been trying to raise awareness with ads focusing on the new deadline. For example, if you were shopping for a new Tesla this week, you would have seen a countdown clock on the website ticking away second by second to the last moment on Tuesday that you could place an order and still get the tax credit — if you met all the requirements.</p> <p>The automotive services and tech company Cox Automotive forecasts that EV sales in the third quarter — July, August and September — are up 21.1% from the same period last year, and up 30% from this spring. J.D. Power, another auto data giant, reports that EV sales made up more than 11% of the U.S. market in August — hitting a level "only achieved once before in December of 2024." At that time, buyers were also racing to lock in the tax credits before the Trump presidency began.</p>
<p>Used EVs are also selling quickly, and Cars Commerce, the company behind Cars.com, reports that vehicles under $25,000 — the ones that are potentially eligible for the used vehicle tax credit — are the fastest-selling EVs on the used market.</p> <p>The bump in EV sales was big enough to boost the entire auto market. According to the auto website Edmunds, this quarter will likely see the strongest Q3 new vehicle sales since before the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020.</p> <p>But there's a flip side, of course.</p>
<p>"The end of the tax credit created a rush in September, but it could also trigger an EV hangover in the months ahead," writes analyst Ivan Drury of Edmunds.</p> <p>In other words: All those people who raced to buy an EV early? Well, now they <em>won't </em>be buying one later this year. So the EVs that didn't get snapped up before the deadline might have a harder time finding a buyer.</p> <p>Like the rush, the hangover is expected to be temporary. Major automakers are still investing in EVs (partly out of a desire to compete with China), and the appeal of a quiet, low-maintenance vehicle that never needs a fill-up is unaffected by tax policy.</p>
<p>J.D. Power reports that more than half of new-vehicle shoppers say they're very likely or somewhat likely to consider buying an EV in the next year, and that number has stayed fairly consistent.</p> <p>But without tax credits, EVs may be less appealing to cost-conscious shoppers.</p> <p>The research firm Rhodium Group has estimated that the early end to the tax credits will reduce EV sales by 16 to 38% compared to how sales might have grown — and that's on top of other policy changes, like major changes to emissions rules, that are also expected to slow EV sales.</p> <p>So higher EV sales are probably still coming, but more slowly than expected. How much slower, exactly, no one knows.</p> <p>Automakers will be waiting to see what "natural demand" for their electric offerings <em>actually </em>looks like without the incentive of a big tax break.</p> <p>And car shoppers, for their part, will be waiting to see whether automakers can manage to cut prices and keep vehicles competitively priced despite increased pressure from tariffs — and without the largesse of the federal government.</p>

<div class="article-title">The MLB postseason begins Tuesday. Who should you root for to win a World Series?</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>October baseball is here a day early, with Major League Baseball's first postseason games scheduled to begin Tuesday afternoon.</p> <p>It's a wide-open field this postseason with no clear favorites like last year's Los Angeles Dodgers. No team in baseball this year won more than 97 games, making the 2025 Milwaukee Brewers the <em>losing-est</em> winningest team in baseball since 2013 (not counting the pandemic-shortened 2020 season).</p>
<p>That means it's anybody's World Series title to claim — including, potentially, one of three franchises that have never before won the Fall Classic. We've got the coasts: New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Diego, Boston, Philadelphia. And we've got the Midwest: Chicago, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Detroit. We've even got Canada! (Sorry, Southerners.)</p> <p>Still, with 12 teams in the mix, it can be a lot to sort out which to root for. Let us help.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Do you like rooting for a team that has never been here before? (In other words, are you a human with a heart?)</h3> <p>Of the five teams that have never won a World Series, the Seattle Mariners are the only to have never even <em>reached</em> the Fall Classic. We're talking about fans who have rooted for this team for 49 long seasons, watching as literally every other active franchise has taken a swing at a title. For a particularly bad 20-year stretch that ended in 2022, the M's had the ignominious dishonor of owning the longest postseason drought of any of the big four North American men's professional sports.</p>
<p>But the mood is suddenly sunny in Seattle, where catcher — and perhaps AL MVP — Cal Raleigh has had a historic year, becoming just the seventh player in baseball history to hit 60 home runs in a single season. Ownership bought big at the trade deadline and in September, the Mariners turned into the second-hottest team in baseball to claim an AL West division title for the first time since 2001.</p> <p>The Mariners' No. 2 seed means a ticket straight to the ALDS. They'll face the winner of the Wild Card Series between the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Guardians, both of which — despite their own long-running title droughts — have at least <em>played in a World Series </em>(and in the last 13 years to boot).</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Seattle's a no-go, but you otherwise dig that kind of underdog vibe? </h3> <p>Good news. Two other teams in the postseason have <em>also </em>never won the World Series. You can choose between the San Diego Padres, who haven't been back to the World Series since they lost in 1998, or the Milwaukee Brewers, who haven't returned since their last try 43 years ago in 1982. Fans of the Brewers and the Padres have suffered too!</p>
<p>Both teams have become playoff regulars in recent years but have yet to get over the hump. The Brewers emerged in July and August as baseball's hottest team. At $121 million, they are in the lowest third of payrolls in baseball, dwarfed by big spenders and fellow National League contenders like the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The Padres are bigger spenders, and that money has brought them some of the game's biggest stars, including outfielder Fernando Tatis Jr. and third baseman Manny Machado — but they keep running into their rivals, the Dodgers, in the postseason. (That won't happen this year unless both teams reach the NLCS.)</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Okay, enough of the underdogs. How about a good, old-fashioned rivalry? </h3> <p>The New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox used to be the most toxic rivalry in baseball. (The Dodgers and Padres have taken that crown for now; last year's poisonous NLDS will be tough to top.) But they have a chance to reclaim their crown when they meet for a best-of-three series in this year's Wild Card round.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter too much which team you choose. This is your chance to embrace the dark side. The Yankees are the Evil Empire, of course, but don't discount Boston. The Curse of the Bambino is way, way back in the rearview mirror these days, and the Red Sox have won four World Series in the past 21 years, and while yes, we are only talking about baseball, it's worth the reminder that seemingly every other Boston pro sports team has won at least one title since then too. (Honestly, this is making the Yankees seem long-suffering by comparison.)</p>
<p>The Yankees have a towering lineup, anchored by the otherworldly Aaron Judge who turned in yet another incredible season. His stats: .331 batting average, .457 on-base percentage, 1.144 OPS, plus 53 home runs — something he's now doing with such regularity that it's almost becoming boring. The Red Sox bring a spottier lineup but better pitching, especially in starter Garrett Crochet and closer Aroldis Chapman, who has posted the best ERA of his career in his [checks notes] <em>age 37 season</em>.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Do you love hitting for contact? </strong></h3> <p>Only seven players finished the season with a batting average of .300 or higher — and the Toronto Blue Jays, the AL's top seed, have two of them, shortstop Bo Bichette and designated hitter George Springer. Add in first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (.292) and catcher Alejandro Kirk (.282) and the Blue Jays boast <em>four</em> players hitting .280 or higher. The next-most is just two.</p>
<p>It's not small ball, exactly, that the Blue Jays play. (Their 77 stolen bases this season was third-lowest in the majors, and most playoff teams hit more sacrifice flies than Toronto.) But the team led the league in batting average, hits and on-base percentage. They were second-to-last in strikeouts. Other teams hit more home runs and scored more runs, but the Blue Jays got men on base a <em>ton</em>. Now that's baseball.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Do you just want to root for a winner? </h3> <p>The Philadelphia Phillies could be your team. This team is a powerhouse: slugger Kyle Schwarber (56 home runs), shortstop Trea Turner (.304 batting average), outfielder Harrison Bader (who has hit .305 since joining the Phillies in a trade), first baseman Bryce Harper and outfielder Nick Castellanos (75 and 72 RBIs, respectively). Even though they lost their ace starter Zack Wheeler to injury in August, this is still a great team that can crush anyone on any day.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, their 2024 World Series rings still fresh from the jeweler, are a good choice too. The Dodgers are dealing with some injuries, including to catcher Will Smith, but what team is 100% healthy? And this top of the order will never not be crazy: Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, all three of them MVPs.</p> <p>Since he returned to the mound in July after elbow surgery, the two-way phenom Ohtani has posted a 2.87 ERA as a pitcher, the second-best of his career. Yet Ohtani had to use his limited appearances this year as a sort of rehab assignment, usually pitching just a few innings, and he only lasted a full six innings for the first time last week.</p> <p>That prompted questions for some about how Ohtani might fit in a postseason strategy. On Monday, his teammate Betts dismissed those concerns.</p> <p>"I think with him probably being the best player in the world, he can fit in wherever he wants to fit in," Betts told reporters. "Whenever he feels like he needs to go in and pitch, I'm pretty positive nobody with a Dodgers uniform will say no."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Or do you just want to watch some great young players? </h3> <p>Then tune in to it all. Don't miss the Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal, who is at the peak of his powers and looks destined to win the second Cy Young with his career-best 2.21 ERA. The Chicago Cubs are a likable bunch, with center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong, who's due for a bounceback after cooling off from a hot start in the second half. And the Cincinnati Reds have one of the most electric players in the sport in shortstop Elly de la Cruz, who is making his playoff debut in a Wild Card series against the Dodgers. You can't go wrong.</p>

<div class="article-title">Government to shut down after midnight barring last minute breakthrough in Congress</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Congress seems to be careening toward a government shutdown, as Democratic and Republican leaders remain at an impasse over funding negotiations and expiring health care subsidies. Lawmakers have less than 24 hours to reach a deal before a midnight deadline.</p> <p>Senate Democrats have refused to back the spending bill in an effort to force Republicans to negotiate on federal health care subsidies. They are pushing for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year in exchange for their support. Democrats also want to repeal cuts to health care programs that were enacted by the GOP's tax and spending bill passed earlier this summer.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., met with President Trump at the White House Monday in hopes of reaching an agreement.</p> <p>But the two parties walked away saying major differences remained. Democrats vowed to continue to push for concessions on health care.</p> <p>Trump went on to taunt Democrats after the meeting. He posted a racist AI generated video on social media. It included mariachi music in the background and an image of Jeffries with a sombrero and a drawn-on mustache. This was accompanied by a vulgar, crudely deep-faked voiceover of Schumer denigrating Democrats.</p> <p>Jeffries dismissed the video in a social media response, saying "Bigotry will get you nowhere."</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Thune accused Democrats of "hijacking" the process with a push to address an issue he argued should be dealt with on a separate track. He pointed out that Democrats have voted repeatedly for stopgap bills in the past.</p> <p>The standoff over spending could have major consequences for federal workers and people who rely on government services, particularly as the White House threatens to permanently fire some federal workers deemed non-essential in a shutdown. The move is a dramatic escalation in the increasingly frequent battle over federal spending.</p>
<p>House Republicans narrowly passed a continuing resolution earlier this month that would fund the government through Nov. 21, but that measure did not win the Democratic support needed to reach a 60-vote threshold in the Senate.</p> <p>The Senate is expected to bring up the House passed bill and the Democrats' alternative bill for votes again Tuesday afternoon, just hours before funding is set to run out. Both again are not expected to get the 60 votes needed to advance.</p> <h3 class="edTag">No resolution following a meeting at the White House</h3> <p>Congressional leaders met with President Trump and Vice President Vance on Monday afternoon, but left without a deal. After the meeting, Vance accused Democrats of holding government funding hostage.</p> <p>"I think we're headed to a shutdown because the Democrats won't do the right thing," Vance said. "I hope they change their mind, but we're going to see."</p> <p>Schumer, however, said it's on Republicans to negotiate a bipartisan agreement.</p> <p>"Their bill has not one iota of Democratic input. That is never how we've done this before," said Schumer. "When I was leader, we negotiated four times with Republicans, and we never had a shutdown. And so it's up to the Republicans whether they want a shutdown or not."</p> <p>Lawmakers from both party's positions appeared to harden on Monday evening, and most signaled no viable path to averting a shutdown. House Democrats gathered at the Capitol, but Speaker Johnson has not called the chamber back into session for votes, and it's likely to stay out of session as a shutdown starts.</p> <p>Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., told reporters there was still time for some sort of solution, but GOP lawmakers were ignoring a major problem if they insisted on no provisions to deal with increasing costs.</p> <p>"They must not be talking to the people I'm talking to in Georgia who are hurting and who cannot afford this astronomical hike that we are going to see in their health care premiums. People can't afford that."</p>
<p>Schumer's latest strategy<strong> </strong>comes almost six months after he and several other Senate Democrats voted to advance a GOP stopgap plan that avoided a government shutdown and pushed back the deadline to September. The move infuriated many within the Democratic base and fueled calls for the party to fight harder against Trump's agenda.</p> <p>Republicans argue the stopgap bill allows the committees negotiating the spending bills more time to finish bipartisan spending bills.</p> <p>"I think it will send a real sense of confidence across the country that we're actually capable of doing the very basics of our job up here," Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., told reporters in the capitol on Monday. Rounds says he and other Republicans are open to addressing health care costs. "Even though none of us were supportive of the ACA to begin with, we can't walk away from the people who have had no place else to go to get their health care coverage."</p> <h3 class="edTag">What's affected in a shutdown?</h3> <p>While critical services such as Social Security and payments from Medicare and Medicaid, would continue, there could be delays in processing new applications for those programs.</p> <p>In a shutdown, anything deemed nonessential is put on hold, so Americans could experience delays in certain services and hundreds of thousands of federal workers will go without pay.</p> <p>In a move to seemingly raise the stakes, the White House's budget arm issued a memo that instructed federal agencies to prepare to lay off workers permanently, instead of the traditional temporary furlough.</p> <p>Congressional Democrats panned the memo as an intimidation tactic.</p> <p>"This is nothing less than mafia-style blackmail," Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told NPR. "Essentially, the president is threatening to fire dedicated federal employees who have nothing to do with the ongoing political and policy dispute."</p> <p>If the administration makes good on its threat, it could mean that whenever the federal government does reopen, it would have a smaller workforce.</p>
<p>Typically, the White House budget office would collect and release agency shutdown plans. This time, each individual agency is responsible for posting and sharing their plans, which has caused a confusing patchwork of information for those seeking to understand the scope of a potential shutdown. However, the White House is saying the Women and Infant Children program, known as WIC, will be among the programs hit quickest in a shutdown. The program provides nutrition assistance and healthcare screenings to mothers and young children.<br/></p> <p><em>NPR's Tamara Keith and Elena Moore contributed to this report.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Trump, Hegseth to headline a highly unusual gathering of top military officials</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's meeting with top U.S. military leaders Tuesday in Quantico, Va., would be highly unusual at any time, but it's made more unusual by the fact that President Trump said he would attend the gathering.</p> <p>"It's really just a very nice meeting talking about how well we're doing militarily, talking about being in great shape, talking about a lot of good, positive things. It's just a good message," Trump told NBC News. "We have some great people coming in, and it's just an 'esprit de corps.' You know the expression 'esprit de corps'? That's all it's about. We're talking about what we're doing, what they're doing and how we're doing."</p>
<p>Those details are the most public yet to emerge about the gathering since U.S. military officials confirmed to NPR that Hegseth had ordered hundreds of generals and admirals to the Marine Corps base in Quantico. News of the meeting was first reported in <em>The</em> <em>Washington Post</em>.</p> <p>But the lack of details led to speculation that Hegseth, who has made a "warrior ethos" central to his view of the military, might use the occasion to fire generals. The defense secretary has long called for reducing the number of admirals and generals, who stand at more than 800, by about 20%.</p> <p>The presence of military leaders from across the globe at one central location presents challenges from both an operational and a national security perspective. The president's attendance adds to those challenges.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>SIDOARJO, Indonesia — Rescuers ran oxygen and water to students trapped in the unstable concrete rubble of a collapsed school building in Indonesia, as they desperately worked to free survivors Tuesday a day after the structure fell. At least three students were killed, more than 100 were injured and dozens were presumed buried in the rubble.</p> <p>Rescue workers, police and soldiers digging through the night pulled out eight weak and injured survivors more than eight hours after the collapse at Al Khoziny Islamic Boarding School in the East Java town of Sidoarjo. Rescuers saw additional bodies, indicating the death toll was likely to rise.</p>
<p>Rescue efforts were temporarily suspended at 10:15 a.m. as the collapsed concrete shook suddenly. People immediately ran for their lives, fearing another collapse, as rescuers urged everyone in the area to avoid the building, including more than a dozens of ambulances that parked near the scene. The work resumed around 1:45 p.m.</p> <p>The students are mostly boys in grades seven to 11, between ages 12 and 18.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Grieving relatives</h3> <p>Families anxiously awaited news at hospitals or near the collapsed building. A notice posted at the school complex Tuesday morning listed 65 students as missing. National Disaster Management Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari revised the number of people presumed buried in the rubble to 38 by midday.</p> <p>"Oh my God... my son is still buried, oh my God please help!" a mother cried hysterically upon seeing her child's name on the board, followed by the cries of other parents whose relatives had suffered a similar fate.</p> <p>"Please, sir, please find my child immediately," cried a father, holding the hand of one of the rescue team members.</p> <p>Heavy slabs of concrete and other rubble and unstable parts of the building hampered search and rescue efforts, said Nanang Sigit, a search and rescue officer who lead the effort. Heavy equipment was available but not being used due to concerns that it could cause further collapse.</p>
<p>"We have been running oxygen and water to those still trapped under the debris and keeping them alive while we work hard to get them out," Sigit said. He added that rescuers saw several bodies under the rubble but were focused on saving those who were still alive.</p> <p>Several hundred rescuers were involved in the effort and had equipment for breathing, extrication, medical evacuation and other support tools.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A century-old Islamic boarding school</h3> <p>Islamic boarding schools are commonly called as "pesantren" in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation, and its students who are called as "santri." Unlike students in public schools, the santri board in dormitories, because apart from studying formal education, they also study Islamic religious knowledge intensively, and they return home only during school holidays.</p> <p>Government data showed more than 42,400 pesantren listed in 2024 in Indonesia with 3,4 million santris and 370,000 Islamic teachers and preachers.</p> <p>Al Khoziny is named after K.H. Raden Khozin Khoiruddi, an influential figure in East Java, and several prominent Islamic scholars have studied at the school. The community often calls it the Buduran Islamic Boarding School, referring to its location in Buduran village of Sidoarjo district.</p> <p>It's the oldest among 7,300 pesantrens in the province. The first students were recorded as studying in 1920, before the boarding school was officially established in 1927.</p> <p>More than 2,000 santris study at al Khoziny, ranging from junior high school level to college.</p> <h3 class="edTag">The casualties and injuries</h3> <p>The students had been performing afternoon prayers in a building that was undergoing an unauthorized expansion when it suddenly collapsed on top of them, provincial police spokesperson Jules Abraham Abast said.</p> <p>Residents, teachers and administrators assisted injured students, many with head injuries and broken bones. Female students were praying in another part of the building and managed to escape, survivors said.</p> <p>One male student, a 13-year-old boy, was found dead on Monday and 102 students and teachers were injured and taken to hospitals, some of them in critical condition, Muhari said. By Tuesday, 75 students and two teachers were still hospitalized, he said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, two male students died from their injuries while being treated in Notopuro General Hospital, the hospital director Atok Irawan said. The two were among 11 students who initially were pulled out alive from the rubble by rescuers, he said.</p> <p>At least one student had to have his arm amputated and two others underwent surgery for head injuries, Irawan said.</p> <p>Authorities were investigating the cause of the collapse. Abast said the old prayer hall was two stories but two more were being added without a permit.</p> <p>"The old building's foundation was apparently unable to support two floors of concrete and collapsed during the pouring process," Abast said.</p>
