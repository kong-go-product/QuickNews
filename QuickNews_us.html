<div class="article-title">With a nuclear backdrop, Trump eases tensions with Xi but merely returns to the status quo</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Donald Trump, who prides himself on being a peacemaker, is going nuclear.</p><p>For more than 30 years, the Americans and the Russians – and before that, the Soviets – negotiated over limiting nukes. The theory was simple: Both countries had the power to destroy the world several times over, so why spend untold billions on an endless arms race?</p><p>Trump made the announcement just before meeting with the president of China, which is the third-ranking nuclear power, but is quickly catching up.</p><p>"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis," the president wrote. Although "we have more nuclear weapons than anybody," he added about testing, "I think it’s appropriate that we do also."</p><p>This comes as Vladimir Putin is doing some military muscle-flexing, saying he’s developing a "Poseidon" nuclear-powered torpedo that could bury a country such as the United Kingdom under a tsunami of radioactive water, rendering it uninhabitable. </p><p>I’ll leave it to the experts to debate whether it makes sense for Trump to plunge into a costly weapons buildup in a rapidly changing nuclear landscape. </p><p>But politically it may be a tough sell at a time the White House says it can’t find the money to keep the SNAP program from shutting down on Saturday, because of the government shutdown that has now reached the one-month mark.</p><p>The contrast led to a bitter exchange with Chuck Schumer, who said Trump was "gallivanting in Asia, dancing in Malaysia" rather than meeting with Democrats to end the shutdown. The president, saying he’s worked really hard, called Schumer’s remarks "almost treasonous!!!"</p><p>It’s true that Trump hasn’t really engaged on the shutdown, hoping the other party will be pressured by the rising level of pain.</p><p>Now that the dust has settled, it seems that Trump didn’t walk away with much from his 90-minute session with Xi Jinping, other than papering over their differences.</p><p>Both sides agreed to postpone higher tariffs for a year, which eases tensions but is really just a return to the status quo. It’s a classic Trumpian tactic of making threats and softening his stance later. Maybe he’ll even agree to talk to Canada again after his pique about that Reagan ad on tariffs.</p><p>There wasn’t a word on TikTok, which was thought to be one of the easier problems to solve. Trump has lined up some wealthy allies to buy the hugely popular app, but he needs Xi’s approval – and didn’t get it.</p><p>During their talk in South Korea, Xi also agreed to postpone restrictions on rare earth minerals that are crucial for making today’s ultra-fast computer chips.</p><p>Beijing also agreed to resume its purchases of American soybeans to previous levels over the next three years. That’s good news for our farmers, but again, basically a return to previous levels. Treasury Secretary Howard Bessent says the level could go even higher, but that’s just an optimistic guess.</p><p>Xi, by contrast, cares about one issue above all – and Trump says it didn’t come up (unless it is being kept secret).</p><p>It’s Taiwan.</p><p>Several reports say Xi had hoped Trump would slightly soften his language on what China views as a breakaway province. The U.S. has always pledged to defend the island if it’s attacked. Xi didn’t expect it, but a Trump statement that the U.S. doesn’t support Taiwan independence – which other presidents, including Bill Clinton, have said – would help the Chinese dictator gauge the climate if he does decide to move against the country (as we see it) 100 miles off its coast.  </p><p>Trump has claimed that China doesn’t want to invade Taiwan, and didn’t say much to reporters beyond "Taiwan is Taiwan."</p><p>All this amounts to a welcome reset of U.S. relations with China, easing months of harsh rhetoric. But Trump, who now plans to visit China, essentially brought things back to square one.</p><p>: I’ve been saying for months that Trump was not going to seek a third term, that he was basically trolling the press by toying with the idea.</p><p>Turns out I was right.</p><p>"I guess I’m not allowed to run," which is "too bad," he told reporters on Air Force One. He’s right. It’s flatly prohibited by the Constitution.</p><p>So for all the media speculation, some of it stoked by Steve Bannon, some of it sparked by his grand ballroom plan – why build it if he wouldn’t be using it? – Trump was never serious about it.</p><p>No president wants to be viewed as a premature lame duck. By leaving the door ajar, Trump projected the idea that the press, the politicians and the public might have to deal with him after 2028. But now it’s been slammed shut.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Ravens’ Lamar Jackson lights up Dolphins with 4 TDs in dominant return from injury</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Lamar Jackson’s return to the Baltimore Ravens couldn’t have gone much better. The former MVP threw four touchdown passes to lead a 28-6 rout of the Miami Dolphins on "Thursday Night Football."</p><p>Jackson had missed the last four games with a hamstring injury, watching from the sidelines as Baltimore slid into a rut. After last week's win moved the Ravens to 2-6, head coach John Harbaugh confirmed Jackson would be back for Week 9 – and he delivered. </p><p>While he didn’t test that hamstring too much with his usual Houdini scrambling act, Jackson’s arm wanted to let loose, having been dormant for a month. </p><p>It came in the first quarter after the Ravens’ defense forced a fumble on Tahj Washington that put Baltimore on Miami’s seven-yard line. After Derrick Henry attempted to get in twice and failed, Jackson rolled out on fourth-and-goal and found his trusty tight end Mark Andrews to make it a 7-3 ballgame. </p><p>Then, after a missed Dolphins field goal, Jackson led the way on a seven-play, 75-yard drive where Andrews was open yet again, this time catching and running 20 yards into the end zone for a 14-3 Ravens lead. </p><p>Meanwhile, Tua Tagovailoa was hearing a shower of boos that only got louder with each quarter as the Dolphins struggled to find the colored paint. In fact, they didn’t do it throughout the night despite reaching the red zone five times. </p><p>With a 14-6 first half lead, Jackson and the Ravens decided to blow this game open with a methodically, 11-play drive that ended with a Charlie Kolar touchdown. The Dolphins were only able to run seven total plays in the third quarter, and Jackson found Rashod Bateman for his fourth touchdown pass of the contest as even more jeers rained down from the Hard Rock Stadium crowd. </p><p>They reached a peak in the fourth quarter when a 12-play Dolphins drive ended with a Malik Washington fumble in the red zone, while Tagovailoa was intercepted by rookie Malachi Starks to seal the game. </p><p>In the box score, Jackson was 18-of-23 for 204 yards with his four touchdowns, while rushing for just 15 yards. Henry, though, rushed for 119 yards on 19 carries, while Zay Flowers caught five Jackson passes for 64 yards. </p><p>For Miami, Tagovailoa was 25-for-40 for 261 yards with no touchdowns and one interception. De’Von Achane, the Dolphins’ dynamic running back, rushed for 67 yards and caught six passes for 39 yards. Jaylen Waddle led the game with 82 yards on six receptions. </p><p>The Ravens know they need to extend this win streak to reach their playoff goals after a 1-6 start to the season, and that’s exactly what they got in Jackson’s return. </p><p>On the other hand, the Dolphins still have a lot to figure out after a promising win over the Atlanta Falcons last week. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Sen. Warner blasts Trump admin for excluding Democrats from briefings on boat strikes: 'Deeply troubling'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, slammed the Trump administration after it held briefings with only Republican lawmakers on the U.S. military strikes targeting alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.</p><p>Warner called the move to exclude Democrats from the national security briefings "indefensible and dangerous."</p><p>"Shutting Democrats out of a briefing on U.S. military strikes and withholding the legal justification for those strikes from half the Senate is indefensible and dangerous," the senator said in a statement. "Decisions about the use of American military force are not campaign strategy sessions, and they are not the private property of one political party."</p><p>"For any administration to treat them that way erodes our national security and flies in the face of Congress’ constitutional obligation to oversee matters of war and peace," he continued.</p><p>Warner said the partisan "stunt" is a "slap in the face" to Congress’ war powers responsibilities and to the men and women in uniform. He also stressed that it sets a "reckless and deeply troubling precedent."</p><p>Reports indicate that the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) produced a legal opinion justifying the strikes, which Democrats have been demanding in recent weeks.</p><p>"The administration must immediately provide to Democrats the same briefing and the OLC opinion justifying these strikes, as Secretary Rubio personally promised me that he would in a face-to-face meeting on Capitol Hill just last week," Warner said in his statement. "Americans deserve a government that fulfills its constitutional duties and treats decisions about the use of military force with the seriousness they demand."</p><p>The Pentagon, responding to Warner’s criticism, claimed that the "appropriate" committees were briefed on the strikes.</p><p>"The Department of War has briefed the appropriate committees of jurisdiction, including the Senate Intelligence committee, numerous times throughout the operations targeting narco-terrorists," Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said in a statement. "These have occurred on a bipartisan basis, and will continue as such."</p><p>On Wednesday, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee also penned a letter demanding to review the legal justification behind the series of boat strikes they say appear to violate several laws.</p><p>"Drug trafficking is a terrible crime that has had devastating impacts on American families and communities and should be prosecuted. Nonetheless, the President’s actions to hold alleged drug traffickers accountable must still conform with the law," the letter states.</p><p>The Trump administration has also been scrutinized over the strikes by members of his own party, including Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who raised concerns about killing people without due process and the possibility of killing innocent people.</p><p>Paul has cited Coast Guard statistics that show a significant percentage of boats boarded for suspicion of drug trafficking are innocent.</p><p>The senator has also argued that if the administration plans to engage in a war with Venezuela after it has targeted boats it claims are transporting drugs for the Venezuela-linked Tren de Aragua gang, it must seek a declaration of war from Congress. In the House, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., has made similar statements.</p><p>This comes as Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth announced the U.S. military on Wednesday struck another boat carrying people he said were narco-terrorists. The strikes were carried out in the Eastern Pacific region at the direction of President Donald Trump, killing four men on board.</p><p>That was the 14th strike on suspected drug boats carried out since September. A total of 61 have reportedly been killed while three survived, including at least two who were later repatriated to their home countries.</p><p>The Pentagon has not released the identities of those killed or evidence that drugs were on board.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Hannity town hall: GOP candidate reveals which far-left policy he will eliminate first as governor</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>In a televised town hall with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday, New Jersey Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli announced which far-left policy will be his day-one priority to eliminate if he is elected governor.</p><p>With just five days until Election Day, Ciattarelli trails his Democratic opponent, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, by seven points in deep blue New Jersey. Nonetheless, while speaking with Hannity in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, Ciattarelli maintained that his campaign holds the momentum to upset Sherrill and flip the state red.</p><p>If he should win the race, Ciattarelli told Hannity that his very first priority would be eliminating New Jersey’s sanctuary policies, keeping local and state authorities from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement operations.</p><p>"Executive order number one, on day one, no town in this state will be a sanctuary city, we will not be a sanctuary state," said Ciattarelli, as the crowd, filled with local New Jerseyans, broke into applause.</p><p>"Here’s the good news," he went on. "Many of the things that [current Democratic Gov. Phil] Murphy has done were by executive order. They weren’t codified by the legislature, which means I can reverse them on day one."</p><p>"Having sanctuary cities and us being a sanctuary state encourages illegal immigration, and it handcuffs our local police in certain ways; we’re not doing that. I'm going to reverse that on day one," he said, adding, "If a local police chief and mayor want to work together to preserve safety in our community by partnering with a federal agency, I’m not going to get in the way."</p><p>Ciattarelli also announced he would prioritize eliminating cashless bail, saying the policy "has created a professional criminal who’s learned how to game the system."</p><p>"Talk to your local cops and they’ll tell you about this dynamic known as ‘arrest, release, repeat,’ it's demoralizing for cops," he explained.</p><p>Despite having unsuccessfully run for New Jersey governor two times already, Ciattarelli told Hannity the early voting results have him in a "really good position to win."</p><p>During the town hall, he also knocked Sherrill for refusing to release her military records relating to the disciplinary action she faced for involvement in a cheating scandal at the U.S. Naval Academy. Sherrill has maintained that she did not cheat but was kept from walking with her graduating class for refusing to give up information on those who cheated.</p><p>"All she has to do is approve the release of her disciplinary records, and we’ll know why she was disciplined. And if what she is saying is true, her disciplinary records will confirm that, but she won’t release them," he said, adding, "There’s a pattern here."</p><p>He also dinged Sherrill over her endorsement from New York socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani.</p><p>"We’ve called on her to reject that endorsement, but she hasn’t," he said as Hannity noted, "Just like she’ll be the most transparent but never give out her naval records."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump urges GOP to ‘end the shutdown’ by going nuclear on Senate filibuster</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump on Thursday urged Republicans to end the filibuster in order to end the monthlong government shutdown.</p><p>In a late-night Truth Social post, Trump noted that Democrats had tried to eliminate the Senate procedure when they had control of both chambers of Congress and the White House during the Biden administration, but then-Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema — both of whom have since left the Democratic Party to become independents — helped block the effort.</p><p>Trump revived talk of the "nuclear option," after his returning from his Asia trip this week. </p><p>"The one question that kept coming up, however, was how did the DemocratsSHUT DOWN the United States of America, and why did the powerful Republicans allow them to do it?" Trump wrote. "The fact is, in flying back, I thought a great deal about that question, WHY?" </p><p>The president praised Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson for "doing a GREAT job," but blasted Democrats as "crazed lunatics" suffering from "Trump Derangement Syndrome." </p><p>"They want Trillions of Dollars to be taken from our Healthcare System and given to others, who are not deserving — People who have come into our Country illegally, many from prisons and mental institutions," Trump wrote. "This will hurt American citizens, and Republicans will not let it happen."</p><p>Republicans and Democrats remain at an impasse over how to end the shutdown, now in its fourth week, with both sides trading blame for the stalemate. </p><p>Trump added that Republicans, who now hold control of Congress and the White House, should play their "Trump card" and go for the "nuclear option."</p><p>"Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!" he wrote.</p><p>Trump added that Democrats "fought so hard" to end the filibuster under Biden but failed. Now, he argued, Republicans should abolish the procedure to advance their own agenda and end the shutdown. </p><p>"[I]f we did what we should be doing, it would immediately end this ridiculous, country-destroying shutdown," Trump said. </p><p>He added that Democrats would "do it on their first day" if they regained power. </p><p>"In addition to all of the other things we would get, such as the best Judges, the best U.S. Attorneys, the best of everything, this was a concept from years ago of then President Barack Hussein Obama and former Majority Leader Harry Reid in order to take advantage of the Republicans. Now I want to do it in order to take advantage of the Democrats," Trump added.</p><p>The president was referring to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's 2013 decision to eliminate the 60-vote threshold for most executive branch and judicial nominees. The Senate, with a Democrat majority, voted 52–48 in 2013 to eliminate the 60-vote requirement.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Jennifer Welch says JD Vance is secretly gay and was a failed drag queen</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Bravo star Jennifer Welch and "Pod Save America" host Tommy Vietor raged on the "I’ve Had It" podcast about being beaten politically by Republicans.</p><p>"I’ve had it with getting beaten by the biggest f------ losers on the planet," Vietor said on Thursday. He continued to rant about right-wing figures ranging from White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller to Don and Eric Trump, to the young Republicans whose controversial and offensive texts were exposed from a groupchat.</p><p>"I'm so tired of these losers beating us, and there being this perception that MAGA is cool and that that is the ascended part of the culture, and it is just wrong, and it's driving me crazy, and we can't let it happen anymore," he added.</p><p>"I couldn't agree more. I mean, I always say to pubs, I'm like, we cannot lose our democracy to these f------ dorks," Welch said. Earlier this month, she called Miller a "Nazi Jew."</p><p>"And then you get to JD Vance, who is a failed drag queen," Welch continued. "He is a failed drag queen. He wanted to be a drag queen. He couldn't do it. He wasn't fabulous enough. He goes off to Peter Thiel's gay boot camp in Silicon Valley and he comes out like a sociopathic queer-eyed freakshow. You know, he'd be so much cooler if he'd just come out."</p><p>The podcast host, who frequently condemns Trump supporters, argued that there is a specific phenomenon of Republicans doing far-right, Christian policies in order to compensate for living a secret gay lifestyle that they are ashamed of.</p><p>"I have this whole theory, Tommy, that in the MAGA movement, there's a group of DL demon queens," Welch said. "And I think that a lot of them are mad that they can't come out and feel pride. And so they browbeat everybody all day long, and then they get on Grindr at night, and then they go do gay stuff and they wake up. But I think they think like the Mike Johnson of it all, he's such a nut evangelical. I think he thinks, ‘Okay, I can't stop doing gay stuff, but if I make America Christian nationalists, then I'm going to curry favor with God.’ I grew up in a red state around all these evangelicals, and they think s--- like this. </p><p>"You're so right about the repressed," Vietor said. "There's so many people who are repressing something and then acting out in a way that is evil and cruel towards the part of themselves that they hate. You just see that over and over and over again."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Peter Thiel, JD Vance, and Mike Johnson, and did not receive immediate reply.</p><p>Far-left podcast star Jennifer Welch has become a liberal media darling as her recent commentary has generated intense backlash from the right.</p><p>Welch has made numerous appearances on CNN and MSNBC while also hosting top Democratic leaders like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Federal investigators are reportedly searching for answers after more than 300 piles of cremated human remains were discovered in the desert near Las Vegas.</p><p>The discovery was first reported after a local man stumbled upon the remains in July outside Searchlight, Nevada, nearly an hour south of Vegas, KLAS reported.</p><p>By August, officials from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had confirmed that the piles were human.</p><p>The remains, pulverized bone fragments known as "cremains," were said to have been found spread across a desolate stretch of land on the outskirts of the city.</p><p>On Wednesday, crews from Palm Mortuaries and Cemeteries removed approximately 315 piles of the cremains from the site, KLAS reported.</p><p>Celena DiLullo, president of Palm Mortuaries and Cemeteries, explained how the remains would be transferred to a cemetery crypt.</p><p>"I think it’s important to us to make sure that these people are not forgotten and not left," DiLullo told the news station. "It’s important to our community and our profession that we demonstrate how much we care about these people."</p><p>While the BLM and Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department reportedly continue to investigate, the origins of the remains aren't clear.</p><p>Early reports suggested that the ashes may have been dumped by a commercial funeral home business.</p><p>Under Nevada law, people are allowed to scatter ashes on public land, and there is no prohibition against the scattering of cremated remains in general.

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former wide receiver and current NFL analyst Steve Smith Sr. delivered a harsh critique of second-year Buffalo Bills wide receiver Keon Coleman. </p><p>During the latest edition of the "89 with Steve Smith Sr" podcast, the former Carolina Panthers star offered a scathing critique of Coleman. </p><p>Smith's comments centered on Coleman’s drop in production this season and his apparent inability to "get separation" from defenders.</p><p>"Well, the short version: nothing," Smith said. "I haven’t seen anything from him because he hasn’t had the opportunities, because opportunities don’t make themselves available. He just doesn’t get open fast enough. Now, Josh Allen looks his way… When it’s press coverage, Josh looks over there, but Josh gets off of him very fast. And some people, like they do, jump in the comments and say, ‘Well, he was open on this play, but Josh got off of him.’ That means he’s taking too long. That means the quarterback doesn’t have confidence in your ability to get there."</p><p>Coleman was targeted 57 times in the 13 games he played during the 2024 season, finishing the year with 556 receiving yards. He has 267 receiving yards on 27 targets so far in 2025. Smith and his co-host, James Palmer, highlighted the drop in passes thrown to Coleman since Week 1 of the 2025 season.</p><p>Coleman had eight receptions in the first game of the season, but has hauled in just 19 passes in the ensuing weeks.</p><p>Coleman had eight receptions in the first game of the season but has hauled in just 19 passes in the ensuing weeks. Coleman is listed at 6 feet 4 inches, while Smith was listed at 5 feet 9 inches during his NFL career. Despite the height difference, Smith made it clear he stands firm in his doubts about Coleman’s ability to become a top option in the Bills’ passing game.</p><p>"And you remember, I get accused of people who are taller than 6-feet, ‘Oh, Steve, you’re jealous,’" Smith continued. "My man, out of 12 contested targets, he got four. That is less than 30 cents. The five stick of gum is 35 cents right now…. When you got halitosis, those five sticks of gum can help and improve and higher your percentage of not walking out the club lonely, and he ain’t got a chance."</p><p>"He doesn’t have the ability to be a true No. 1, and he’s not," Smith said.

<div class="article-title">'Days of Our Lives' star Suzanne Rogers diagnosed with Stage II colorectal cancer</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Soap opera actress Suzanne Rogers revealed this week that she has been diagnosed with cancer.</p><p>The "Days of Our Lives" actress, who has played Maggie Horton on the show for 52 years, told TV Insider that she was diagnosed with Stage II colorectal cancer after she felt something "wasn't quite right."</p><p>The 82-year-old said that she regularly gets colonoscopies, but her doctor ordered another one.</p><p>"He said, ‘I want you to have an MRI and I want you to have a PET scan and I’m going to do a biopsy,’" she said her doctor told her. "And the minute he said that I knew that it was something more."</p><p>She said after she went in for another procedure, her doctor told her: "'You have cancer and you have to start treatment.' It was all a shock. I mean, I think I was in a shock for several days because I take pretty good care of myself. But he said, 'It’s a good thing you caught it in time.'"</p><p>She began treatment three days after wrapping the season of "Days of Our Lives" in June.</p><p>"It was radiation every day and chemo every day for six weeks, and it was tough," she admitted. "It was tough knowing you had to do it five days a week, and then you had off Saturday and Sunday. I thoroughly enjoyed my weekends because I didn’t have to go to and see a doctor. I was so tired of seeing doctors."</p><p>Rogers said she was grateful for the show's six-week hiatus over the summer because she didn't have to go public with her diagnosis while she was undergoing treatment.</p><p>"I was able to keep it under wraps and then the show took that break, so it wasn’t necessary to get into it all then," she said. "It helped me because it gave me even more time to chill and to get myself healthy."</p><p>The show shoots 10 months ahead of when it airs, meaning that Rogers will be missing from some episodes next year.</p><p>"My sister, who checks in with me two or three times a day, said there’s been some things on Facebook that said that I had retired and I had left the show, and none of that is true. I don’t want to upset anybody, but I want them to know what’s going on."</p><p>Rogers' onscreen daughter, Linsey Godfrey, who plays Sarah Horton, would sometimes accompany her to the hospital because Rogers doesn't have family in Los Angeles.</p><p>"I had to have an infusion, and it takes about an hour and a half, so Linsey sat there with me and held my hand while I was having it," she said. "We would go out to lunch or dinner with [fellow "Days of Our Lives" actor] Paul Telfer and Linsey’s daughter, Aleda. I knew I could count on them, so it was a lovely experience on and off the set. We really feel like a family."</p><p>She added that no one else on the show knew about her diagnosis.</p><p>"Nobody knew and then Linsey said, ‘Look, can I tell a few people, just to give you a call and say hi so you don’t feel like you’re so alone?'" she said. "Mary Beth [Evans] called. Stephen [Nichols] called me, and it was so lovely to get a call from him. And Greg Rikaart stayed in touch, as did AnnaLynne [McCord] and my makeup person at the show."</p><p>She said the producers also told her to take care of herself and that her role would be there for her when she was healthy enough to return.</p><p>Rogers completed her treatments at the end of July.</p><p>"I’m feeling really good," she told TV Insider. "I start back to work next week, so we’ll see how that goes. Now, I’m feeling anxious like I do any time I get scripts because I want to do my very best and you don’t want to hold up anybody. So that’s the only anxiousness I feel. It’s not because of my illness, let’s put it that way."</p><p>She said the biggest thing she's struggled with in her recovery is tiredness.</p><p>"I have a lot of energy all the time, so it really kind of shook me thinking, ‘Am I going to get my energy back?’" she said. "And it seems like it’s coming back. It’s not 100% yet, but I feel better. Today I feel really good, and that’s happening more and more than the other way around, so I’m really happy about that."</p><p>Rogers also noted that she didn't lose her hair during her treatments because she was taking chemo pills.</p><p>"I’m sure there’ll be people that are saying, ‘Well, she didn’t really have cancer,’ but you know what? I really don’t care what people say," she admitted. "I know what I’ve gone through and I’ve come out on the other side, so that’s all I care about."</p><p>She said her ordeal has helped give her perspective.</p><p>"It’s so funny because I used to worry about some silly things, and when you go through this, it kind of takes you a while to say, ‘OK, well, this is what I have, and I will do my very best to fight it and to get through it,'" she said. "And that’s what I did. The prayers and the good wishes from my friends and my family helped me stay positive and stay on top of it and beat this."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Shutdown seen from the pulpit: Inching along on a wing and a prayer</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Every time there’s a government shutdown, I turn to an unconventional barometer to understand the depth of the impasse.</p><p>I always observe the first few moments of the Senate session.</p><p>Logical, right?</p><p>Any congressional reporter worth their salt would surely want to hear the musings of the Senate majority and minority leaders on the floor to digest where things stand with the shutdown.</p><p>But I tune in to hear someone who has their palm on the pulse of the Senate. They might not rank as high as Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. But they have a direct line to someone who outranks everyone.</p><p>I listen to the Senate’s opening prayer from Senate Chaplain Barry Black.</p><p>"On this third day of the government shutdown, inspire them to work for your glory in all they think, say and do," Black prayed as he opened the Senate Oct. 3. "Equip our senators for their task."</p><p>Black is a parliamentary pastor offering ecumenical intercessions in search of a shutdown solution.</p><p>The shutdown impasse deepened since Black’s initial invocation more than three weeks ago. But after days of political posturing and inaction by the Congressional laity, Black unloaded on his Senate flock Monday.</p><p>"When our children and grandchildren want to know what we were doing in the 119th Congress during the famous shutdown, may we not have to give these answers: ‘I helped set a new record for keeping the government closed. I failed to appeal to the better angels of my nature. I forgot Matthew 7:12, which states, do to others whatever you would like them to do to you,’" Black prayed.</p><p>"Lord, remind our lawmakers that no gold medals are given for breaking shutdown records. But a crown of righteousness is given to those who take care of the lost, last and least."</p><p>Black’s sizzling sermons from the Senate pulpit are canon during times of crisis. He delivered similar prayers during the lengthy government shutdowns of 2013 and 2018-19.</p><p>"Enough is enough," Black prayed during the 2013 shutdown after death payments to the families of deceased U.S. soldiers ceased. "Cover our shame with the robe of your righteousness."</p><p>After U.S. Capitol Police officers were injured following a high-speed chase and shooting at the Capitol — all while not being paid in the middle of that shutdown — Black chastised lawmakers in his prayer.</p><p>"Deliver us from the hypocrisy of attempting to sound reasonable while being unreasonable," prayed Black.</p><p>Black says his prayers are to God. But his position in the Senate grants him special status. Not every pastor enjoys the benefit (or pressure) of a 100-senator audience. That’s to say nothing of those watching across the country on C-Span.</p><p>Black was direct in his oration Tuesday.</p><p>"Lord, use our legislators to help end this government shutdown, increase their faith, hope, and love, enabling them to transform cacophony into concord," he prayed.</p><p>By day 29 of the government shutdown, it was unclear if Black’s petitions were getting through to lawmakers. Tensions rose in the Capitol as members lashed out at one another in fits of anger.</p><p>"Self-serving, nasty, vicious bull!" yelled Schumer, casting aspersions at the president, calling him "a cold, heartless individual."</p><p>Lawmakers sprinkled salty language into their rhetoric.</p><p>"We need five Democrat senators to pull their heads out of their asses," implored House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast, R-Fla.</p><p>"I’ve got the damn statute," bellowed Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. She demanded the Trump Administration release a contingency fund to pay for SNAP benefits.</p><p>"The money is there. Go get it, godd---it," DeLauro fumed.</p><p>The usually genial Thune excoriated Democrats during a heated floor exchange on SNAP.</p><p>"This isn't a political game! These are real people's lives that we're talking about!" thundered Thune. "And you all have just figured out that 29 days in there might be some consequences? That there’s people running out of money?"</p><p>That said — or yelled — Thune has long told Democrats he’s willing to engage them on their healthcare demands.</p><p>But with a caveat.</p><p>"You want to have discussion about healthcare? Open the government. Let’s do it," said Thune.</p><p>At least one Democrat is willing to take that offer.</p><p>"I think what's a very fair deal is open the government and let's just vote on extending these premiums for a year or more," Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., said on Fox.</p><p>But Democrats insist they’re not caving.</p><p>"There are zero cracks on the Democratic side," said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.</p><p>Jeffries blasted President Trump for refusing to negotiate to end the shutdown — while the president was in Asia.</p><p>"Donald Trump has spent more time talking to Hamas and the Chinese Communist Party than he has in talking to Democrats on Capitol Hill to end the Trump shutdown," the New York Democrat said.</p><p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is exasperated with the Democratic brass.</p><p>"I've given up on the leadership," said Johnson. "So, we're trying to appeal to a handful of moderates or centrists who care more about the American people."</p><p>Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., is one of three senators associated with the Democrats who voted repeatedly to fund the government. There is chatter about what it will take to halt the shutdown. But the talks are informal.</p><p>"I think that there's an opportunity for us to come together, to open up the government, to address the looming health care crisis," Cortez Masto told Chase Williams of Fox Business. </p><p>"There is the will among senators on both sides of the aisle to do something. But the leadership's getting in the way. And the one person that needs to be at the table is not. That’s Donald Trump. Because Speaker Johnson and Leader Thune will not do one thing unless he says and tells them what to do."</p><p>Multiple lawmakers are forecasting what will compel lawmakers to reopen the government.</p><p>"I think Veterans Day is probably D-Day," said Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio. "And that's when you're going to break the system."</p><p>"I think it's going to happen next week," predicted Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.</p><p>"Why?" yours truly asked.</p><p>"Just because the carnage is piling up, and Democrats are getting hurt more than they're being helped," replied Graham.</p><p>It’s unclear if that compels lawmakers to reopen the government. There’s now pressure in the air — and on the ground — to reopen the government. Multiple airlines and the Teamsters demanded that Congress pass the GOP’s bill to fund the government.</p><p>To Graham’s point, next week represents the shutdown’s most significant inflection point yet, which could potentially <i>force</i> lawmakers to come around. SNAP benefits running out. A second missed paycheck. Worry about the airlines. It’s an "opportunity." But only that. Those "opportunities" will soon multiply.</p><p>Barry Black will likely continue his daily invocations to end the shutdown. And only the Almighty knows when the shutdown will end.</p><p>But, until then, operations of the federal government are limping along.</p><p>On a wing. And a prayer.</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Longtime CBS star Gayle King is reportedly leaving "CBS Mornings," marking the latest shakeup at the Tiffany Network. </p><p>Variety reported Thursday that King is expected to step down as co-host of CBS' marquee morning program next year after more than a decade, citing four sources familiar with the plan. </p><p>However, Variety suggests that although her contract expires in May, King may remain with CBS News and produce content for the network, resembling Norah O'Donnell's arrangement when she stepped down as the anchor of "CBS Evening News" earlier this year. </p><p>"There have been no discussions with Gayle about her contract that runs through May 2026. She’s a truly valued part of CBS, and we look forward to engaging with her about the future," a spokesperson for CBS News told Variety. </p><p>Neither CBS News nor Paramount immediately responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comment. </p><p>King joined CBS News in 2012 and was part of the network's morning show relaunch, then called "CBS This Morning." While other co-hosts rotated in and out of the program over the years, King kept her seat.

<div class="article-title">Trump-backed Ciattarelli tells Hannity early voting surge puts his campaign in 'really good position'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>POINT PLEASANT, N.J. - With six days to go until Election Day and one of only two races for governor in the nation this year careening towards a potential tight finish, New Jersey Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli is highlighting the state's robust early voting numbers.</p><p>"We’ve seen more Republicans return vote by mail ballots than ever before," Ciattarelli said Thursday during a town hall on Fox News' "Hannity."</p><p>The town hall, hosted by Fox News' Sean Hannity in this seaside community along the Jersey Shore, took place six days into state's early in-person voting period. Nearly one million voters have already cast a ballot, either in-person or through mail-in voting, far ahead of the pace four years ago when Ciattarelli came close to upsetting Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.</p><p>Now, in his third bid for Garden State governor, Ciattarelli is facing off with Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill in an extremely competitive and combustible race to succeed the term-limited Murphy.</p><p>"The return rate’s been phenomenal. And here through the first five or six days of early voting, which goes through Sunday, we’ve been matching them voter for voter. That puts us in a really good position to win," Ciattarelli said.</p><p>But Sherrill, a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who flew helicopters during her military career and briefly served as a federal prosecutor before first winning election to Congress in 2018, is also touting the early voting numbers, calling them "really great news."</p><p>"We’re seeing such great results in the vote by mails and the early voting," she told Fox News Digital on Wednesday after a meet and greet at a senior center in Elizabeth, New Jersey. "Certainly the trend is much better than ’21."</p><p>Ciattarelli, a one-time certified public accountant who started a medical publishing company before getting into politics and winning election as a state lawmaker, landed President Donald Trump's endorsement earlier this year, in the closing stretch of the GOP gubernatorial nomination race. Trump's backing helped Ciattarelli cruise to an easy and convincing primary victory in a nomination race that centered on support for the president.</p><p>Ciattarelli was joined on the campaign trail the past two weeks by two top MAGA stars and leading allies of President Donald Trump allies - former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy of Ohio and Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida.</p><p>Trump headlined a tele-rally for Ciattarelli last Friday, on the eve of the start of early voting, and his campaign told Fox News Digital that another tele-rally with the president is expected before Election Day.</p><p>In a likely close election where getting base voters to the polls will be crucial, the hope is that the tele-rallies with the president, and the recent campaign trail stops by Ramaswamy and Donalds will energize MAGA supporters, many of whom are low-propensity voters who often skip casting ballots in non-presidential election years.</p><p>"We go after those one out of four Republicans …who typically only vote in presidential years," Ciattarelli said during the Hannity town hall. "We’ve done a magnificent job, our local Republican organizations have, in getting those people to vote by mail or vote early."</p><p>While Democrats have long dominated federal and state legislative elections in blue-leaning New Jersey, Republicans are very competitive in gubernatorial contests, winning five out of the past 10 elections.</p><p>While Democrats still have a large voter registration advantage over Republicans in New Jersey, the GOP has narrowed the gap in the four years since Ciattarelli fell short of victory.</p><p>And Trump made major gains in New Jersey in last year's presidential election, losing the state by only six percentage points, a vast improvement over his 16-point deficit four years earlier.</p><p>Ciattarelli, pointing to Trump's 2024 finish in New Jersey, said "that improvement means there’s 300,000 more people today that are favorable to the president than back in 2021."</p><p>Ciattarelli was not only predicting a win at the top of the ticket, he was also forecasting down-ballot victories for the GOP in the state legislature, which the Democrats have controlled for nearly a quarter-century.</p><p>Noting that the GOP flipped eight seats in 2021 "with the wind at my face," Ciattarelli predicted that "with the wind at my back this time around I can flip 13 seats and that gives us a Republican majority for the first time in close to three decades."</p><p>The town hall took place as three new public opinion polls released on Thursday pointed to a single digit contest, with Sherrill holding the advantage.</p><p>A Fox News poll conducted last Friday through Tuesday (Oct. 24–28) indicated Sherrill leading Ciattarelli 52%-45% among likely voters in New Jersey. A Quinnipiac University survey suggested Sherrill up by nine points, while a Suffolk University poll indicated Ciattarelli trailing by just four points.</p><p>But other recent surveys indicated an even tighter contest between Sherrill and Ciattarelli.</p><p>New Jersey traditionally elects a governor from the party out of power in the White House, which this year favors the Democrats.</p><p>But Garden State voters haven't elected a governor from the same party in three straight elections in over a half century, which would favor the Republicans.</p><p>One of those political trends will be busted in next month's election.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>More than a thousand historic artifacts, including Native American baskets, jewelry and other priceless pieces, were stolen in a brazen overnight heist at an Oakland Museum of California storage facility, sparking a joint investigation by the FBI and Oakland Police Department.</p><p>The burglary happened just before 3:30 a.m. Oct. 15, 2025, when thieves broke into the museum’s off-site storage facility and made off with more than 1,000 objects from the collection, the Oakland Police Department said.</p><p>Among the items stolen were Native American baskets, jewelry, laptops and other irreplaceable pieces of California’s cultural history.</p><p>The FBI’s Art Crime Team, a specialized unit of about 20 agents nationwide, is assisting in the investigation. The team focuses on cases involving art theft, forgery, fraud and cultural property trafficking.</p><p>"This theft represents a brazen act that robs the public of our state’s cultural heritage," Lori Fogarty, executive director and CEO of the Oakland Museum of California said. "Most of these objects have been given to the museum by generous donors. We are working in close partnership with the City of Oakland, the Oakland Police Department and the FBI to see that these objects are returned."</p><p>Fogarty said the museum is working to complete an inventory of the stolen items and determine their total value.

President Trump just put a candy bar on some kid's head dressed as a marshmallow at the White House Halloween Party and made him balance it while waddling off," added one of Johnson's producers, Danny De Urbina.

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A South Florida elected official is pledging to donate his salary to the family of a fallen police officer who died in a fatal crash this week and left behind a wife and three young children. </p><p>Miami Beach Commissioner David Suarez told Fox News Digital he plans to reach out to the family of Miami Beach Police officer David Cajuso after giving them time to grieve. </p><p>Cajuso, 33, was a 10-year veteran of the police force who served as a motorman "with courage and an unwavering commitment to public service," the police department said in a Facebook post announcing his death. </p><p>"You couldn't find a better officer. He was really a cop's cop. He was one of the best," Suarez said. "He leaves behind a widow and three very small children. I'm married. I have three small children, and I can't image what my wife would do without me."</p><p>The fallen officer died after being involved in a traffic crash along the northbound lanes of Interstate 75 in the area of NW 138 Street.</p><p>Miami Beach commissioners make around $70,000 annually, a combination of base pay and monthly allowances, Suarez said. </p><p>Cajuso was remembered by residents as a good police officer with a warm smile who displayed the utmost professionalism.</p><p>"I recently spoke to him about the importance of supporting law enforcement and mutual friends we shared from my time in the FBI and those from Miami Beach Police Department," Nicole Parker, a former FBI special agent and Fox News contributor who lives in Miami Beach, told Fox News Digital. </p><p>"He genuinely cared about protecting others and particularly the most vulnerable, children.</p><p>"I was crushed to learn of his passing and even more heartbroken when I saw the photos of his beautiful family — a wife and three young children," she added.

"A lot of people forget that they have spouses, they have a lot of children. </p><p>"A lot of them are young, and I think it's important that we show the human side to the people who really protect us, because, in the last couple years, they've had a bad rap.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., criticized Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Thursday for not endorsing the Democrats’ New York City mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani.</p><p>Since he became the nominee, the Democratic Party has been embroiled in controversy over how to handle Mamdani’s rise due to his socialist policies and far-left views.</p><p>"Now, Hakeem Jeffries, your leader, has somewhat reluctantly, but has endorsed Zohran Mamdani, Chuck Schumer still has not. Why do you think Chuck Schumer has not endorsed Zohran Mamdani?" CNN host Kasie Hunt asked Omar.</p><p>"I really don‘t know. It makes no sense," Omar said. "We as Democrats have always believed that, in an election, we support our party‘s nominee. Schumer has pressured other Democrats to do just that, and he should be following his own advice."</p><p>When asked whether religion plays a role at all, Omar replied, "Well, the tsunami of the anti-Muslim attacks that we are seeing is deeply concerning. And I would hope that the Democratic leader in the Senate would recognize that and would offer support not just to Mamdani, but the million Muslims who live in New York City and the millions who live in New York and in America."</p><p>When asked about how some people found it potentially antisemitic for Mamdani to have been so slow to condemn the phrase "Globalize the intifada," Omar argued this accusation has been overused to the point of absurdity.</p><p>"Well, everything he does or says seems to be called antisemitic," Omar said as she scoffed. "What I do know is that he has support from a broad coalition of New Yorkers. He‘s got a huge coalition of Jewish voters that are supporting him. He‘s got a huge coalition of Muslims of every sect. </p><p>"He‘s got a huge coalition of young people who are supporting him. And the reason they are supporting him is not just because he‘s an exciting candidate to support. It's because he took the time to listen where the policy pains were for New Yorkers. And he‘s offering a solution for them. They see hope in the kind of progress that he could create for New Yorkers."</p><p>"One Democrat who has campaigned for and endorsed him is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Would you like to see her primary Chuck Schumer?" Hunt asked.  </p><p>"I would like Alex to do whatever it is that Alex wants, and I‘ll be there to support her," Omar replied.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Hurricane Melissa racing toward Bermuda vicinity. Maps show its forecast path.</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><span class="link">Hurricane Melissa</span> was bringing hurricane-force gusts to Bermuda overnight as it sped toward the British territory, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Melissa brought heavy rains and gusty winds to the Bahamas Thursday after hitting eastern Cuba and Jamaica. </p><p>A hurricane warning was in effect for Bermuda. </p><p>Melissa was <span class="link">one of the strongest hurricanes</span> ever recorded in the Atlantic basin when it reached Jamaica on Tuesday afternoon as a Category 5 storm. The 13th named storm of the Atlantic season didn't have any direct impact on the United States mainland.</p><h2>Melissa's forecast and path</h2><p>The storm's wind speeds dropped after its landfalls over Jamaica and Cuba to 100 mph, and its winds had weakened further to 90 mph when the hurricane center issued its 2 a.m. EDT advisory Friday. That put Melissa in Category 1, the lowest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.</p><p>The NHC said Melissa's core was about 150 miles north-northwest of Bermuda and it was hurrying northeast at 40 mph.</p>
<p>"On the forecast track," the agency said, "the center of Melissa is expected to move away from Bermuda this morning and pass south of the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland (Canada) as a post-tropical cyclone tonight. ... Gradual weakening is expected during the next couple of days, and Melissa is expected to become a post-tropical low by tonight."</p>
<h2>Rainfall forecasts</h2><p>The hurricane center said Melissa's outer bands "may bring 1 to 2 inches of rain through early this morning. Coastal flooding from storm surge is possible in areas of onshore winds for Bermuda."</p><p>The center added that "swells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions of Hispaniola (the island shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti) , Cuba, the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and Bermuda during the next couple of days.</p><p>"These swells are expected to reach the coast of the Northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada today and persist into the weekend" and "are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions."</p><h2>Climate change has been fueling the storm</h2><p>Above-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures, made worse by <span class="link">climate change</span>, helped Melissa rapidly intensify into a major hurricane, according to climate scientists.  </p>
<p>"That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now — around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal," Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading in the U.K., told The Associated Press. "And it's not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm."</p><p>Stronger winds, heavier rainfall and higher sea level rise make storm surge more intense.</p><p>Preliminary data from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists monitoring the effects of climate change, suggests that climate change increased Melissa's wind speed by 10 mph. </p><p>"Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification," Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, told the AP.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump is calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats <span class="link">and reopen the federal government</span>.</p><p>"THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE 'NUCLEAR OPTION,' GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER," Trump posted Thursday night on his social media site, Truth Social.</p><p>The filibuster is a long-standing tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running. It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the Oct. 1 shutdown when the new fiscal year began.</p><p>Mr. Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a "great deal" of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday.</p><p>CBS News has reached out to Senate Majority Leader John Thune for comment. The Senate adjourned on Thursday and is not schedule to meet again until Monday. </p>
<p>Mr. Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, <span class="link">where he met</span> with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>The president declared the trip a success because of a trade truce with China and foreign investment planned for American industries, but he said one question kept coming up during his time there about why did "powerful Republicans allow" the Democrats to shut down parts of the government.</p><p>His call to end the filibuster came at a moment when certain senators and House Speaker Mike Johnson believed it was time for the government shutdown to come to an end. It's unclear if lawmakers will follow Mr. Trump's lead, rather than finding ways to negotiate with Democrats.</p><p>From coast to coast, fallout from a shuttered federal government is hitting home: Alaskans are stockpiling moose, caribou and fish for winter, <span class="link">even before SNAP food aid</span> is scheduled to shut off. Mainers are filling up their home-heating oil tanks, but waiting on the federal subsidies that are nowhere in sight.</p><p>Flights are being delayed with holiday travel around the corner. Workers are going without paychecks. And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>"People are stressing," said Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce.</p><p>"We are well past time to have this behind us."</p><p>While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, the shutdown is not expected to end before Saturday's deadline when Americans' deep food insecurity — one in eight people depend on the government to have enough to eat — could become starkly apparent if federal SNAP funds run dry.</p>

<div class="article-title">2 dead after being found in flooded basements as NYC sees record rainfall</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Thursday's rain led to deadly flooding in parts of New York City as it broke records and caused damage across the Tri-State Area.</p><p>There were reports of downed trees, impassable roadways and trouble on mass transit. </p><h2>Apparent storm-related deaths in Brooklyn, Upper Manhattan</h2><p>At least two apparent storm-related deaths were reported.</p><p>Firefighters responded to a call of someone trapped in a flooded basement in a home on Kingston Avenue near Midwood Street in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, around 4:30 p.m.</p><p>Police said FDNY divers went into the apartment and found a 39-year-old man. He was rushed to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. His identity has not yet been released.</p>
<p>A friend of the man who died told CBS News New York's Ali Bauman he was trying to rescue his dog in the basement when water rushed in.</p><p>"The most, like, genuine giving never asking for anything," the friend said.</p><p>Neighbors say the block quickly went underwater during the storm, as it tends to do lately during flash flooding.</p><p>"So maybe this is like a wakeup call. We're crying for help," neighbor Renee Philips said.</p>
<p>Around the same time in Washington Heights, police were sent to a building on West 175th Street and Broadway. Witnesses told officers a 43-year-old man had been found unconscious inside a flooded boiler room in the basement.</p>
<p>The man was pronounced dead at the scene. A cousin identified the victim as Juan Carlos Montoya Hernandez.</p><p>Residents said Hernandez had lived in the building for at least 10 years and stayed in a small room in the basement. One resident said he was loved by everyone and was kind and helpful.</p><p>The victim's cousin said he leaves behind five children.</p><p>The city did issue text messages and emails Thursday warning of flash flooding in parts of our area, urging people to move to higher ground. New Yorkers must enroll with Notify NYC to get these messages.</p><h2>Record rainfall hits parts of NYC</h2><p>It was a record-setting day for rainfall in parts of the city. The National Weather Service reported 1.85 inches in Central Park, breaking the previous daily rainfall record of 1.64 set in 1917. The NWS also reported 2.09 inches at LaGuardia Airport, shattering the previous mark of 1.18 inches set in 1955, and 1.99 inches at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, beating the previous record of 1.57 inches, also set in 1955.</p>
<p>The storm also caused lengthy delays at all three major airports, some issues on the rails, and thousands of power outages across the region.</p><p>Winds gusted as high as 53 mph at times, and are expected to come roaring back by late Friday morning. Gusts will range from 35-50 mph, and the threat of downed trees and powerlines  will be in place once again.</p>
<p>Click here for the latest watches and warnings from the First Alert Weather Team.</p><h2>Roads flood, trees downed across New York and New Jersey</h2><p>City Councilman Justin Brannan reported several intersections in Brooklyn inundated by storm water, citing the age of some of the sewers and them being clogged with debris.</p><p>Bay Ridge store owner Tina Jiang's husband spent hours in knee-deep water, clearing leaves from the gutter when the sewer backed up, but it wasn't enough to stop the water from flooding her basement and destroying the inventory at her discount store.</p><p>"I tried to call 911. Nobody answer. Probably is busy everywhere," she said. "Tonight, I cannot sleep the whole night. What can we do? Hopefully somebody can help."</p><p>"This afternoon's record-setting storm continues the recent pattern of short but wildly intense downpours that have become increasingly common in recent years. DEP teams continue to respond across the city to address flooding reports and assist with drainage efforts," a spokesperson for the city Department of Environmental Protection said in a statement.  </p>
<p>The New York City Parks Department said as of 4 p.m., it had received 147 reports of down trees. It is asking tree conditions be reported to 311. In cases of true emergency, New Yorkers should call 911.</p><p>Among those, trees were reported down in Hollis, Flushing and the Corona sections of Queens.

<div class="article-title">At least 28 dead as Hurricane Melissa leaves Jamaica, Haiti, Cuba reeling</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>People across the northern Caribbean are beginning to dig out from the destruction of <span class="link">Hurricane Melissa</span>, as deaths from the catastrophic storm climbed to at least 28 across Haiti, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, with Haiti reporting most of those fatalities. On Thursday, Melissa was moving away from the Bahamas and had turned toward Bermuda, where weather conditions were expected to "rapidly deteriorate" later in the day, according to the National Hurricane Center. </p><p>President Trump has directed the State Department "to mobilize support for affected communities" in Jamaica, the Bahamas, Cuba, Haiti, and Turks and Caicos in the aftermath of the hurricane, the department said in an announcement on Thursday. The announcement said it would also be monitoring the situation in Bermuda.</p><p>"The State Department is collaborating with UN agencies, NGOs, and host governments to deliver food, water, medical supplies, hygiene kits, temporary shelter, and search and rescue support," the announcement said. </p><p>In Jamaica, the rumble of large machinery, whine of chainsaws and chopping of machetes echoed throughout the southeast as government workers and residents began clearing roads in a push to reach isolated communities that <span class="link">sustained a direct hit from one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record</span>.</p><p>Stunned residents wandered about, some staring at their roofless homes and waterlogged belongings strewn around them.</p>
<p>Emergency relief flights began landing at Jamaica's main international airport, which reopened late Wednesday, as crews distributed water, food and other basic supplies. </p><p>"The devastation is enormous," Jamaican Transportation Minister Daryl Vaz said.</p><p>At a news conference Thursday morning, Vaz and other officials spoke about some of the lingering consequences of the hurricane for communities in Jamaica. </p><p>"There are people who still have not been able to make contact with their families, their loved ones, their friends, and road access is still impossible," Vaz told reporters, referencing isolated areas on the western side of the island that responders have not yet been able to reach. "So, you can imagine the deep, deep sense of worry that is widespread across Jamaica."</p>
<p>Some Jamaicans wondered where they would live. </p>
<p>"I am now homeless, but I have to be hopeful because I have life," said Sheryl Smith, who lost the roof of her home. </p><p>Authorities said they have found at least four bodies in southwest Jamaica. </p><p>Prime Minister Andrew Holness said up to 90% of roofs in the southwest coastal community of Black River were destroyed. </p><p>"Black River is what you would describe as ground zero," he said. "The people are still coming to grips with the destruction." </p><p>More than 25,000 people remained crowded into shelters across the western half of Jamaica, with 77% of the island without power.</p><p>Dana Morris Dixon, a minister of education and information, said at a Thursday news conference that military crews and government officials were still working to access some of the western areas hit hardest by the storm. They were able to visit a handful of places by helicopter on Wednesday, but at times could not physically get to all of the locations they wanted to reach because "sometimes the helicopter could not land due to the devastation," Dixon said.  </p><p>"The military is cutting their way on foot through blocked roads," the minister continued, adding that crews were in the middle of attempting to cut through an area covered with thick bamboo, a task they could not finish completely on Wednesday and resumed Thursday morning.</p>
<h2>Haiti hard hit   </h2><p>Melissa also unleashed catastrophic flooding in Haiti, where at least 23 people were reported killed and 13 others missing, mostly in the country's southern region. Another 17 people suffered injuries, officials said.</p><p>Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said Hurricane Melissa killed at least 20 people in Petit-Goâve, including 10 children. It also damaged more than 160 homes and destroyed 80 others. </p><p>Officials warned that 152 disabled people in Haiti's southern region required emergency food assistance. More than 11,600 people remained sheltered in Haiti because of the storm. </p>
<h2>Cuba cleanup begins  </h2><p>In Cuba, people began to clear blocked roads and highways with heavy equipment and even enlisted the help of the military, which rescued people trapped in isolated communities and at risk from landslides. </p><p>No fatalities were reported after the Civil Defense evacuated more than 735,000 people across eastern Cuba. They were slowly starting to return home.  </p><p>"We are cleaning the streets, clearing the way," said Yaima Almenares, a physical education teacher from the city of Santiago, as she and other neighbors swept branches and debris from sidewalks and avenues, cutting down fallen tree trunks and removing accumulated trash. </p><p>In the more rural areas outside the city of Santiago de Cuba, water remained accumulated in vulnerable homes on Wednesday night as residents returned from their shelters to save beds, mattresses, chairs, tables and fans they had elevated ahead of the storm. </p>
<p>A televised Civil Defense meeting chaired by President Miguel Díaz-Canel did not provide an official estimate of the damage. However, officials from the affected provinces — Santiago, Granma, Holguín, Guantánamo and Las Tunas — reported losses of roofs, power lines, fiber optic telecommunications cables, cut roads, isolated communities and losses of banana, cassava and coffee plantations. </p><p>Officials said the rain was beneficial for the reservoirs and for easing a severe drought in eastern Cuba. </p><p>Many communities were still without electricity, internet and telephone service due to downed transformers and power lines.</p><p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday in a statement that the State Department would issue a declaration of humanitarian assistance for Cuba and vowed to provide the country with that assistance "directly and via local partners who can most effectively deliver it to those in need."</p><p>"In the wake of Hurricane Melissa's devastation of eastern Cuba, the Trump Administration stands with the brave Cuban people who continue to struggle to meet basic needs," Rubio said in the statement. </p><p>When Melissa came ashore in Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane with top winds of 185 mph on Tuesday, it tied strength records for Atlantic hurricanes making landfall, both in wind speed and barometric pressure. It was still a Category 3 hurricane when it made landfall again in eastern Cuba early Wednesday.</p><h2>Melissa not done yet  </h2><p>A hurricane warning was in effect Thursday for Bermuda as Melissa began heading that way, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Bermuda was already experiencing tropical storm conditions as of late Thursday night. </p>
<p>Melissa was a Category 2 storm with maximum sustained winds near 100 mph. It was moving northeast at 38 mph, the center added.</p>
<p>On the forecast track, the center of Melissa "is expected to pass to the northwest of Bermuda tonight and pass south of the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland Friday night," the center said. "However, Melissa is expected to weaken later tonight and Friday and become a post-tropical low by Friday night."</p>

<div class="article-title">SNAP funding is set to lapse Saturday. Here's what to know.</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The prolonged U.S. <span class="link">government shutdown</span> is putting millions of Americans at risk of missing their November food stamp benefits, a vital lifeline for low-income households.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, said in a memo Sunday that <span class="link">no benefits will be issued on Nov. 1</span>, leaving the program's roughly 42 million beneficiaries uncertain about how they'll pay for groceries next month. </p><p>SNAP recipients receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. Many of those registered with the program are asking if they will still be able to use the remaining dollars on their cards once funding is suspended and if they'll receive their November benefits retroactively, should lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.</p><p>With just days to go before a potential suspension in SNAP funding, here's what to know.</p><h2>Will current SNAP benefits roll over to November?</h2><p>While SNAP benefits will not be disbursed as scheduled in November, program recipients <span class="link">can use existing funds on their EBT cards</span> to make purchases. If someone enrolled in the program hasn't spent all their October EBT dollars, for example, those benefits would roll over into November.</p>
<p>Some states are advising recipients to use their remaining food stamps wisely, given the stalemate over funding the federal government. </p><p>"If you have remaining balances from previous months, we encourage you to plan your shopping carefully and purchase essential food items when needed," Hawaii's Department of Human Services said on its website. </p><h2>Will SNAP recipients get paid retroactively for missed payments?</h2><p>The USDA hasn't indicated whether SNAP benefits would be paid retroactively once the government shutdown ends. </p><p>But social service experts who spoke with CBS News said they expect the USDA to pay the delayed November benefits once federal funding resumes. </p>
<p>"It is our understanding that SNAP benefits will be issued retroactively when the shutdown ends," said Lizbeth Ginsburg, a managing attorney in the welfare law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.</p><p>Federal rules governing the food-stamp program stipulate that SNAP recipients are entitled to their benefits, and that they should receive them if there's a disruption, said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research &amp; Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger.</p><p>"That's why many state agencies have done a very good job of saying, 'Your benefits will be delayed,' versus, 'You are not getting benefits,'" she told CBS News.</p><h2>Can states step in to fund SNAP? </h2><p>While SNAP is federally funded and overseen by the USDA, each state is responsible for administering the program to its residents.</p><p>Some states are taking action, with Democratic lawmakers urging Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to tap into an estimated $5 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits next month. On Tuesday, a coalition of officials from 25 states and the District of Columbia <span class="link">sued the Trump administration</span> over the suspension of benefits, arguing that it is unlawful. The lawsuit notes that this would mark the first delay in SNAP benefits in the program's history.</p> <p>In recent days, several states have pledged to step in to ensure SNAP recipients can afford food in November. Their approaches vary, with some states promising to dispatch troops to support food banks, while others are allocating funds for general hunger relief.</p><p>Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry signed an emergency declaration on Oct. 24 intended to fund SNAP benefits for people who rely on the program, while Vermont lawmakers on Oct. 29 approved a plan to cover its residents' food stamp benefits through Nov. 15. </p>
<p>Other states say they plan to ramp up support for local food banks by providing on-site personnel and additional funding. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said last week he would deploy National Guard troops to assist food bank operations and fast-track $80 million to keep the state's food banks stocked.</p><p>In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is providing $30 million in state funding to support 16 million meals. Roughly 3 million people in New York are on food stamps.</p><p>Other states that have announced actions to help SNAP recipients include Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington.</p> <p>Officials in these states are stepping in despite the USDA saying states lack the authority to cover benefits and won't be reimbursed.</p><p>"There is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed," the agency said in its memo.</p><p>Plata-Nino said that puts states in a difficult position, given their already limited reserves. It also diverts attention and funding from other priorities, she added.</p><p>"These are resources that could have gone to other places," she said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Here's what Trump says he and Xi agreed to in their meeting</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington </em>— President Trump called his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea Thursday "amazing," and said the two reached agreements on a number of items, including the resumption of U.S. soybean sales to China and a short-term deal for access to rare earth minerals. No documents formalizing the agreements have been released yet, however.</p><p>Mr. Trump also said he would trim fentanyl-related tariffs on China. These moves should ease tensions between the two superpowers for now, though the president did not mention any long-term deals had been reached. </p><p>Xi has not personally made public statements since the meeting. </p><h2>Tariff rates on imports from China</h2><p>Mr. Trump said he agreed to reduce tariffs on Chinese goods by 10%, which he said would bring the rate from 57% to 47%. The president told reporters he expects to sign an agreement on trade "pretty soon," although he also said he's likely to renegotiate it in future years. </p><p>The president said he's easing tariffs because China pledged to work with him on the deadly fentanyl crisis. China is the world's largest exporter of the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, which has been a longstanding complaint of the president. Levying 47% tariffs on Chinese imports would still mean China has one of the highest tariff rates. </p>
<p>Mr. Trump also said the additional <span class="link">100% tariffs</span> on imports from China, which he previously said would take effect Nov. 1, will not be implemented. </p><p>Xi and China have not said what they will do to curb fentanyl production. </p><h2>Rare-earth minerals</h2><p>Mr. Trump said Beijing would delay its recently announced export restrictions on rare-earth minerals for one year, a delay he expects to be routinely extended. Mr. Trump claimed the rare earth issue has been "settled." </p><p><span class="link">China produces</span> <span class="link">as much as 95%</span> of the world's rare earth magnets, according to energy research company Wood Mackenzie and they're used to make everything from semiconductor chips to missiles. </p>
<p>"We have a deal now," the president said aboard Air Force One on the way back from South Korea. "Every year we'll renegotiate the deal, but I think the deal will go on for a long time, long beyond the year. We'll negotiate at the end of a year. But all of the rare earth has been settled."</p><h2>China to resume buying U.S. soybeans </h2><p>Mr. Trump also announced on Truth Social that Xi authorized China to begin purchasing "massive amounts of soybeans" and other farm products from the U.S.</p><p>Soybeans have been a serious point of contention between the U.S. and China, after China, typically the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans, stopped buying them altogether as a rebuke of Mr. Trump's tariff regime.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business on Thursday that China has pledged to return to regular levels of soybean purchases each year for the next three years, and that China agreed to purchase 12 million metric tons of soybeans this season. </p><h2>No paper deal on TikTok </h2><p>Mr. Trump did not make any announcements about a finalized agreement to keep TikTok running in the U.S., although Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said they received Chinese approval of a deal to transfer ownership of the company, so it's no longer under the umbrella of a Chinese company. Still, Bessent said the matter would be resolved in the coming weeks or months. </p><p>"In Kuala Lumpur, we finalized the TikTok agreement in terms of getting Chinese approval," Bessent said on Fox Business. "And I would expect that that would go forward in the coming weeks and months, and we'll finally see a resolution to that."</p><p>On Sunday, Bessent told "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" that the administration was close to a deal to separate TikTok from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, and that Mr. Trump and Xi would sign something Thursday. No announcement on this came after the meeting, though.</p>
<p>CBS News has asked the Treasury Department for clarification on Bessent's remarks about securing Chinese approval. </p><p>"China will work with the U.S. to properly resolve issues related to TikTok," China's Commerce Ministry said after the meeting, the Associated Press reported. </p><p>Mr. Trump has repeatedly delayed enforcing a law Congress passed banning TikTok from operating in the U.S. as long as it's operating under its China-based parent company, and the <span class="link">Supreme Court upheld</span> that ban. </p><h2>On chips </h2><p>Mr. Trump said he and Xi "did discuss chips," and Xi would be "talking with Nvidia and others. Mr. Trump said he'd speak with Nvidia CEO Jensen Hugan, as China seeks to buy U.S.-made chips. </p><p>The president said whether China purchases chips from Nvidia is largely up to Nvidia and Beijing, after the U.S. imposed restrictions on China's purchase of U.S.-made chips, citing national security reasons. Chips could be used to promote China's military and artificial intelligence capabilities. </p><p>"I said that's going to be between you and Nvidia, but we're sort of the arbitrator and the referee," Mr. Trump said. </p>

<p><em>Key West, Florida</em> — Across the U.S., there are furious efforts to get aid into the Caribbean nation of Jamaica following the trail of destruction and devastation <span class="link">left by Hurricane Melissa</span>. </p><p>Tens of thousands remain in shelters, and about 490,000 homes and businesses were still without power as of Thursday, or about 72% of the island, according to Jamaican officials. <span class="link">More than 130 roads</span> remain blocked by debris.</p><p><span class="link">Melissa</span>, which made landfall as a Category 5 hurricane, was responsible for at least four deaths in Jamaica.</p><p>"I think the entire Jamaica is really broken because of what has happened," Jamaican Minister of Education, Skills, Youth and Information Dana Dixon said in a news conference Thursday.</p><p>In Key West, Florida, Project DYNAMO, a nonprofit group of military veterans with unique search and rescue experience, is bringing in supplies for Jamaicans and providing flights home for stranded Americans.</p>

<p>"As the storm was hitting, we didn't have immediate communication because the network was in and out," Ford said.</p><p>Michael Capponi, president of the Global Empowerment Mission, says Florida's close ties to the Caribbean has led to a wave of volunteers.</p><p>"We have the second-largest Jamaican diaspora community in south Florida," Capponi said.

<section class="content__body">
<p>The Justice Department is investigating whether donations to the national Black Lives Matter foundation were misused by the group's leadership in the wake of an influx of gifts during nationwide racial justice protests in the summer of 2020, according to a source familiar with the investigation. </p><p>The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation Inc., which is a separate entity from the Black Lives Matter protest movement, has long been accused by right-wing critics of not being transparent enough with how it spends its donations. Part of that criticism came when the group used more than $6 million to buy a house in Los Angeles.</p><p>The group defended the purchase in a 2022 post on its website, writing that the house "serves as a space for Black folks to share their gifts with the world and hone their craft as they see fit, under the conditions that work best for them and in a safe space free from systems of oppression that exist in various creative industries." </p><p>The national Black Lives Matter foundation raised more than $90 million in 2020, the organization disclosed in a 2020 report. The group had over $28 million in assets as of June 2024, according to recent financial disclosures.</p><p>It is unclear specifically when the investigation into Black Lives Matter was launched, but it is being run out of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, which handles cases in or near Los Angeles, the source said. </p>
<p>The Associated Press was first to report the existence of an investigation into the nonprofit foundation.</p><p>In a statement, Black Lives Matter said that it "is not a target of any federal criminal investigation."</p><p>"We remain committed to full transparency, accountability, and the responsible stewardship of resources dedicated to building a better future for Black communities," the group continued. </p><p>Spokespeople for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Carlos Gomez, a federal employee based in San Antonio, Texas, has been relying on a local food bank to feed his family during the <span class="link">government shutdown</span>.  </p><p>"I have a very large family, so it's getting kind of hard. Whether the government is shut down or not, bills need to get paid," Gomez said.</p><p>"I tell people, don't ever be ashamed to ask for help," he added.</p><p>Nearly a month into the shutdown, food banks across the country are already straining to meet rising demand from hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are furloughed or <span class="link">working without pay</span>. </p><p>Now, they are bracing for an even bigger surge.</p>
<p>More than one in eight Americans depend on food stamps from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, but <span class="link">those benefits are set to lapse</span> on Saturday, Nov. 1, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. <span class="link">SNAP recipients</span> receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card to buy groceries, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food.</p><p>The Community Table Food Bank in Arvada, Colorado, was so inundated with people on Thursday that it had to temporarily close. But not before Danielle Brann, a SNAP recipient, was able to get some essentials, including ham and crackers and cans of spaghetti sauce.</p><p>"The line started at 9 o'clock this morning and I don't remember ever seeing it this busy. I mean, they're turning people away. So it's more of a demand for sure," Brann said.</p><p>In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, the Loaves and Fishes Food Pantry also had to <span class="link">turn people away</span> on Tuesday, because food is leaving the shelves faster than it can be restocked. </p>
<p>"We're supposed to serve more people and want to do that, but we don't have as much food to put on the shelves," said the Rev.

<p>In the state of New York, where nearly 3 million people are at risk of losing their SNAP benefits, Gov.

<div class="article-title">Wine importer Bill DeBlasio explains London newspaper's mayoral mix-up</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A newspaper reporter in London thought they were reaching out to former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for an interview about Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. The person they actually contacted was Bill DeBlasio, a wine importer from Huntington, Long Island.</p><p>Instead of correcting the reporter's mistake, DeBlasio decided to have some fun.</p><h2>"I never said I was the mayor"</h2><p>It was DeBlasio's email address, bearing his full name, that got his opinion of Mamdani onto the pages of The Times of London.</p><p>A reporter reached out via email, and the wine importer light-heartedly obliged, sharing some criticisms of Mamdani.</p><p>"I never said I was the mayor. He sent it to 'Mr. de Blasio' and I replied as 'Bill DeBlasio,'" DeBlasio said. "I spelled my name properly, no small D, you know. The big D, you know. The way my grandparents told us we were supposed to spell our name."</p>
<p>The paper said they retracted the story "after discovering that our reporter had been misled by an individual falsely claiming to be the former New York mayor."</p><p>"I just can't believe that, you know, I hate to call them lazy, but, like, they didn't check, and he didn't address me as mayor," DeBlasio said. "It was a little bit of sloppy reporting, you know, obviously they didn't vet me out. I never thought it would make it that far."</p><h2>"It literally was a surreal feeling"</h2><p>The man truly surprised by the interview was de Blasio, <span class="link">a major Mamdani supporter</span>.</p><p>"This is what's so weird -- I have people still reaching out to me saying, 'Oh, I see you changed your mind.' I'm like, no, I never did. It literally was a surreal feeling," de Blasio said. "I'm looking at a headline. I'm looking at a quote. A newspaper I never spoke to, a journalist I never contacted."</p>
<p>DeBlasio said the mix-up is nothing new.</p><p>"It's been brutal having the same name as the ex-mayor, especially an unpopular one," DeBlasio said. "It's been entertaining. I think I've handled it with humor and had some fun with it over the years."</p><p>He says he's learned to play along.</p><p>"I've been to, like, charity golf outings, and it was a bunch of firemen and cops, and they were like, 'oh, longest drive, Bill DeBlasio,' and I've been booed. You know, they'd start booing," he said.</p><p>The former mayor and the wine importer actually once met at a Mets game.</p><p>"He says to me, he goes, 'So how bad is it having the same name as me?' And I said, 'Dude, you're f------ killing me,'" DeBlasio said. "And he paused for, like, a second, like he was taken aback, he didn't know what to say. And then he just looked at me and he put his hand on my shoulder. He goes, 'I'm so sorry.'"</p><p>But confusion has its perks.</p>
<p>"You could call any restaurant in Manhattan and say, I'm making a reservation for, you know, Bill DeBlasio. And sometimes they'd say to my wife, 'Are you calling from the mayor's office?' And my wife would just say, 'I'd rather not say,'" DeBlasio said. "A couple times, I had to show my driver's license to show that I was Bill DeBlasio."</p><p>DeBlasio points out he had the name first. The former mayor was born Warren Wilhelm Jr. and later changed it.</p>

<div class="article-title">5 arrested in case involving overdose death of Robert De Niro's grandson</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Five people have been federally charged in connection with the <span class="link">2023 overdose death of actor Robert De Niro's grandson</span> and two others, authorities said Thursday.</p><p>The five men, all in their 20s, are charged in connection with the the overdose deaths of three 19-year-olds in 2023, including Leandro De Niro-Rodriguez, Akira Stein, daughter of Blondie co-founder Chris Stein, and an unnamed victim, according to a news release from the Drug Enforcement Administration. </p><p>The five suspects were identified as Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver and brothers John Nicolas and Roy Nicolas. </p><p>They all face charges of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute fentanyl, para-fluorofentanyl and alprazolam, resulting in the deaths of De Niro-Rodriguez, Stein and the third victim. If convicted as charged, they face a minimum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. </p><p>Epperson was arrested Tuesday in Troy, New York, the DEA said, while McIver was arrested Tuesday in Houston, Texas. John Nicolas was arrested Saturday in Buffalo, New York, while Roy Nicolas was arrested Saturday in Valley Stream, New York. Barreto surrendered to authorities Wednesday in Manhattan. All five have made their initial court appearances. </p>
<p>De Niro-Rodriguez's mother Drena De Niro <span class="link">previously said he died</span> after being sold pills laced with fentanyl. The medical examiner ruled his death accidental, caused by mix of fentanyl, cocaine and other drugs.</p><p>"Defendants who distributed the drugs, who killed these young 19-year-olds knew that they were deadly," Clayton said.</p><p>Prosecutors allege the five people arrested used social media and encrypted messaging apps to sell thousands of counterfeit prescription opioid pills laced with fentanyl to teens and young adults.</p><p>"Drug trafficking organizations have weaponized social media in a way that allows them to expand their network, make more profits and, unfortunately, get more people addicted to their poison," Frank Tarentino, special agent in charge for the DEA's New York Division, said in a news conference Thursday.</p>
<p>One of the victims allegedly warned one of the five suspects arrested that the drugs they had sold her caused her to overdose, and  she told him "just warn customers in batch might be extra strong," according to federal court documents. She later died after another overdose, prosecutors said.</p><p>The second victim died of an overdose two weeks later, and De Niro-Rodriguez died of an overdose less than a month after that. </p><p>De Niro-Rodriguez and his mother appeared in the 2018 movies "A Star Is Born" and "Cabaret Maxime." He was also credited with an appearance in 2005's "The Collection."</p><h2>19 others accused of running drug network in Washington Square Park</h2><p>In addition, 19 other people were federally charged with running a drug distribution racket in New York City's Washington Square Park since 2020. The 19 charged have nicknames like "Scarface," "Butter," "Hollywood" and "Heavy," prosecutors said, and face charges of conspiracy to distribute narcotics resulting in death.</p><p>The indictment alleges they "maintained a year-round market for opioids and crack cocaine" in the park, adding the various defendants have been arrested more than 80 times for drug-related crimes and, when they were released, they returned to the park and kept selling drugs. </p><p>"The defendants are aware that their drugs cause overdoses," prosecutors wrote.</p><p>Pictures in the indictment reportedly show the scene after two people fatally overdosed on drugs containing fentanyl, allegedly sold to them from dealers in the Washington Square Park area.</p>
<p>The victims included an 18-year-old who had just arrived in the city two days after graduating from high school and a 43-year-old person experiencing homelessness who was found dead on a sidewalk.</p><p>Law enforcement officials say the investigation into the park took 16 months. They would not confirm whether or not more arrests could be coming. They would only say the investigation is ongoing.</p>

<div class="article-title">IDF identifies remains of 2 Israeli hostages handed over by Hamas</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Two more sets of remains belonging to deceased Israeli hostages who were held by Hamas in Gaza were returned to Israel on Thursday, Israel's Prime Minister's Office said. </p><p>The transfer came after a previous delay by Hamas in response to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accusing Hamas of violating the ceasefire and ordering "<span class="link">powerful strikes</span>" on Gaza earlier this week. </p><p>The flare-up in violence had sparked fears the U.S.-brokered <span class="link">peace deal</span> between Israel and Hamas could collapse, but on Tuesday, Israel said the ceasefire was back on.</p><p>In a statement, Netanyahu's office said a military ceremony would be held when the hostage remains were received in Israel. They would then be transferred to Israel's Health Ministry National Center of Forensic Medicine for identification.</p><p>The Israel Defense Forces later said the remains have been identified as Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, and that their families have been notified. Based on information and intelligence available, the IDF estimated that Cooper was murdered while in captivity in February 2024. He was 84 and leaves behind a wife, four children and 11 grandchildren. The IDF estimated that Baruch was killed in captivity on Dec. 8, 2023. He was 25 and leaves behind his parents and two siblings. </p>
<p>"The IDF expresses deep condolences to the families, continues to make every effort to return all the deceased hostages, and is prepared for the continued implementation of the agreement," it said on X. </p><p>The bodies of 17 Israeli hostages taken during the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack have now been returned to Israel since the start of the peace deal, leaving 11 remaining in Gaza.</p><p>Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas released all living Israeli hostages in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and wartime detainees. Israel pulled back its troops to a designated line within Gaza, halted its military offensive and increased aid into the territory.  </p><p>Hamas also agreed to hand over the remains of all 28 deceased hostages, but has since said it is unable to locate or retrieve some of the remains due to the destruction caused by the war in Gaza. </p>
<p>Israel said the strikes in Gaza this week were in retaliation for the shooting and killing of one of its soldiers in Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza. Hamas said its fighters had "no connection to the shooting incident in Rafah." </p><p>Netanyahu's order for the strikes also came after Hamas returned a set of remains that Israel said belonged to a hostage recovered earlier in the war. </p><p>More than 100 Palestinians were killed in the strikes, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health. </p><p>Speaking at a graduation ceremony for military commanders in southern Israel on Thursday, Netanyahu warned, "If Hamas continues to blatantly violate the ceasefire, it will experience powerful strikes, as it did the day before yesterday and yesterday." </p><p>He said Israel would "act as needed" to remove "immediate danger" to its forces.</p><p>"At the end of the day, Hamas will be disarmed and Gaza will be demilitarized. If foreign forces do this, all the better. And if they don't, we will do it," Netanyahu said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Nationwide penny shortage leaves retailers struggling to make change</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Businesses around the U.S. are desperate for pennies. </p><p>President Trump's decision to <span class="link">stop producing the penny</span> earlier this year is leaving some merchants short of the one-cent coin and struggling to give customers exact change. Unable to order fresh supplies of pennies, banks are also rationing them. </p><p>Some retailers are pulling out all the stops just to scrounge up some pennies. Pennsylvania-based grocery chain Giant Eagle is holding a one-day event this weekend where customers can exchange their pennies for gift cards worth double the value of the coins, <span class="link">CBS News Pittsburgh reports</span>. </p><p>Sheetz, a convenience store chain, is also running a promotion offering a free soda to customers who bring in 100 pennies. </p><p>Troy Richards, president and chief operations officer at Louisiana-based Guaranty Bank &amp; Trust Co., said he's had to scramble to have enough pennies on hand for his customers since August.</p>
<p>"We got an email announcement from the Federal Reserve that penny shipments would be curtailed. Little did we know that those shipments were already over for us," Richards said.</p><p>Richards said the $1,800 in pennies the bank had were gone in two weeks. His branches are keeping small amounts of pennies for customers who need to cash checks, but that's it.</p><p>The lack of pennies has also become a legal minefield for stores and retailers. In some states and cities, it is illegal to round up a transaction to the nearest nickel or dime because doing so would run afoul of laws that are supposed to place cash customers, as well as debit and credit card customers, on an equal playing field when it comes to item costs.</p><p>To avoid lawsuits, retailers are rounding down. While two or three cents may not seem like much, that extra change can add up over tens of thousands of transactions. A spokesman for Kwik Trip, the Midwest convenience store chain, said it has been rounding down every cash transaction to the nearest nickel. </p>
<p>That's expected to cost the company roughly $3 million this year. Some retailers are asking customers to give their change to local or affiliated charities at the cash register, in an effort to avoid pennies as well.</p><h2>Costs more than they're worth</h2><p>To be sure, retailers and banks aren't clamoring for pennies to stick around. Pennies, especially in bulk, are heavy and largely used to give customers change. </p><p>"We have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years. But this is not the way we wanted it to go," said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.</p><p>The penny, which dates from the early days of the U.S. Mint after its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth. One penny cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute in 2024, according to the U.S. Mint's 2024 annual report. </p><p>"Let's rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time," Mr. Trump wrote in a Feb. 9 post on his Truth Social social media platform. </p><p>The Treasury Department said in May that it was <span class="link">placing its last order</span> of copper-zinc planchets — the blank metal disks that are minted into coins. In June, the last pennies were minted, and by August those pennies were distributed to banks and armored vehicle service companies.</p><p>Despite their coppery look, pennies are mostly made of zinc, with their distinctive appearance coming from a copper overlay. Zinc's cost per metric ton is more than double what it was in 2000, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</p>
<h2>Piling up in jars</h2><p>The U.S. Mint issued 3.2 billion pennies in 2024, the last full year of production, more than double that of the second-most minted coin in the country: the quarter. But the problem with pennies is they are issued, given as change and rarely recirculated back into the economy. Americans store their pennies in jars or use them for decoration. This requires the Mint to produce significant sums of pennies each year.</p><p>The government is expected to save $56 million by not minting pennies, according to the Treasury Department. Despite losing money on the penny, the Mint is profitable for the U.S. government through its production of other circulating coins as well as coin proof and commemorative sets that appeal to numismatic collectors.</p><p>In 2024, the Mint made $182 million in seigniorage, which is its equivalent of profit.</p><p>Besides Americans' penny-hoarding habit, a logistical issue is also preventing pennies from circulating.</p><p>The distribution of coins is handled by the Federal Reserve system. Several companies, mostly armored carrier companies, operate coin terminals where banks can withdraw and deposit coins. Roughly a third of these 170 coin terminals are now closed to both penny deposits as well as penny withdrawals. </p><p>Bank lobbyists say these terminals being closed to penny deposits is exacerbating the penny shortage, because parts of the country that may have some surplus pennies are unable to get those pennies to parts of country with shortages.</p><p>"As a result of the U.S. Department of the Treasury's decision to end production of the penny, coin distribution locations accepting penny deposits and fulfilling orders will vary over time as (penny) inventory is depleted" a Federal Reserve spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment on whether they had any guidance for retailers or banks regarding the penny shortage, or the issues regarding penny circulation.</p><h2>"We don't want the penny back"</h2><p>The U.S. isn't the first country to transition away from small denomination coins or discontinue out-of-date coins. But in all of these cases, governments wound down the use of their out-of-date coins over a period of, often, years.</p><p>For example, Canada announced it would eliminate its one-cent coin in 2012, transitioning away from one-cent cash transactions starting in 2013 and is still redeeming and recycling one-cent coins a decade later. The "decimalization" process of converting British coins from farthings and shillings to a 100-pence-to-a-pound system took much of the 1960s and early 1970s.</p><p>The U.S. removed the penny from commerce abruptly, without any action by Congress or any regulatory guidance for banks, retailers or states. The retail and banking industries, rarely allies in Washington on policy matters related to point-of-sale, are demanding that Washington issue guidance or pass a law fixing the issues that are arising due to the shortage. </p><p>"We don't want the penny back. We just want some sort of clarity from the federal government on what to do, as this issue is only going to get worse," said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.</p>

<div class="article-title">Scientists say they've solved debate about origins of mysterious dinosaur</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Scientists have long puzzled over the origins of a mysterious dinosaur excavated in the 1940s: Was it a young T. rex or another type of dinosaur?</p><p>At first, researchers had only a tyrannosaur skull to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn't settle the controversy.</p><p>Now, a research team says new evidence resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton — first uncovered in Montana in 2006 — that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.</p><p>The discovery "rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator," said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University.</p><p>Growth rings within the bones found in Montana's Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature's skull and an adult T. rex's — changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses — were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty.</p>
<p>Signs pointed to a dinosaur that's a distant T. rex cousin known as Nanotyrannus lancensis, the researchers reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature, calling it a rival species. </p>
<p>"Nanotyrannus is a small-bodied predator designed for speed. It's very agile and has long powerful arms [that are] larger than those of the T. rex," Zanno told Nature.</p><p>There's now "more support and evidence than there ever has been" that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she's not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new.</p><h2>Case of mistaken identity  </h2><p>Other independent scientists also said the debate isn't over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College.</p>
<p>There are similarities between the shape of T. rex's skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps.</p><p>"I don't think this study settles everything," he said.</p><p>Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago — or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed.</p><p>"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus," Napoli told the Reuters news agency.</p><p>The new skeleton is dubbed "Dueling Dinosaurs" because it was found intertwined with the bones of a Triceratops, and is currently on display at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.</p><p>The study comes just days after new research suggested <span class="link">dinosaur populations were still thriving</span> in North America before the asteroid strike. The evidence came from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.</p><p>In June, scientists identified a smaller-bodied <span class="link">ancestor of the T. rex</span> that roamed the plains of Mongolia as a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Ohio dad shares infertility story to raise awareness about common condition</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>High school sweethearts Esther and Max Hackman wanted to start a family soon after they got married in 2023 – but after five months of negative pregnancy tests, they were concerned it would be more challenging than they initially thought.</p><p>Esther visited her doctor to determine if she had any issues that may be causing infertility, but she was cleared. So she turned to her husband, Max, asking him to take an at-home sperm test.</p><p>"I figured that it was a very small chance," Max told "CBS Mornings" in an interview airing on Thursday, adding that having fertility issues never crossed his mind.</p><h2>Breaking the stigma</h2><p>He was shocked to see a low score pop up. His physician, Dr. Scott Lundy, a urologist at the Cleveland Clinic who specializes in male infertility, later confirmed Max's count was 100 times lower than normal.</p><p>"I guess maybe it was just my pride. I would never think that that would happen to me," Max said.</p>
<p>While the news came as a surprise to Max, it's more common than most think. Male fertility issues contribute to nearly half of couples struggling to conceive, according to the National Institutes of Health. Some doctors say the stigma surrounding male infertility is exacerbating the problem.</p><p>"Society tells us a lot of inaccurate things about fertility, and it also has linked the idea of male infertility with masculinity. They're not the same," Dr. Lundy said. "And we really have to break that stigma because it's harming patients and it's harming couples."</p><h2>Causes of male infertility</h2><p>Aside from medical conditions men are born with or develop, there are other everyday factors men need to be aware of that could contribute to low sperm count – like exposure to heat, heavy metals, certain medications, obesity, marijuana and testosterone use, sexually transmitted infections and more, according to the Mayo Clinic.</p><p>The leading anatomic cause of male infertility is varicocele, a swelling of a set of veins above the testicle. The condition affects between 15% to 20% of men in the U.S. — roughly 1 in 5 men, the Mayo Clinic says on its website.</p>
<p>"[It] causes either pain in the testicles, like a dull achy pain, or it causes infertility, or it causes lower testosterone," Dr. Lundy explained.</p><p>Max had varicocele on both testicles, but Dr. Lundy was able to correct it surgically – and his sperm counts completely normalized. He recalls the relief he felt when he saw a message pop up from Dr. Lundy sharing "great news."</p><p>"I was crying immediately. And it was a really, really special thing," Max said.</p><p>Men who undergo a varicocele procedure, like Max, can see a significant improvement in sperm count and quality, the National Institutes of Health reports. It typically takes at least three months post-operation for the sperm to regenerate.</p><p>Shortly after Max's surgery, Esther got her first positive pregnancy test. She gave birth to their son Patrick in March 2025. The Hackmans realize how fortunate they are, though Max is still working through the emotional toll of his experience.</p><p>"I still feel that kind of, you know, kind of tinge of shame, and embarrassment. But I think I can kind of do the mental gymnastics to kind of reframe it," Max said. "But I think, you know, feeling the kind of pain and despair that I felt, I know that there are people out there feeling that exact same thing. And it kind of makes me feel like I didn't suffer in vain if I can kind of leverage my own experience to kind of help get the word out and help them know that they're not alone and that there is hope."</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump says Senate should scrap the filibuster to end the government shutdown</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats and reopen the federal government.</p> <p>"THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE 'NUCLEAR OPTION,' GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER," Trump posted Thursday night on his social media site, Truth Social.</p>
<p>The filibuster is a long-standing tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running. It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the Oct. 1 shutdown when the new fiscal year began.</p> <p>Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a "great deal" of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday.</p>
<p>Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, finishing his tour by meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.</p> <p>The president declared the trip a success because of a trade truce with China and foreign investment planned for American industries, but he said one question kept coming up during his time there about why did "powerful Republicans allow" the Democrats to shut down parts of the government.</p> <p>His call to end the filibuster came at a moment when certain senators and House Speaker Mike Johnson believed it was time for the government shutdown to come to an end. It's unclear if lawmakers will follow Trump's lead, rather than finding ways to negotiate with Democrats.</p>
<p>From coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of a shuttered federal government is hitting home: Alaskans are stockpiling moose, caribou and fish for winter, even before SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Mainers are filling up their home-heating oil tanks, but waiting on the federal subsidies that are nowhere in sight.</p> <p>Flights are being delayed with holiday travel around the corner. Workers are going without paychecks. And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>"People are stressing," said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce.</p> <p>"We are well past time to have this behind us."</p> <p>While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, the shutdown is not expected to end before Saturday's deadline when Americans' deep food insecurity — one in eight people depend on the government to have enough to eat — could become starkly apparent if federal SNAP funds run dry.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Money for military, but not food aid</h3> <p>The White House has moved money around to ensure the military is paid, but refuses to tap funds for food aid. In fact, Trump's "big, beautiful bill" signed into law this summer, delivered the most substantial cut ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, projected to result in some 2.4 million people off the program.</p>
<p>At the same time, many Americans who purchase their own health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces, with open enrollment also beginning Saturday, are experiencing sticker shock as premium prices jump.</p> <p>"We are holding food over the heads of poor people so that we can take away their health care," said Rev. Ryan Stoess, during a prayer with religious leaders at the U.S. Capitol.</p> <p>"God help us," he said, "when the cruelty is the point."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Deadlines shift to next week</h3> <p>The House remains closed down under Johnson for the past month. Senators are preparing to depart Thursday for the long weekend. Trump returns late Thursday after a whirlwind tour of Asia.</p> <p>That means the shutdown, in its 30th day, appears likely to stretch into another week if the filibuster remains. If the shutdown continues, it could become the longest in history, surpassing the 35-day lapse that ended in 2019, during Trump's first term, over his demands to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall.</p>
<p>The next inflection point comes after Tuesday's off-year elections — the New York City mayor's race, as well as elections in Virginia and New Jersey that will determine those states' governors. Many expect that once those winners and losers are declared, and the Democrats and Republicans assess their political standing with the voters, they might be ready to hunker down for a deal.</p> <p>"I hope that it frees people up to move forward with opening the government," said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.</p> <h3 class="edTag">GOP cut SNAP in Trump's big bill</h3> <p>The Republicans, who have majority control of Congress, find themselves in an unusual position, defending the furloughed federal workers and shuttered programs they have long sought to cut — including most recently with nearly $1 trillion in reductions in Trump's big tax breaks and spending bill.</p> <p>Medicaid, the health care program, and SNAP food aid, suffered sizable blows this summer, in part by imposing new work requirements. For SNAP recipients, many of whom were already required to work, the new requirements extend to older Americans up to age 64 and parents of older school-age children.</p> <p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans now "have the nerve" to suggest it's a political strategy to withhold food aid.</p> <p>"We are trying to lift up the quality of life for the American people," Jeffries of New York said about his party.</p> <p>"The American people understand that there's a Republican health care crisis," he said. "The American people understand Republicans enacted the largest cut to nutritional assistance in American history when they cut $186 billion from their one, big, ugly bill."</p> <p>During the summer debate over Trump's big bill, Johnson and other Republicans railed against what they characterized as lazy Americans, riding what the House speaker calls the "gravy train" of government benefits.</p> <p>The speaker spoke about able-bodied young men playing video games while receiving Medicaid health care benefits and insisted the new work requirements for the aid programs would weed out what they called "waste, fraud and abuse."</p>
<p>"What we're talking about, again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system," Johnson said in spring on CBS' "Face the Nation."</p> <p>"And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all," he said.</p> <p>What remains out of reach, for now, is any relief from the new health care prices, posted this week, that are expected to put insurance out of reach for many Americans when federal subsidies that help offset those costs are set to expire at the end of the year.</p> <p>Democrats have been holding out for negotiations with Trump and the Republicans to keep those subsidies in place. Republicans say they can address the issue later, once the government reopens.</p>

<p>SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Cuba — The rumble of large machinery, whine of chain saws and chopping of machetes echoed through communities across the northern Caribbean on Thursday as they dug out from the destruction of Hurricane Melissa and surveyed the damage left behind.</p>
<p>In Jamaica, government workers and residents began clearing roads in a push to reach dozens of isolated communities in the island's southeast that sustained a direct hit from one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record.</p> <p>Stunned residents wandered about, some staring at their roofless homes and waterlogged belongings strewn around them.</p> <p>"I don't have a house now," said Sylvester Guthrie, a resident of Lacovia in the southern parish of St. Elizabeth, as he held onto his bicycle, the only possession of value left after the storm.</p>
<p>Emergency relief flights began landing at Jamaica's main international airport, which reopened late Wednesday, as crews distributed water, medicine and other basic supplies. Helicopters dropped food as they thrummed above communities where the storm flattened homes, wiped out roads and destroyed bridges, cutting them off from assistance.</p>
<p>"The entire Jamaica is really broken because of what has happened," Education Minister Dana Morris Dixon said.</p> <p>Police said at least 14 people have died in Jamaica, and they expected the death toll to keep rising. In one isolated community, residents pleaded with officials to remove the body of one victim tangled in a tree.</p>
<p>More than 13,000 people remained crowded into shelters, with 72% of the island without power and only 35% of mobile phone sites in operation, officials said. People clutched cash as they formed long lines at the few gas stations and supermarkets open in affected areas.</p> <p>"We understand the frustration, we understand your anxiety, but we ask for your patience," said Daryl Vaz, Jamaica's telecommunications and energy minister.</p> <p>Water trucks have been mobilized to serve many of Jamaica's rural communities that are not connected to the government's utility system, Water Minister Matthew Samuda said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Slow recovery in Cuba</h3> <p>In Cuba, heavy equipment began to clear blocked roads and highways and the military helped rescue people trapped in isolated communities and at risk from landslides.</p>
<p>No deaths were reported after the Civil Defense evacuated more than 735,000 people across eastern Cuba ahead of the storm. Residents were slowly starting to return home Thursday.</p> <p>The town of El Cobre in the eastern province of Santiago de Cuba was one of the hardest hit. Home to some 7,000 people, it is also the site of the Basilica of Our Lady of Charity, the patron saint of Cuba who is deeply venerated by Catholics and practitioners of Santería, an Afro-Cuban religion.</p> <p>"We went through this very badly. So much wind, so much wind. Zinc roofs were torn off. Some houses completely collapsed. It was a disaster," said Odalys Ojeda, a 61-year-old retiree, as she looked up at the sky from her living room where the roof and other parts of the house were torn away.</p>
<p>Even the basilica wasn't spared.</p> <p>"Here at the sanctuary, the carpentry, stained glass and even the masonry suffered extensive damage," Father Rogelio Dean Puerta said.</p> <p>A televised Civil Defense meeting chaired by President Miguel Díaz-Canel did not provide an official estimate of the damage. However, officials from the affected provinces — Santiago, Granma, Holguín, Guantánamo, and Las Tunas — reported losses of roofs, power lines and fiber optic telecommunications cables, as well as roads cut off, isolating communities, and heavy losses in banana, cassava and coffee plantations.</p> <p>Many communities were still without electricity, internet and telephone service because of downed transformers and power lines.</p>
<p>In an unusual statement Thursday, the U.S. State Department said the United States was "ready to assist the Cuban people." A press release said the U.S. "is prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance directly and through local partners who can deliver it more effectively to those in need."</p> <p>The statement did not specify how the cooperation would be coordinated or whether contact had been made with the Cuban government, with which it maintains a bitter conflict that includes six decades of economic and financial sanctions.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Death and flooding in Haiti</h3> <p>Melissa also unleashed catastrophic flooding in Haiti, where at least 30 people were reported killed and 20 others were missing, mostly in the country's southern region. Some 15,000 people also remained in shelters.</p> <p>"It is a sad moment for the country," said Laurent Saint-Cyr, president of Haiti's transitional presidential council.</p> <p>He said officials expect the death toll to rise and noted that the government was mobilizing resources to search for people and provide emergency relief.</p> <p>Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said Hurricane Melissa killed at least 20 people, including 10 children, in Petit-Goâve, where more than 160 homes were damaged and 80 others destroyed.</p> <p>Steven Guadard said Melissa killed his entire family in Petit-Goâve, including four children ranging in age from 1-month to 8-years-old.</p> <p>Michelet Dégange, who has lived in Petit-Goâve for three years, said Melissa left him homeless.</p>
<p>"There is no place to rest the body; we are hungry," he said. "The authorities don't think about us. I haven't closed my eyes since the bad weather began."</p> <p>When Melissa came ashore in Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane with top winds of 185 mph (295 kph) on Tuesday, it tied strength records for Atlantic hurricanes making landfall, both in wind speed and barometric pressure.</p> <p>Melissa was a Category 2 storm with top sustained winds near 105 mph (165 kph) Thursday night and was moving northeast at 32 mph (51 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. The hurricane was centered about 260 miles (420 kilometers) west-southwest of Bermuda.</p> <p>Melissa brushed past the southeast Bahamas on Wednesday, forcing officials to evacuate 1,400 people ahead of the storm.</p> <p>Melissa was forecast to pass near or to the west of Bermuda late Thursday and may strengthen further before weakening Friday.</p> <p>Bermuda's international airport was to close Thursday evening and reopen Friday at noon, while all schools on the wealthy British territory were ordered closed.</p>

<div class="article-title">Why an interstellar comet has scientists excited</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>An ancient comet that entered our solar system this summer is offering a rare opportunity to learn more about distant planetary systems far beyond the reach of any spacecraft, researchers say.</p> <p>The comet is special both because it is interstellar — meaning it came from outside our solar system — and also because nickel vapor was detected in the gas surrounding the comet.</p> <p>This comet, called 3I/ATLAS, is only the third such interstellar object to enter our solar system in recorded history. Observing such a rare occurrence is "extremely valuable for us," because it's the only opportunity to look at this object before it moves out of our solar system, said Darryl Z. Seligman, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Michigan State University, who is coordinating international teams of scientists that are observing 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>Rohan Rahatgaonkar, a Ph.D. student at the Instituto de Astrofísica-Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, and Thomas Puzia, who led the team there that made the discovery, were among the authors of a new research paper describing the nickel vapor detection.</p>
<p>The findings are notable because the nickel<strong> </strong>gas surrounding 3I/ATLAS was detected at a huge distance from the sun (nearly four times Earth's distance from the sun) where temperatures are too cold for metals to normally vaporize, Rahatgaonkar told NPR in an interview.</p> <p>"It was pretty clear that it was nickel," Puzia said of the data. "So it was super, super exciting."</p> <p>Puzia cautions that there's still a lot of evidence collection and research to be done into what these findings could mean. But this study into 3I/ATLAS opens the door for new insights into the chemistry of objects and materials that originate far outside of our solar system and are likely billions of years old, he said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">The comet could be older than our solar system</h3> <p>3I/ATLAS was first confirmed on July 1 to be the third interstellar object known to have come into our solar system, in a sky survey by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</p>
<p>When Rahatgaonkar and another student, Baltasar Luco, were set to observe the comet through the Southern Astrophysical Research (or SOAR) Telescope in Chile, they were not looking for nickel vapors.</p>
<p>But over multiple days of observations with the Very Large Telescope in Chile and as 3I/ATLAS continued its journey closer to the sun, Rahatgaonkar and other researchers found that levels of nickel vapor continued to increase.</p> <p>They measured the nickel using a host of instruments including a spectrograph and by looking at characteristics of the light coming off the comet.</p> <p>Rahatgaonkar and Puzia also credit a team of researchers around the world, using telescopes and other instruments, for helping to observe and analyze data on the comet.</p> <p>The analysis of this object is far from over. As it continues its journey close to the sun, it will undergo thermodynamic changes which will cause reactions that could, hopefully, give scientists more clues about where 3I/ATLAS was formed, how it evolved, what it carries and many more potential answers, Puzia said.</p> <p>This particular interstellar comet "could be maybe older than our solar system," Rahatgaonkar said. The chemical signatures being emitted from 3I/ATLAS "reflect the ancient origin and its long journey through interstellar space."</p> <p>Rahatgaonkar, Puzia and Seligman emphasized how valuable interstellar objects are to understanding star systems outside of our own solar system. They offer chemical and physical details from those systems and where they formed, potentially billions of years ago.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">The federal government is still shut down. Here's what that means across the country</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The federal government shutdown has dragged into another week, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to ending it.</p> <p>Many federal workers have missed paychecks, including air traffic controllers, who are working unpaid. </p> <p>The impacts of the shutdown could soon get worse. That's because a number of federal programs are set to run out of money on Nov. 1. If that happens, tens of millions of people would lose federal food and nutrition benefits like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps.</p> <p>Also set to run out of funding are some Head Start programs, early-learning centers for low-income families, that serve more than 65,000 children nationwide. </p>
<p><em>Read more about how food banks are bracing for SNAP funding to lapse</em></p> <p>The Agriculture Department says it will reopen about 2,100 county offices despite the government shutdown to help farmers get access to $3 billion of aid. At the same time many American farmers say the Trump administration's trade policies have them on the brink.</p> <p>As the shutdown continues, here's the latest on what we know.</p> <p><em>Jump to state-specific impacts.</em></p>
<p><strong>Why did the federal government shut down?</strong></p> <p>A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans. </p> <p>Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the health care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.</p> <p>Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer.</p>
<p>NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock. That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when subscribers could see big premium increases unless the subsidies that have been helping people pay for coverage since 2021 are extended.</p>
<p><em>Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here.</em></p> <p><em>Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as </em><em>a health care showdown</em><em>.</em></p> <p><em>— </em><em>Selena Simmons-Duffin</em><em>, NPR</em></p> <p><strong>What about WIC and SNAP benefits</strong>?</p> <p>Of those at risk of losing food and nutrition aid if the shutdown continues into November, 7 million receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC.) Nearly 42 million who rely on SNAP are also expected to lose their benefits. Their debit-like cards were funded a month in advance through October, but the Trump administration has warned the program will run out of money Nov. 1. </p> <p>In a letter dated Oct. 10, the USDA told state agencies to hold off distributing November benefits "until further notice" because of insufficient funds. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has called on the agency to shift money from its contingency fund and other places to keep SNAP at least partially funded.</p> <p>As NPR's Stephen Fowler reports, a coalition of more than two dozen Democratic state leaders are suing the Trump administration over its decision to suspend federal food benefits during the government shutdown. A federal court decision in that case may come as soon as Thursday.</p> <p>WIC was initially slated to lose funding after only a couple weeks. The Trump administration shifted $300 million in tariff revenue to keep it afloat, but the National WIC Association says that emergency funding will only last through October. It's calling for an additional $300 million to keep WIC operating for a couple more weeks. Some states could step in to help fill the gap, depending on their resources.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Jennifer Ludden</em><em>, NPR</em></p> <p><em>Read more on the impact of this potential lapse across the country, here.</em><em> — and you can </em><em>read more here about how food banks are bracing for it</em> </p> <p><strong>What about Head Start?</strong></p> <p>Beginning Nov. 1, more than 65,000 children will be at risk of losing access to Head Start, the federal early-learning program for low-income families. That's because federal funding for individual Head Start programs cannot be disbursed while the government is shut down.</p>
<p>Among the states hit hardest by this Nov. 1 deadline: Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio.</p> <p>Nationally, Head Start serves roughly 750,000 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, providing not just childcare and early learning but also free meals, health screenings and family support.</p> <p>Local Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. Some programs get their money on Oct. 1, others on Nov. 1 and so on. If the shutdown lasts until December, says Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association, still more programs would see their funding run out.</p> <p>Without federal funding, Sheridan says, some programs will have to close immediately. Others have the resources to stay open at least another week, in hopes that politicians in Washington can resolve their differences.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Cory Turner</em><em> and </em><em>Kadin Mills</em><em>, NPR</em></p>
<p><strong>What the shutdown means for federal workers</strong></p> <p>Altogether, about 1.4 million civilian federal employees across the country are going without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C.</p> <p>Of those, roughly half are furloughed, which means they are not working and not getting paid, but expect to return to work once the federal shutdown is over.</p> <p>The other half have been deemed essential and so are continuing to work.</p> <p>By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has tried to cast doubt on that.</p> <p>The Senate has failed to advance a pair of competing measures to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown. </p> <p>The Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, including active duty military and law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security.</p> <p>Many other federal workers are also still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year.</p>
<p><strong>Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown?</strong></p> <p>The Trump administration has been following through on threats to<strong> </strong>further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month.</p> <p>Some unions that represent workers are fighting back in court;  the federal judge overseeing the case on Tuesday indefinitely halted the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs, noting human toll. The order applies to federal employees in programs or offices where the plaintiff unions have members or bargaining units.</p> <p><strong>How is the shutdown impacting active duty military? </strong></p> <p>The Trump administration earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn't miss a full paycheck earlier this month, but it only covered one pay cycle. Many are expecting their next paycheck at the end of this month.</p> <p>Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills.</p>
<p><strong>USPS is 'open for business as usual'</strong></p> <p>"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted," according to a statement by USPS. The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.</p> <p><strong>IRS furloughs nearly half its staff</strong></p> <p>A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.</p> <p>The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.</p>
<p><em>— </em><em>Scott Horsley</em><em>, </em><em>Andrea Hsu</em><em> and </em><em>Stephen Fowler</em><em>, NPR</em></p> <p><strong>National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees</strong></p> <p>On Oct. 20, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines.</p> <p>According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the "Democrat shutdown."</p> <p>Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Geoff Brumfiel</em><em>, NPR</em></p> <p>In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open.</p> <p><strong>Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might</strong></p> <p>Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.</p> <p>At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department.</p> <p>This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. The courts have halted those layoffs. If they're ultimately allowed to go through, multiple sources told NPR the special education office would be left with just a handful of top executives and support staff.</p> <p>In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages.</p>
<p><em>— </em><em>Shannon Bond</em><em> and </em><em>Cory Turner</em><em>, NPR</em></p> <p>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's Corrinne Hess reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that student financial aid programs will continue, despite the shutdown.</p>
<p><strong>National Parks are a mixed bag</strong></p> <p>Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt. That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.</p> <p>As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails "will generally remain accessible to visitors" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.</p> <p>Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.</p> <p><strong>The Salem, Mass. visitor center will be open through Halloween thanks to community support</strong></p> <p>WBUR's Andrea Shea reports that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open.</p> <p>Shea reports that NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2.</p> <p><strong>Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue</strong></p> <p>Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue.</p>
<p>But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.</p> <p>In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters.</p> <p>Some furloughed employees at the Labor Department were brought back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. Last week, the SSA said the payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year, or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January.</p> <p><em>Read more on </em><em>how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown</em><em> from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin.</em></p> <p><strong>ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted</strong></p> <p>Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. "We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work," McLaughlin said.</p> <p>According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown.</p> <p>"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period," Noem posted on X last week. "By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a "super check" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period."</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, according to Noem; funds will be appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Ximena Bustillo</em><em>, NPR</em></p>
<p><strong>If you're flying soon …</strong></p> <p>Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered "essential workers" and have to stay on the job. This week they officially missed their first full paycheck since the shutdown began. </p> <p>Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.</p> <p>Air traffic controllers helped to end the last government shutdown, and could help end this one as well. According to NPR's Joel Rose, the Transportation Department says there has been an uptick in the number of controllers who are calling in sick.</p> <p>The Transportation Department says that federal subsidies for rural air travel will continue through Nov. 18, reports Alaska Public Media's Eric Stone. The department previously said it had enough funding to continue the program through Sunday.</p> <p><em>Read more on</em><em> what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown, here</em><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country</strong></p> <p>Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region.</p> <p>Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country:</p> <p><strong>Alaska</strong></p> <ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"><li>The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2.

<div class="article-title">Judge sentences former Jan. 6 defendant for hoax threat near Obama's home</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A federal judge has sentenced a man to time served for making a hoax threat near the D.C. residence of former President Barack Obama two years ago, prompting a massive law enforcement response that included a bomb squad and sniffer dogs.</p> <p>Taylor Taranto, of Pasco, Wash., spent 22 months in the troubled D.C. jail facility while he waited for trial on allegations that he suggested his van was rigged with explosives.  Authorities never found any such devices, though they did recover firearms and a machete.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols noted that Taranto had no criminal history — partly because the Justice Department had previously moved to dismiss several charges related to Taranto's participation in the siege on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p> <p>President Trump granted clemency to Taranto and virtually every Jan. 6 defendant on the first day he returned to the White House this year.</p> <p>But the storming of the Capitol and the Justice Department response to it continue to reverberate, especially within the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington.</p> <p>Trump and his cabinet officials are trying to rewrite the history of that day, in part by firing or forcing out law enforcement officials who investigated cases related to the riot. </p>
<p>This week the Justice Department sidelined two veteran prosecutors who had worked on the Taranto case and took the rare step of withdrawing a sentencing memo they had filed.</p> <p>U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro declined to comment on any personnel decisions but in a statement said "we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously."</p> <p>"We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target," Pirro said in the statement.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Original sentencing memo sealed, replaced</h3> <p>The original sentencing memo in Taranto's case detailed how a "mob of rioters" attacked the seat of government as Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 election.</p> <p>It also mentioned that Taranto headed in the direction of Obama's home after Trump reposted an address of a location on social media.</p> <p>A replacement sentencing memo, filed by a new pair of DOJ lawyers, scrubbed both of those references. The electronic court docket last night listed the original memo as sealed.</p> <p>Judge Nichols said it was "not entirely clear" how that memo had come to be sealed and that he intended to release it unless the DOJ could justify keeping it hidden.</p>
<p>The judge did not press the new attorneys for details about the rare, last-minute personnel switch. But he went out of his way to praise the sidelined prosecutors, Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White.</p> <p>"I just want to express my view that they did a commendable and excellent job in this case," Judge Nichols said. "They also held the highest standards of professionalism."</p> <p>At a press conference on a D.C. crime issue, Pirro declined to answer whether she ordered the original sentencing memo in the Taranto case to be revoked.</p> <p>"I think the papers speak for themselves and what goes on in this office is not something I'm going to comment on to the press," Pirro said.</p> <p>Valdivia and White listened on from the audience in the sixth floor courtroom, surrounded by some of the lawyers who had supervised hundreds of Capitol riot cases — only to be fired or forced out of the Justice Department this year.</p>
<p>Taranto, a Navy veteran with two children, has since returned home to Washington state. He will be required to serve three years of supervised release, undergo a mental health assessment, and to avoid firearms and controlled substances.</p> <p>"There's nothing that he did, in fact, that was violent," said defense attorney Carmen Hernandez. "The firearms were in a locked compartment in a van."</p> <p>Taranto signaled he would appeal in the coming weeks. He used his brief time before the judge to address what he called "deeply troubling issues concerning our founding, our history" and "election fraud for the 2020 election."<br/></p>

<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Each year, about 1,400 Spirit Halloween shops pop up across the U.S. Two student journalists, Isabel Jacobson and Adam Sanders, visited their local shop to meet the spirited employees who work there.</p>

<p>AILSA CHANG, HOST: </p><p> Just like those inflatable jack-o'-lanterns, Spirit Halloween stores have popped up across the country. There are about 1,400 locations each year selling fake blood, fog machines and lots of costumes. Well, two Princeton University student journalists took a closer look at their local shop last year.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "THE SPIRIT OF SPIRIT HALLOWEEN")</p><p>ISABEL JACOBSON: At the Quaker Bridge Mall in Lawrence Township, New Jersey, the parking lot is full. But people aren't going to the main entrance.</p><p>ADAM SANDERS: They're headed for the pop-up shop at one end of the parking lot, with posters of little girls dressed like killer clowns, boys dressed up as inflatable expletives and vivacious young women wearing nurse costumes.</p><p>JACOBSON: We're talking about Spirit Halloween. Every day here is October 31.</p><p>CHANG: Isabel Jacobson and Adam Sanders hosted this podcast. It was a finalist in NPR's College Podcast Contest. And we figured Halloween is a perfect time to share a bit of their story.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "THE SPIRIT OF SPIRIT HALLOWEEN")</p><p>JACOBSON: The animatronic decorations for sale stretch out skeletal hands with conspicuous price tags.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p><p>JACOBSON: It's undead, unreal - a world that only exists until November 3.</p><p>DEBBIE: Want to know how long it takes me to take down this store?</p><p>SANDERS: How long?</p><p>DEBBIE: Three days.</p><p>SANDERS: Three days.</p><p>That's Debbie (ph), one of the higher-ups at this Spirit Halloween. She's got long, pink-dyed hair, thick glasses and wears a T-shirt that in the top left corner says, Spirit Halloween 2021. She's a veteran.</p><p>DEBBIE: My husband spends way too much money on Spirit Halloween. And...</p><p>SANDERS: Really?</p><p>DEBBIE: ...The only reason I put in the application was for the 30% discount, to be honest.</p><p>JACOBSON: Now Debbie runs multiple Spirit Halloweens across central New Jersey. She deals with costume shipments from Spencer's Corporate, who owns the chain, as well as setting up elaborate decorations and hiring teams of Halloween fanatics. For Debbie, it's a great gig.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p><p>JACOBSON: The store is basically one big haunted house, with the caveat that they're trying to sell you a polyester "Minions" costume and some plastic skulls along the way. Anthony (ph), a cashier, told us this experiential aspect of the store was a big part of his attraction to working there.</p><p>ANTHONY: People come in, they're screaming, they're yelling, they're laughing, they're scared. They're having a good time. They're watching their friends get scared, their children get scared. I think for the most part, we just want it to be an experience.</p><p>JACOBSON: Spirit Halloween is a silly place. Nothing you buy here is going to last.</p><p>SANDERS: Not even the stores last. They're open for only a few months at a time before returning to their hibernation. You can make the argument that with all of the fun of the decorations or the giddiness of picking out a costume, Spirit Halloween is, in the end, a store in a mall that sells you plastic.</p><p>JACOBSON: But what surprised us about spending an afternoon at the Spirit Halloween in Lawrence Township was how deeply anti-materialist it felt to speak to the employees, who come back to the store season after season to sell costumes and candy and decorations. On Halloween, they said, you celebrate expression, choosing your own identity, reveling in the shocking or the transgressive or the fun. You make a statement about who you are.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED EMPLOYEE #1: It's the only holiday that you don't have to give anybody anything.</p><p>SANDERS: (Laughter).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED EMPLOYEE #1: It's all about you if you want it to be. You know what I mean?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED EMPLOYEE #2: So it's always fun, you know. I mean, it's still a job, but it's fun and it's - I can't complain.</p><p>JACOBSON: Yeah.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED EMPLOYEE #1: Yeah.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED EMPLOYEE #2: Probably one of the better jobs I ever had.</p><p>JACOBSON: This has been Izzy (ph) Jacobson.</p><p>SANDERS: And Adam Sanders.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED EMPLOYEE #2: Have a wonderful evening, and once again, thank you for choosing Spirit Halloween for all of your Halloween needs.</p><p>CHANG: And we should note, as this is a student podcast, it does something we generally do not do here at NPR. It identifies people by first name only.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF DANNY ELFMAN SONG, "THIS IS HALLOWEEN")</p>

<p>LONDON — King Charles III is stripping his brother Prince Andrew of his remaining titles and evicting him from his royal residence, Buckingham Palace said Thursday.</p>
<p>In a statement, the palace said Andrew will be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor and not as a prince, and he will move from his Royal Lodge residence into "private accommodation."</p> <p>The move follows revelations about Andrew's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>Pressure had been growing on the palace to oust the prince from Royal Lodge after he surrendered his use of the title Duke of York earlier this month over his friendship with Epstein and allegations by one of Epstein's victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre.</p> <p>But the king went even further, stripping him of the title of prince that he has had since birth as a child of a monarch, the late Queen Elizabeth II.</p> <p>"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him," the palace said. "Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse."</p>

<div class="article-title">4 GOP senators join Democrats to rebuke Trump on tariffs for a third time this week</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>In a series of three votes this week, a slim majority of the GOP-led Senate delivered a rare, bipartisan rebuke of President Trump's use of emergency powers to set tariffs on Canada, Brazil and other countries.</p> <p>The last of these votes — a measure approved Thursday to roll back global tariffs announced by Trump in April — passed by a margin of 51 to 47. Democrats cleared the measure with support from four Republicans: Susan Collins of Maine, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Kentucky's Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul.</p> <p>"The way that the president has imposed the tariffs is leading to nothing but chaos," Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the lead sponsor of the measure, said ahead of the vote. Kaine said the strategy behind Trump's tariff policy amounted to, "Announce tariffs on everyone, then announce that they may be suspended or delayed while I work out one-on-one deals."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the same four Republican senators joined Democrats to approve resolutions to terminate tariffs on Brazil and Canada that were announced using emergency powers. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., joined Democrats to terminate the Brazil tariffs, which he argued specifically had no rational basis.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Senate Republicans voted against the measures, with many saying that at this point they're counterproductive to the president's tariff program. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said Trump's new plans to lower China's tariffs Thursday were a good reminder. Trump announced the plans after meeting in South Korea with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. </p> <p>"The president's negotiations are bearing fruit. President Trump already announced new trade deals," Crapo said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. "Other deals are, hopefully, forthcoming."</p> <p>However, the success of this week's resolution votes, which only needed a simple majority to pass, may not go far. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., installed a special rule to block such votes in the House, so they're currently unlikely to reach the floor. Even if they were to somehow pass the House, President Trump would almost certainly veto them.</p> <p>Still, the vote marked a test of support for the president's tariff policies among Republicans, reflecting unease inside the party about their impacts on the U.S. economy, and specifically the farming and manufacturing sectors. It came ahead of arguments at the Supreme Court this fall in a case challenging Trump's authority to put sweeping tariffs in place using emergency powers.</p>
<p>Thursday's vote wasn't the first time Senate Republicans took up Trump's authority to set global tariffs. In April, a similar measure failed 49 to 49. That same month, a measure to block tariffs on Canada drew a simple majority in the Senate.</p> <p>"Since then our nation's trade policy has looked pretty much like a dog chasing a squirrel," Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a lead co-sponsor of the global tariffs resolution, said on the Senate floor on Thursday. "More tariffs threatened, added, taken away, thousands of packages being destroyed because the customs service wasn't prepared, secretive deals to lift tariffs for certain companies and products that have influence at the White House."</p>
<p>The Republicans who broke ranks did so despite a lobbying push by Vice President JD Vance, who met with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday and urged them to back the president's policies. Vance told reporters after the lunch meeting that the tariffs are critical leverage for Trump in international negotiations.</p> <p>But Tillis, for example, was one of those Republicans not convinced when it came at least to the Brazil tariffs.</p> <p>"I just don't think there's a rational basis for it," Tillis said.</p> <p>Trump triggered the Brazil tariffs this summer to pressure the country's government to end what he called a "witch hunt" against his ally, former far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Last month, Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup to stay in power following his 2022 election defeat.</p>

<div class="article-title">A judge is set to decide whether SNAP benefits can be cut off on Saturday</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>BOSTON — A federal judge indicated Thursday she is inclined to take steps to ensure that federal food assistance keeps flowing to 42 million Americans who depend on it. Trump administration officials say because of the government shutdown, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, will be cut off on Saturday. </p> <p>"The well has run dry," the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, posted on its website.</p>
<p>But Democratic governors and attorneys general from some two dozen states sued the federal government to keep the payments coming, arguing SNAP benefits are an entitlement that cannot legally be cut off. They also make the case that stopping benefits would cause irreparable harm to millions of Americans, and to the state governments who will be left to deal with the fallout.</p> <p>The Trump administration had argued the opposite; officials say they are legally <em>prohibited</em> from extending the benefits by using emergency funds.</p>
<p>But after an hour of arguments in Boston federal court Thursday, Judge Indira Talwani wasn't buying it.</p>
<p>"Congress put money in an emergency fund, and it is hard for me to understand how this is not an emergency," Talwani said. "It's really clear to me that what Congress was trying to do was protect the American people," she said, and she believes it was lawmakers intent to ensure that in the event of something like a shutdown, "we're not going to make everyone drop dead because it's a political game someplace else."</p> <p>Even if the emergency fund is tapped for SNAP benefits, administration officials say its $5.5 billion falls short of the $9 billion needed to fully cover the whole month of November. They say recalculating benefits and arranging for partial payments would be a logistical nightmare — and could take weeks.</p> <p>That means millions of Americans would still see some delay in receiving their next benefit, and they would also be receiving less than usual.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump administration sets lowest-ever cap on refugee admissions to U.S.</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The Trump administration is drastically cutting the number of refugees it will admit to the U.S., capping it at 7,500 for the current fiscal year. That's the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was established in 1980.</p> <p>The U.S. wants to primarily admit Afrikaners from South Africa, according to a notification in the Federal Register filed on Thursday, and "other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands."</p> <p>The administration has largely paused the U.S. refugee resettlement program so far this year, with the exception of a streamlined process of resettlement for white South Africans. Several hundred from the group have been resettled across the U.S. since March.</p>
<p>In response, some resettlement groups have been quick to voice concern over the lack of resources and limits on admission of those from other countries. Others have shuttered their services, changing the landscape of the refugee resettlement process.</p> <p>Thursday's notification, which covers the fiscal year that started October 1, does not provide a reason for the lower cap, beyond mentioning previous Trump administration policies on refugees, including pausing admissions overall and barring admissions from countries seen as threats to U.S. security and welfare.</p> <p>"The Trump administration has long expressed its intention to end Biden's abuse of the refugee program," a Trump administration official said in a statement. "No refugees will be admitted in [fiscal year] 26 until the appropriate consultations with Congress are held, which are being delayed because certain members of Congress insisted on shutting down the government."</p> <p>Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, previously told reporters that criteria for bringing in refugees included making sure that they did not pose a national security challenge and could be easily assimilated.</p>
<p>"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing," Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, said in a statement. "At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program's purpose as well as its credibility."</p> <p>The Biden administration had set the refugee cap at 125,000 for fiscal year 2025.</p> <p>Senate Democrats, including Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Trump administration disobeyed the law by not consulting with Congress on the refugee cap before imposing it.</p>
<p>The administration's lack of consultation "demonstrates its tacit acknowledgement that this decision is indefensible," they wrote in a statement. "President Trump's move undermines the role that America has long played in the world as a beacon of stability and a refuge for those fleeing genocide, political persecution and war crimes."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Push for higher caps</h3> <p>Refugee advocates have spent the year pushing for a broader range of admissions beyond Afrikaners, including admitting people from other countries who had already been vetted to arrive in the U.S.</p> <p>"It is egregious to exclude refugees who completed years of rigorous security checks and are currently stuck in dangerous and precarious situations," said Sharif Aly, president of the International Refugee Assistance Project. He said that the number of those with confirmed travel plans to the U.S. is greater than the new refugee cap.</p>
<p>The admission of Afrikaners to the U.S. has drawn scrutiny from resettlement agencies in the U.S., who have faced sharp budget, resource, and personnel cuts since President Trump took office.</p> <p>Among his first executive actions, Trump paused the refugee resettlement program. Various agencies including the State Department have also paused disbursing funding for critical services for other refugees, such as the home, job and school assistance the Afrikaners are poised to receive.</p> <p>The pause also sent the refugee resettlement agencies into turmoil as refugees already cleared to arrive in the U.S. received notice their flights had been cancelled.</p>
<p>Among those left in limbo were Afghans who worked with the U.S. military, a move that some Republicans have criticized. A lower-court judge had ordered the government to at least resume the refugee program for those who had already been approved to travel, but an appeals court ruled in favor of the administration.</p> <p>The notice in the Federal Register makes no mention of Afghans, despite past promises to help those who supported the U.S. in America's longest war.<br/></p>
