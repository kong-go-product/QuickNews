<div class="article-title">Dodgers stave off elimination to set up winner-take-all World Series Game 7</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The defending World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers entered Friday night just one loss away from elimination.</p><p>But a bold move to bring in Sunday's projected starter, Tyler Glasnow, in the final frame of the ninth inning helped the Dodgers survive.</p><p>Glasnow entered Friday’s win-or-go home game with a Toronto Blue Jays runner on second and another on third base. It took Glasnow just three pitches to get three outs to close the game and force a Game 7.</p><p>Two of those outs came after the Dodgers turned what appeared to be a potential game-tying hit into a dramatic, game-ending double play.</p><p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts decided to shake up the lineup again for Game 6.</p><p>After moving from second to third in the order in Wednesday’s Game 5 loss, shortstop Mookie Betts dropped into the cleanup spot Friday against Blue Jays right-hander Kevin Gausman.</p><p>Betts had not hit as low as fourth since the final game of the 2017 American League Division Series against Houston. Game 5 was the first time since 2021 that Betts started but wasn't in one of the top two spots in Los Angeles' lineup.</p><p>Betts entered Game 6 hitting just 3-for-23 with no RBIs or extra-base hits in the World Series, but he made the most of his new spot in the batting order, delivering a two-run single in the third inning.</p><p>Dodgers starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto was not quite as sharp as in his Game 2 four-hitter, the first World Series complete game in a decade. He lasted six innings and allowed only a third-inning RBI single by George Springer, who returned after missing two games with an injury to his right side.</p><p>After the game, Roberts explained his decision to use Glasnow in relief.  </p><p>"This is do or die. You've got to leave it all out there and pick up all the pieces," Roberts told FOX Sports. " Roki (Sasaki) wasn't as sharp. I felt right there Glasnow had swing and miss stuff and I just wanted to bet on him."</p><p>Max Scherzer will start Game 7 on Saturday night for the Blue Jays. He also started the last World Series Game 7, getting a no-decision when Washington won the 2019 title over Houston.</p><p>The Dodgers are seeking to become the first team to win consecutive titles since the New York Yankees won three straight from 1998 to 2000. Meanwhile, the Blue Jays hope to end their championship drought by securing their first World Series title since 1993.</p><p>Game 7 is scheduled for Saturday at 8 p.m. ET on FOX.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p><p> sports coverage on X the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Illinois lawmakers pass bill banning ICE immigration arrests near courthouses</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Illinois lawmakers passed a bill on Friday prohibiting federal agents from making immigration arrests near courthouses.</p><p>The measure also allows lawsuits when people believe their constitutional rights were violated during civil immigration arrests.</p><p>The legislation, approved largely along party lines, was sent to Democrat Gov. JB Pritzker's desk. His office said he supports the idea and will review the proposal when it reaches his desk.</p><p>According to the bill, civil damages for false imprisonment could be imposed when a migrant attending a court hearing or appearing as a party or witness to a legal proceeding is arrested.</p><p>Supporters of the bill say courts must be accessible to everyone to seek resolutions to violations of their rights, but even one of the measure's top sponsors acknowledges it will face an uphill battle in court.</p><p>"It’s not just about the constitutionality of the law, which I think is sound, but it’s the reality that the courts are stacked against us," Democrat Senate President Don Harmon said. "The federal government can try to remove it from state courts to federal courts. They can try to substitute the government itself for the individual defendants, but that’s not a reason not to try."</p><p>Earlier this month, a judge in Cook County, which includes Chicago, issued an order blocking immigration arrests at county courthouses, citing concerns about "fear or obstruction" while migrants attend court proceedings. The order prohibits immigration authorities from making civil arrests of any "party, witness, or potential witness" during court appearances.</p><p>The federal government, however, contended that "there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law."</p><p>The Trump administration's immigration agenda aims to detain suspected illegal migrants as part of the president's mass deportation policies. But witnesses have reported numerous incidents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detaining people regardless of citizenship or legal status.</p><p>"No one should have to choose between seeking justice and risking their freedom," said Democrat state Sen. Celina Villanueva, who is co-sponsoring the bill. "Courthouses must be places where people can resolve disputes, testify and support loved ones, not sites of fear or intimidation."</p><p>The measure also requires hospitals, day care centers and higher education institutions to create policies detailing how they would handle immigration agents inside their facilities.</p><p>Earlier this year, the federal government reversed a Biden administration policy prohibiting immigration arrests in sensitive locations such as hospitals, schools and churches.</p><p>Other states have made similar efforts to protect migrants against federal raids.</p><p>California has restricted immigration enforcement action in courthouses since 2017. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state cannot control federal immigration action, but "the state has a responsibility to provide safe and secure access to court facilities to all residents regardless of immigration status."</p><p>In Connecticut, state Supreme Court Chief Justice Raheem Mullins issued a policy in September banning warrantless arrests inside state courts, and prohibited the use of face coverings, often worn by ICE officers to shield their identities, in judicial buildings.</p><p>"Judges, staff, litigants, members of the public, they all must be able to conduct their business in our courthouses without fear of disruption," Mullins said.</p><p>Other bills introduced by various local governments and Congress also seek to ban face coverings for immigration agents.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">VP JD Vance dresses up as his own viral meme for Halloween, social media post tops 15 million views</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Vice President JD Vance leaned into an internet joke at his own expense this Halloween, posting a short video of himself wearing a curly brown wig to mimic a meme that’s followed him for months.</p><p>In the TikTok clip, filmed at the Naval Observatory residence, Vance opens the door in a dark suit and red tie, smiling as he tells trick-or-treaters, "Happy Halloween, kids ... remember, say thank you!" The line is a playful callback to the "you didn’t say thank you" meme before he spins under purple lights to the eerie "Twilight Zone" theme.</p><p>The 41-year-old vice president’s video racked up more than 250,000 likes and 14 million views within hours, an extraordinary number for a political post, and drew thousands of comments across Instagram, X and Facebook.</p><p>Vance first became the butt of the "fat JD with curly hair" meme after a tense White House exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February. Critics edited a photo of Vance with exaggerated features and wild hair, pairing it with captions like, "you didn’t say please" or "you didn’t say thank you."</p><p>Rather than ignore the ridicule, Vance embraced it. Earlier this week, the White House X account joined the online fun, posting mock "costume package" images of political figures, including a "JD Vance Costume" that jokingly "does not include the fat JD curly hair." Vance’s own Halloween post essentially completed the gag by adding that missing piece himself.</p><p>Within hours, the vice president’s post was trending. Screenshots flooded social media, with one user calling him "the best VP ever" and another saying, "JD just won 2028." Elon Musk responded simply with a laughing emoji.</p><p>Even some critics gave credit. One commenter on X said, "he did the meme lol." Users quickly remixed the Halloween look with the original meme, adding jump cuts and effects as it spread across platforms.</p><p>For a White House that thrives on viral content, Vance’s light-hearted stunt fits seamlessly into the Trump administration’s digital playbook. The comms shop for President Trump has long embraced meme culture and rapid-fire online humor, sometimes even powered by AI.</p><p>By Friday night, Vance’s Halloween post was still climbing past 14 million views.</p><p>For now, JD Vance has done what few politicians manage by turning a meme into a personal win and proving that, at least on Halloween, even the vice president can laugh along with the internet (in a wig).</p><p>The office of Vice President JD Vance did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A federal judge has ruled the Trump administration cannot enforce an executive order requiring documented proof of U.S. citizenship on federal voter registration forms, a decision the administration defends as a lawful effort to protect election integrity.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, D.C., on Friday found the requirement unconstitutional, writing that the president "lacks the authority to direct such changes."</p><p>"The first question presented in these consolidated cases is whether the president, acting unilaterally, may direct changes to federal election procedures," Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion. </p><p>"Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes."</p><p>However, a spokesperson for the White House told Fox News Digital Trump acted within his legal powers.</p><p>"President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to ensure only American citizens are casting ballots in American elections," White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital in an email. "This is so commonsense that only the Democrat Party would file a lawsuit against it.</p><p>"We expect to be vindicated by a higher court."</p><p>The judge sided with the plaintiffs — including the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the Democratic National Committee and the League of Women Voters Education Fund — arguing the Constitution "assigns no direct role to the president in either domain."</p><p>The ruling says the U.S. Election Assistance Commission is permanently blocked from adding the requirement to the federal voter form, according to The Associated Press.</p><p>The lawsuit will continue as the judge examines other parts of Trump’s order, according to The Associated Press.</p><p>In March, President Trump signed an executive order mandating that anyone registering to vote provide government-issued proof of U.S. citizenship.</p><p>The order also directed the attorney general to enter into information-sharing agreements with state election officials to identify cases of election fraud or other election law violations and conditioned federal election-related funds on states complying with federal election integrity measures.</p><p>"There are other steps that we will be taking in the coming weeks," Trump said just before signing the order. "We think we'll be able to end up getting fair elections."</p><p>Kollar-Kotelly previously issued a preliminary injunction in April, and another federal judge blocked the same March 25 executive order in June after a separate challenge brought by Democratic state attorneys general, The Associated Press reported.</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p><p><i>Fox News' Louis Casiano, Shannon Bream and Bill Mears contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Brian Kelly faces harsh criticism from LSU football staffers after dismissal</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>After reaching unprecedented heights coaching the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Brian Kelly agreed to take on a new challenge in the Southeastern Conference. </p><p>Kelly signed a lucrative 10-year contract with LSU in December 2021. The bold and often brash coach was tasked with bringing the proud football program another national championship. </p><p>A look back at the last three coaches to hold the head coaching job at LSU — Ed Orgeron, Les Miles and Nick Saban — shows all three concluded their fourth seasons by hoisting a national championship trophy.</p><p>Not only did Kelly fail to have the Tigers on track for a trip to the College Football Playoff, but his fourth season at the helm ended prematurely. On Sunday, LSU athletic director Scott Woodward announced the school had decided to part ways with Kelly.</p><p>Woodward was dismissed Thursday after he was criticized by Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry</p><p>In the fallout from Kelly's unceremonious exit, individuals associated with LSU during the polarizing coach's tenure are speaking out.</p><p>While Kelly managed to reach double-digit wins in each of his first two seasons in Baton Rouge, current and former players took issue with his apparent hands-off approach and his failure to build strong relationships.</p><p>A group of unnamed LSU staffers told The Athletic Kelly struggled at times to remember some of the full names of players he coached. </p><p>"[LSU’s rivals would] use that against us: ‘He’ll never talk to you guys. He doesn’t even know the players’ names,'" a staff member told the outlet.</p><p>A staffer also accused Kelly of ruining LSU's culture and failing to fully grasp the differences between an SEC program and what he may have grown accustomed to while finding success at Notre Dame.</p><p>"He really stripped the culture of what this place is. You know this place is not regular, man," the LSU staffer said. </p><p>Kelly's representatives could not be reached for comment.</p><p>The normally packed and raucous Tiger Stadium was nearly empty by the final quarter of LSU’s blowout loss to Texas A&amp;M Saturday. Kelly met with Woodward on Sunday and then with the players.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump vows to ‘fund SNAP as soon as possible’ if court allows, blasts Democrats over shutdown delay</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump said Friday his administration has asked federal courts to clarify whether it can legally release Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) payments as the government shutdown continues.</p><p>In a statement posted to Truth Social, Trump said government lawyers had raised doubts about whether existing funds could be used for the November distribution and that two courts have issued conflicting opinions on the matter.</p><p>"Our Government lawyers do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available, and now two Courts have issued conflicting opinions on what we can and cannot do," Trump wrote. "I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT."</p><p>The president said he had instructed administration attorneys to ask the courts for clarification "as soon as possible."</p><p>"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay," Trump added. "The Democrats should quit this charade where they hurt people for their own political reasons, and immediately REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT."</p><p>Trump urged food stamp recipients to contact Senate Democrats, writing, "If you use SNAP benefits, call the Senate Democrats, and tell them to reopen the Government, NOW! Here is Cryin’ Chuck Schumer’s Office Number."</p><p>SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, provides aid to about 42 million Americans each month, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Funding for the program depends on congressional appropriations, which have lapsed during the current shutdown.</p><p>The president made his comments one day before the scheduled Nov. 1 payment date for many recipients. The USDA has not publicly confirmed whether benefits will be issued if the courts do not provide new guidance.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly accused Democrats of prolonging the shutdown to gain political leverage, while Democrats say the White House could reopen the government by signing a short-term spending bill already passed in the Senate.</p><p>In his post, Trump referenced his earlier actions to protect military and law enforcement paychecks during the standoff, calling it his duty to "ensure Americans don’t go hungry."</p><p>No court filings related to SNAP funding had been publicly docketed as of Friday afternoon.</p><p>The White House referred Fox News Digital to President Trump's Truth Social post when pressed for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Kim Kardashian doesn't believe America made it to the moon in 1969, and NASA is hitting back.</p><p>On the most recent episode of "The Kardashians," the reality TV star attempted to convince Sarah Paulson the moon landing never happened.</p><p>On Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins became the first humans on the moon in 1969. The flight was a defining moment in the space race between America and the Soviet Union.</p><p>Only 12 men, all Americans, have walked on the moon.</p><p>"I'm sending you, so far, a million articles with both Buzz Aldrin and ... the other one," she told Paulson, referring to Neil Armstrong. </p><p>"Yes, do it," Paulson said on the episode that aired Thursday night.</p><p>"This girl says, 'What was the scariest moment?' And [Aldrin] goes, 'There was no scary moment, cause it didn’t happen. It could've been scary, but it wasn't, cause it didn't happen,'" Kardashian said.</p><p>According to Kardashian, the astronaut has "gotten old" and makes mistakes when discussing the famous moon landing. </p><p>"So, I think it didn’t happen," Kardashian concluded.</p><p>Paulson, Kardashian's "All's Fair" co-star, admitted Kardashian's take on the moon landing made her take a "massive deep dive." During a confessional moment of the reality show, Kardashian admitted she sends Paulson "conspiracies all the time."</p><p>A producer of the show followed up with Kardashian when she was back in her trailer and asked her if she believed astronauts made it to the moon.</p><p>"I don’t think we did. I think it was fake," she said. </p><p>"I’ve seen a few videos [of] Buzz Aldrin talking about how it didn’t happen. He says it all the time now in interviews."</p><p>Kardashian continued to defend her claim.</p><p>"Why does Buzz Aldrin say it didn't happen? There's no gravity on the moon. Why is the flag blowing? The shoes that they have in the museum that they wore on the moon [have] a different [foot]print than the photos. Why are there no stars?" she asked. </p><p>On Thursday, NASA acting Administrator Sean Duffy took to X, formerly Twitter, to reassure Kardashian that, yes, Americans have made it to the moon.</p><p>"Yes, Kim Kardashian, we've been to the Moon before… 6 times!" he wrote, tagging the star. Duffy explained that, thanks to President Donald Trump, America is back in the space race with NASA Artemis.</p><p>"And even better: @NASAArtemis is going back under the leadership of @POTUS. We won the last space race and we will win this one too," Duffy wrote alongside the clip of Kardashian and Paulson on the reality show.</p><p>Kardashian replied to Duffy's post, "Wait…. what’s the tea on 3I Atlas?!?!!!!!!!?????"</p><p>During the show, a producer asked Kardashian what she would think if people reacted to her theory.</p><p>"They’re gonna say I’m crazy no matter what. But, like, go to TikTok. See for yourself," she said.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett lent his support to President Donald Trump, calling for Republicans to end the filibuster to bring the government shutdown to an end in an interview Friday on "The Story." </p><p>"Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!" the president wrote on Truth Social, saying Republicans should use what he referred to as the "nuclear option."</p><p>The "nuclear option" would remove a 60-vote threshold, leading Republicans to only require a simple majority to pass their federal funding bill. </p><p>Hassett agreed that the filibuster should be "on the table" because the Democrats might "try to keep the government shut down forever as far as we know." </p><p>Both House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., have expressed hesitation about getting rid of the filibuster and its 60-vote threshold.</p><p>Hassett also theorized that Democratic politicians are trying to "stop the president’s momentum" after a "historic" trip to Asia, lauding a soybean deal reached with China’s President Xi Jinping. </p><p>"We’re not going to let them keep the government shut forever," Hassett said. "We’re not going to let them starve the American people." </p><p>Hassett stressed the importance of bringing the shutdown to an end before the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which delivers relief to around 42 million Americans who rely on the aid, will see benefits expire Nov. 1. An expiration of SNAP would be the first time in 60 years the program has halted due to a government shutdown.</p><p>"We’re about to use emergency funds from the Department of Agriculture," Hassett said, referring to ways to fund the program. </p><p>This comes after court orders to tap into emergency funds from two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ahead of the Nov. 1 expiration of benefits. </p><p>Hassett criticized what he called a "liberal judge ruling," saying that tapping emergency funds would make the government vulnerable in a future hurricane or food emergency. </p><p>Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., criticized Trump for "using hunger as a political weapon," referring to SNAP. </p><p>"What really surprises me is the level of cruelty that is marking Republican leadership right now," Booker said. </p><p>Hassett reacted by saying Democrats need to do their "constitutional duty" and reopen the government. </p><p>"The Democrats don’t really have a plan," he said. "We don’t really understand what they’re doing anymore." </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Trump announced Friday that renovations have been completed on the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom in the White House, revealing the redesigned space in a series of posts on Truth Social.</p><p>The bathroom, which was last updated in the 1940s with a green tile design, has been reimagined with black-and-white marble — a look the President described as more fitting for the Lincoln era.</p><p>"I renovated the Lincoln Bathroom in the White House. It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era," Trump posted to Truth Social on Friday.</p><p>Trump added, "I did it in black and white polished statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!"</p><p>The President shared multiple photos on Truth Social of the remodel, which showcased the bathroom's marble walls and gold fixtures.</p><p>"The Refurbished Lincoln Bathroom in the White House — Highly polished, Statuary marble!" Trump said in one of the posts.</p><p>The office and cabinet room once used by America’s 16th president, Abraham Lincoln, has been known as the Lincoln Bedroom since 1945, when President Harry S.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Dallas Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer had an unexpected visitor at his house on Thursday. </p><p>Schottenheimer, 52, found an owl flying around his living room. </p><p>"I'm in game-plan meetings last night doing some red zone stuff, and I leave the meeting about 10 o'clock. Amd I go back to my phone, and I literally had 72 text messages on my phone. Seventy-two. I'm a popular guy, so that's nothing abnormal," Schottenheimer told reporters on Friday. </p><p>"But it literally started with a text from my son to his mother saying, 'Umm, there's a big hawk-sized bird in here,' and I began to look down, and there was an owl."</p><p>The Cowboys head coach called his niece and soon-to-be nephew for assistance with the owl, but they got nowhere. </p><p>"We’re not very outdoorsy people, and so he wasn’t really quite sure what to do. So, he called my soon-to-be nephew, who’s marrying my niece, and the two of them together, Frick and Frack, tried to figure it out. They couldn’t do it. All they did was piss it off. And, so, in typical coaching fashion, I called my wife, and I said, ‘Honey, I’m going to stay at the condo tonight, you got this,'" Schottenheimer said. </p><p>Eventually, animal control was called, and the owl was removed. </p><p>"The owl has been returned to its safe domain. … They called animal control. A gentleman came with a net, like a pool net. I might have to look at that as another job. Just kinda become an animal control guy. I’m so experienced now with wildlife in and around Dallas," Schottenheimer said. </p><p>The owl was not the first encounter Schottenheimer has had with wildlife this season. Prior to the team’s first win of the season over the New York Giants in Week 2, he ran into an issue with snakes. </p><p>Two of his dogs were bitten by snakes earlier that week, but it turned into a Cowboys win. Schottenheimer called the owl a "good omen" and said he would be willing to keep an elephant in his garage if it meant a win for the Cowboys. </p><p>The Cowboys are 3-4-1 and take on the Arizona Cardinals (2-5) Monday at 8:15 p.m. ET. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Supreme Court prepares to confront monumental case over Trump executive power and tariff authority</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Economic imperative or executive overreach? That is the question the Supreme Court is preparing this week to confront, in one of its most monumental appeals over the scope of executive power, a time-sensitive challenge to President Donald Trump's expansive import tariffs over most countries.</p><p>The justices will hear oral arguments Wednesday over lawsuits from a coalition of small businesses and several Democratic-led states, who say Trump has abused his authority by declaring a "national emergency" to impose levies on nearly every country in the world.</p><p>At issue is whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) gives the president that power.</p><p>Lower federal courts have ruled against the Executive Branch, but Trump's Justice Department warns "denial of tariff authority would expose our nation to trade retaliation without effective defenses."</p><p>The financial and political stakes are enormous, with potential immediate effects on the domestic and global economies. Businesses and industries, large and small, are nervously watching how the Court will act.</p><p>"The Supreme Court will decide whether or not Congress, in fact, gave the president the fairly broad authority that he's claimed to impose [tariffs] on, in a way that no president has used it before," said Thomas Dupree, a leading appellate attorney and a former top Justice Department official. "Not to say that's necessarily impermissible, but it is something that the Supreme Court has not seen in recent years and is going to weigh in on whether or not he's overstepped the authority that he has under the law."</p><p>The consolidated, expedited appeals will be the first major test on the merits of the White House's aggressive second-term agenda to remake large swaths of the federal government, and the outsized role this president has so far played.</p><p>The administration has been winning most of the emergency appeals at the Supreme Court since January dealt only with whether challenged policies could go into effect temporarily, while the issues play out in the lower courts — including immigration, federal spending cuts, workforce reductions and transgenders in the military.</p><p>In doing so, the 6-3 conservative majority has reversed about two dozen preliminary nationwide injunctions imposed by lower federal courts, leading to frustration and confusion among many judges.</p><p>Now those percolating petitions are starting to reach the Supreme Court for final review — and legal analysts say the bench may be poised to grant broad unilateral powers to the president.</p><p>The justices fast-tracked the administration's appeal over sweeping tariffs on nearly every country, which were blocked by lower courts.</p><p>A high court ruling on the merits could come quickly, perhaps within weeks. Both sides have urged a quick decision, since the U.S. has been engaged in active, ongoing trade negotiations with dozens of countries over the past months.</p><p>This could be the start of several high-profile merits appeals over Trump's executive actions.</p><p>In December, the justices will decide whether to overturn a 90-year precedent dealing with the president's ability to fire members of some federal regulatory agencies like the Federal Trade Commission. </p><p>And in January, the power of President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors will be tested in another major constitutional showdown. For now, the Biden-appointed Cook will remain on the job.</p><p>Other appeals that could be added to the high court argument docket include birthright citizenship and other immigration-related petitions, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies in educational institutions and the environment.</p><p>Congress is given the power under the Constitution's Article I to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises."</p><p>But when Trump in February began issuing a series of executive orders, he relied on the IEEPA, which gives the president the power — under a self-declared national economic emergency — to "investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any acquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer, withdrawal, transportation, importation or exportation of, or dealing in, or exercising any right, power, or privilege with respect to, or transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest."</p><p>The Trump Justice Department says the choices are stark.</p><p>"President Trump and his advisors have determined that erroneously invalidating the IEEPA tariffs, 'would have catastrophic consequences for our national security, foreign policy, and economy,'" wrote U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who will argue the case before the justices. Citing Trump's own words, "The President has emphasized: 'If the United States were forced to unwind these historic agreements ... the economic consequences would be ruinous, instead of unprecedented success."</p><p>But the plaintiffs claim no president until now in the law's five decades has ever used it to impose "sweeping worldwide" tariffs.</p><p>"Context, history and common sense all support a more modest understanding of that provision — one that leaves the President ample tools to address emergencies but does not delegate Congress' tariffing power wholesale," wrote Benjamin Gutman, Oregon's solicitor general, who will argue the case for the state plaintiffs. "This Court should reject the President’s bid to seize that power for himself."</p><p>Two categories of tariffs involving a variety of products are being contested: The first are "trafficking tariffs," on goods from Canada, China and Mexico, imposed after the Trump administration said those nations have not done enough to reduce the flow of fentanyl.</p><p>The second, broader category, labeled "reciprocal tariffs," involves tariffs ranging from 10% to 50% on products from virtually all countries.     </p><p>The Supreme Court will hold at least 80-minutes of scheduled oral arguments in its marble-lined courtroom, but the public session is expected to last much longer.</p><p>The justices will almost certainly have many questions of counsel from both sides, since they will be confronting a range of novel legal and constitutional questions over Trump's tariff authority.</p><p>The arguments — audio of which will be streamed live on the court's website — will consist of the bench posing questions, comments and hypotheticals to lawyers from the federal government, private business and the states.</p><p>After the public sessions, the justices will meet privately — perhaps later Wednesday — and vote on the case, at least preliminarily.</p><p>The majority and any dissenting opinions will be assigned, and the court go begin articulating a ruling that will serve as precedent for this and future disputes over executive authority.</p><p>The court will have no shortage of information to ponder. In addition to the written briefs filed by the opposing parties, about four dozen "amicus" briefs have been filed, offering a range of legal positions from advocacy groups, other state governments and legal and economic scholars.</p><p>The unpredictable, ongoing rollout of tariffs has created global economic uncertainty and fears of higher consumer prices, but Trump has also used them as political leverage to pressure countries into negotiating new trade deals.</p><p>"A big fraction of the Supreme Court's docket will present the question, can President Trump do: fill in the blank? And that includes imposed tariffs," said Dupree. "Trump is pushing at every limit and the Supreme Court this term is going to be telling us whether he's exceeded those limits. That is going to be the story of so much of what the Supreme Court is deciding this term is whether the president has [acted] within or has exceeded." </p><p>Of more immediate focus, the tariff cases will offer a tantalizing "first look" guide of how broadly the conservative majority high court views Trump's muscular view of presidential power, a template for almost certain future appeals of his executive agenda.</p><p>The cases are Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump (24-1287);  Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, Inc. (25-250).</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Miami Dolphins shook things up Friday when they announced they mutually parted ways with general manager Chris Grier.</p><p>After a lot of disappointment, Thursday night's blowout home loss to the Baltimore Ravens seemed to be the final straw for both sides, and they mutually ended their relationship.</p><p>Stephen A. Smith, though, appeared to believe the sides used a technicality to avoid saying Grier lost his job. He later seemed to question why Grier, who is Black, was "fired" before head coach Mike McDaniel.</p><p></p><p>"This is BS. That’s the first fire? Really? That’s what we’re doing?' It was about Tua [Tagovailoa]. It was about Mike McDaniel. And the brother gets fired first?" Smith said when the news broke while he was on "First Take."</p><p>"I'm not saying that he don't deserve it because of the way they look. You're at the helm, I got it. I understand it. I’m all for brothers as head coaches and GMs. We know what battles I’ve been fighting for over 30 years. I got it. </p><p>"But when you don’t get the job done, you don’t get the damn job done. I got it. Don’t tell me it’s just him. Don’t tell me we gonna leave Mike McDaniel in place, and we're just gonna fire him and we're gonna move that. Damn that. I'm waiting for more news.</p><p>"I can't defend Chris Grier. … But I'll be damned if it gets to stop there. Oh, hell no."</p><p>McDaniel has African American ancestry from his grandmother.</p><p>Grier, 55, had been with the organization since 2000 and served as the team’s general manager since 2016.</p><p>"This morning, I made the decision along with general manager Chris Grier to mutually part ways. I have incredible respect for Chris and his family, and I want to thank him for his many contributions to the Miami Dolphins over the last 26 years," Dolphins managing general partner Stephen M. Ross said in a statement.</p><p>"As I assessed the state of the team and in my discussions with Chris, it became clear to both of us that change could not wait. We must improve — in 2025, 2026 and beyond — and it needs to start right now. Champ Kelly will serve as interim general manager effective immediately, and we will begin our search process for a new general manager. I want to thank Champ for stepping up and his commitment to the Dolphins' success this season. There is a lot of football left to play, and we all need to fight even harder."</p><p>In Grier’s nearly decade-long tenure as general manager, he had a 77-80 record with three playoff appearances. They made the playoffs in 2016, 2022 and 2023, and lost in the wild-card round all three times.</p><p><i>Fox News' Ryan Canfield contributed to this report.</i></p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A civil rights organization has filed a complaint alleging that the University of California, Irvine (UCI) is using racial quotas in its engineering school by setting goals to have the number of Black faculty, students and staff "match or exceed" the Black population in California.</p><p>The Equal Protection Project (EPP), founded by Cornell Law School Professor William Jacobson, claims the Samueli School of Engineering is engaging in unlawful race-based practices that violate federal civil rights law and the U.S. Constitution.</p><p>"These racial minimum quota goals are particularly troubling since UC Irvine already is under investigation by the Department of Justice for use of racial quotas in employment and admissions," Jacobson told Fox News Digital in a statement.</p><p>A section of UCI’s Samueli School of Engineering website, which now appears to be offline, read, "We acknowledge the existence of anti-Black racism and prioritizes the campus commitment to create a university culture where Black people thrive. We aim to reflect California’s demographics in our SSoE community by growing our population of Black faculty, students, staff, researchers, and partners to match or exceed the state’s current Black population of 6%."</p><p>The statement appears to set a race-based benchmark for recruitment and hiring, which the EPP argues constitutes a racial quota prohibited under federal law.</p><p>The EPP maintains the quota campaign violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits educational institutions that receive federal funding from discriminating on the basis of race, color or national origin, as well as Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex or gender for entities that receive federal funding.</p><p>The complaint also states that because University of California Irvine is a public school, the offering and promoting of the racial quoting initiative violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p><p>The group is asking the federal government to investigate.</p><p>"The Departments of Education and Justice should examine practices throughout UC Irvine and its Samueli School of Engineering," Jacobson said. Where the institution sets racial minimum quota goals, it is likely there are discriminatory policies and practices throughout the institution. Such systemic discrimination must be addressed by federal authorities, since university officials seem not to care."</p><p>In a statement, a UC Irvine spokesperson said the university "strives to create a learning and working environment where students and employees from all backgrounds are welcome to pursue their academic and professional goals." </p><p>The school added it is reviewing the complaint.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Jacksonville Jaguars' injury report had a surprise name on it on Friday, adding two-way superstar Travis Hunter.</p><p>Head coach Liam Coen told reporters the reigning Heisman Trophy winner suffered a noncontact knee injury, adding he was unsure if Hunter would be able to return to the field this season.</p><p>"We're currently assessing the injury just to determine the best course of action moving forward for Travis and for the team," Coen said. "Feel bad for the guy, for the kid, for our team, for everything. He's in good spirits right now. A minor setback for a major comeback."</p><p></p><p>Hunter delivered a career performance in a loss to the Los Angeles Rams in London. The 2024 Heisman Trophy winner caught eight passes for 101 yards and a touchdown, and the Jaguars (4-3) had been planning to use him as their No. 1 receiver this week at the Las Vegas Raiders (2-5) partly because Brian Thomas Jr. leads the league with nine dropped passes.</p><p>Hunter has played a combined 486 snaps this season, 324 of those coming on offense. He has played 67% of the downs on that side of the ball. He has played 162 snaps on defense, or 36%.</p><p>He has 28 receptions for 298 yards and a score. He also has 15 tackles and three passes defended.</p><p>The Jaguars were already banged up at receiver before Hunter's injury. Thomas (shoulder) and Tim Patrick (groin) were limited participants for the second consecutive day Thursday, and Dyami Brown (shoulder) was a full participant after being limited Wednesday.</p><p>"I have a lot of confidence in these guys," Coen said. "It's a great opportunity for all of us to work through a little adversity and the guys to go out and perform at a high level. It's definitely not ideal timing, not that any injury is ever ideal timing.</p><p>"But you got to believe the mental, the makeup, his general attitude toward life and how he handles dealing with specific situations, I have a lot of belief in Travis as a person, as a competitor to come back better than ever."</p><p>The Jaguars traded up from the No. 5 spot in the NFL Draft to acquire the second overall pick, giving the Cleveland Browns a 2026 first-rounder, to select Hunter, who became a household name as an offensive and defensive superstar at Colorado.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> Military veterans in Congress are criticizing House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., for dodging questions on whether he will forego his paycheck as government workers go without pay due to the ongoing shutdown.</p><p>Reps. Gabe Evans, R-Colo., Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, and Tom Barrett, R-Mich., each of whom served in the U.S. Army, said they would give up their paychecks for the duration of the shutdown, citing concern for American service members.</p><p>The three took aim at Jeffries for delaying saying whether he would do the same.</p><p>As the government shutdown enters its fifth week, Jeffries was asked on CNN on Wednesday night if he would defer his paychecks during the shutdown in light of TSA agents and other federal workers having to work without pay. Jeffries dodged the question, saying, "I’ll be commenting on that shortly."</p><p>While Jeffries' office did not initially give a comment by the time of original publication, a spokesperson later told Fox News Digital that Jeffries would be forgoing his November paycheck. </p><p>On Friday evening, after taking criticism from Republican veterans for dodging questions on his paycheck, Jeffries answered, "I made clear to my constituents that my check will be withheld." </p><p>The spokesperson declined to comment on whether Jeffries had taken his paycheck at the beginning of October. </p><p>Just the day before, Jeffries told CNN, "I understand the sacrifice that people are making, including Capitol Police officers here, and I'm going to conduct myself accordingly given that sacrifice." </p><p>To which the CNN host pressed, "So, that sounds like a yes, that you will defer your paycheck?"</p><p>Jeffries answered, "Well, I'll have more to say about that shortly, but I think consistent with the values that I just articulated."</p><p>In response, Evans, who served as a Black Hawk helicopter pilot, called Jeffries’ dodge an "insult to Americans" that "just reiterates their unserious and irresponsible legislating and proves how out of touch they are from those they are supposed to serve."</p><p>"As a former cop and soldier who still lives paycheck to paycheck, I understand firsthand the severity and impact that this Democrat-led shutdown has caused our country to endure, and is why I’ve chosen to defer my pay and stand in solidarity with every federal employee who misses a paycheck until the Democrats decide to work with Republicans to reopen our government," Evans told Fox News Digital.</p><p>He added that "while thousands of dedicated and hardworking Americans continue to work tirelessly without a paycheck to keep America safe and running, Democrats continue to be noncommittal when asked about deferring their own pay amid the government shutdown."</p><p>Meeks, who retired as a lieutenant colonel, told Fox News Digital that if Jeffries "cared half as much about working families as he does about his own salary, the government would already be open."</p><p>"While 42 million Americans face losing their SNAP benefits and our troops go unpaid, Hakeem Jeffries is still cashing a paycheck," she said.</p><p>"Hakeem Jeffries is so out of touch that he thinks he should be compensated for shutting down the government and causing the American people to suffer," added Barrett, a 22-year veteran.</p><p>"This type of hypocrisy is exactly what I came to Washington to fight against," he said. "It’s time for him to drop this ‘rules for thee and not for me’ attitude and make a decision: pay our federal employees or pass on his paycheck like the rest of us."</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Julia Fox is facing backlash after showing up to a Halloween party dressed as former First Lady Jackie Kennedy in a blood-stained pink suit resembling the one she wore on the day JFK was assassinated.</p><p>The 35-year-old actress and model attended The Cursed Amulet’s Halloween party in New York City on Thursday, wearing a pink wool suit marked with red stains, a pillbox hat, white gloves, a black handbag and a short black wig — an apparent nod to the first lady’s look on Nov. 22, 1963.</p><p>Fox defended her costume choice on Instagram, describing it as a statement about trauma, power and femininity.</p><p>"I’m dressed as Jackie Kennedy in the pink suit. Not as a costume, but as a statement. When her husband was assassinated, she refused to change out of her blood-stained clothes, saying, ‘I want them to see what they’ve done.’ The image of the delicate pink suit splattered with blood is one of the most haunting juxtapositions in modern history. Beauty and horror. Poise and devastation," she wrote in her caption.</p><p>"Her decision not to change clothes, even after being encouraged to, was an act of extraordinary bravery. It was performance, protest, and mourning all at once. A woman weaponizing image and grace to expose brutality. It’s about trauma, power, and how femininity itself is a form of resistance. Long live Jackie O."</p><p>Social media quickly erupted with scathing reactions, saying the costume was offensive.</p><p>"Some people want to leave a mark so bad, they don't care if it's a stain. Very distasteful. Imagine what her family thinks when they see this and have to revisit this horrific day," one comment read.</p><p>Another user wrote, "For her, it was an extraordinary act of bravery.

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating an apparent close call at Boston's Logan Airport Thursday involving a Delta Air Lines flight that was landing and a Cape Air plane that was taking off.</p><p>Delta Flight 263, with 284 passengers and 11 crew members on board, was originally headed from Paris to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, but was forced to divert to Boston because of weather conditions in the New York area, according to Delta officials. </p><p>As the Airbus 330-900neo came in for a landing at Logan at about 4:15 p.m. Eastern Time, air traffic control told the flight crew to "go around" to keep a safe distance from a smaller plane that was taking off, according to audio recorded by LiveATC.net.</p><p>"Air traffic control instructed Delta Air Lines Flight 263 to perform a go-around at Boston Logan International Airport because Cape Air Flight 548 was cleared to takeoff from an intersecting runway," the FAA said in a statement.</p><p>A go-around is a procedure in which a pilot discontinues a landing approach at the direction of air traffic control and returns to altitude, according to the FAA. </p>

<p>In a thrilling end, the Los Angeles Dodgers have forced a Game 7 in the World Series after defeating the Toronto Blue Jays, 3-1. </p><p>It's the first Game 7 in the Fall Classic since the 2019 matchup between the Houston Astros and Washington Nationals.</p><p>The Dodgers will have to steal another game in Toronto to become the first franchise since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees to win consecutive World Series titles. </p><p>After struggling to get on the board in Game 5, the Dodgers' offensive woes continued in the first two innings of the matchup, with Blue Jays pitcher Kevin Gausman striking out four of the first five batters and forcing a groundout from cleanup hitter Mookie Betts.</p><p>The top of the third appeared to be heading the same direction for LA when Gausman struck out Kiké Hernández.

<div class="article-title">Judges say Trump administration must keep paying some SNAP benefits</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington </em>— Two federal judges on Friday said the Trump administration must tap into contingency funds to make payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the <span class="link">government shutdown</span>, ruling against the government in a pair of suits over the imminent benefits lapse. Roughly 42 million Americans <span class="link">rely on SNAP</span> to help buy food.</p><p>In a case brought by a coalition of states in federal court in Massachusetts, Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the government is required by law to tap into the emergency money to make at least partial payments, and gave the administration until Monday to tell the court whether it planned to do so.</p><p>In Rhode Island, another federal judge granted a request for a temporary restraining order from a group of municipalities and nonprofits that sued to block the imminent funding freeze, according to attorneys for Democracy Forward, the group leading the suit. The ruling was made from the bench. An entry on the case docket said the court "orders the USDA to distribute contingency funds" and report back to the court by noon on Monday.</p><p>In her ruling, Talwani stopped short of ordering the administration to send SNAP payments on Saturday, but she rejected the government's argument that the $5 billion contingency fund cannot be used to fund benefits during the lapse in appropriations.</p><p>"At core, Defendants' conclusion that USDA is statutorily prohibited from funding SNAP because Congress has not enacted new appropriations for the current fiscal year is erroneous," Talwani wrote. "To the contrary, Defendants are statutorily mandated to use the previously appropriated SNAP contingency reserve when necessary and also have discretion to use other previously appropriated funds."</p>
<p>Talwani wrote that "the court will allow Defendants to consider whether they will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November, and report back to the court no later than" Monday.</p><p>SNAP benefits provide eligible families with an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card for food purchases. Many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. The Trump administration said money for the program was due to expire on Saturday because of the ongoing government shutdown, now on its 31st day. </p><p>In a post Friday night on Truth Social, President Trump wrote that he has "instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible." The president blamed Democrats for causing any delay to the funding and added, "If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay." </p><p>The suit in Massachusetts was brought by two dozen states and the District of Columbia earlier this week. They asked the court to require the administration to tap into the emergency funds to keep SNAP money flowing to states, which administer food stamp programs. The states argued that the administration's decision to cut off payments was unlawful and threatened to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger. </p>
<p>"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being," state officials wrote in their lawsuit. "Ultimately, the States will bear costs associated with many of these harms. The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems."</p><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, said in a memo last week that "the well has run dry" and that November benefits would not be paid without an end to the shutdown. Administration officials and Republicans in Congress have said that the roughly $5 billion in the contingency fund could not legally be used to cover the shortfall.</p><p>"By law, the contingency fund can only flow when the underlying fund is flowing," Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins <span class="link">said at the Capitol</span> on Friday.</p><p>Talwani, the judge in Massachusetts, rejected that argument in her ruling: "[U]nder Defendants' statutory construction, the use of the separately appropriated contingent reserve to fund SNAP benefits is somehow predicated on Congress's annual appropriation of funds to the SNAP program. Congress placed no such restrictions in the 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act."</p><p>She wrote that the suspension of SNAP payments to the states was "based on the erroneous conclusion that the Contingency Funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments."</p><p>"This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program," the judge wrote. "And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds ... to avoid any reductions." </p>

<p><em>Heflin, Alabama</em> — Every Halloween season, when the sun sets in the small Alabama town of Heflin, the local students from Cleburne County High School toilet paper a few homes. </p><p>But last month, they upped their game, toilet papering just about every business in town, too.</p><p>"It's just fun," one teen told CBS News. </p><p>"And then you don't get caught and it's like, this is fantastic," said another. </p><p>It was fantastic until they made the mistake of hitting the headquarters of the Heflin Police Department.</p>
<p>"It was up on the roof, the spare cars we had in the parking lot ... We had to do something," Heflin Police Chief Ross McGlaughn said.</p><p>So after the "attack" on his station last month, McGlaughn took to social media to send a message to the perpetrators. </p><p>"We think that rolling the police department was a little uncalled for, but as we enter into Halloween season, we dont want to hear any crying when we load up like we are going to serve a search warrant and go full out tactical ninja style old school rolling at your place next month," McGlaughn wrote. "We know who you are and while you just put the play station controller down for a week, we are children of the 80s and 90s who perfected this craft years ago."</p><p>The Heflin Police Department then got to work on an operation that was supported by officers from multiple jurisdictions, all armed to the teeth with toilet paper. </p>
<p>It was an unusual approach to policing, to say the least. But McGlaughn did get permission from the parents in advance. And he said he has his reasons for encouraging the kids like this.</p><p>"As long as they're doing this, they're not getting into trouble doing something else," McGlaughn said. "I haven't seen any types of drugs or alcohol involved. You know, I think they're spending all their money on toilet paper."</p><p>The kids have definitely taken to the prank war. </p><p>"I just think it's good clean fun for everyone, and it's been great for our whole town, the police department and everybody," one student said. </p><p>Heflin's toilet paper war has so tickled the town that businesses are now offering support by putting out free toilet paper. And the kids are taking care of the ensuing mess in their own unique way, by selling insurance.</p><p>"They call it the Toilet Paper Rapid Response Team," McGlaughn said. "So if you buy their insurance and your yard gets rolled, the youth group will come clean it up for you ... So you can buy protection." </p><p>But it's worth it, McGlaughn said, because this has been fun for everyone, including him. </p>
<p>"I'm just rallying everybody," McGlaughn said as he prepared to toilet paper another home. "That way we can hit the next house. It looks beautiful from down there." </p>

<div class="article-title">Low-income families face financial cliff as shutdown threatens aid</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Millions of Americans are sliding toward a financial cliff as the <span class="link">government shutdown</span> stretches into a second month, with four federal assistance programs for low-income families set to <span class="link">run out of funding</span> on Nov. 1.</p><p>Some families could lose access to multiple sources of government support. Ashley Trent, a 37-year-old single mother of six, expressed concern she could soon be without aid provided under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), better known as food stamps, and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, which provides food aid for mothers of young children.</p><p>"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything," Trent, a Bloomington, Ill., resident who works full-time as a housing navigator, told CBS News. "It's very stressful — what bills will I have to put off? I have a car note, I have insurance, I have clothes I have to get my kids because it's getting colder."</p><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds SNAP and WIC, has said it will halt payments for the anti-hunger programs on Nov. 1 due to the <span class="link">government shutdown</span>. Head Start programs serving 65,000 low-income children will also lose federal funding on Saturday, potentially disrupting preschool for thousands of families, according to the National Head Start Association.</p><p>The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps struggling households heat their homes, could be next to run short of funding. </p>
<p>Halting funding for these programs — which help cover food, education, and energy costs — could have lasting consequences for poor families already strained by high grocery and utility prices, said Ailen Arreaza, executive director of the advocacy group ParentsTogether Action. </p><p>Although funding will resume once Congress passes legislation to reopen the government, she warned that the damage to households could persist.</p><p>"What we are hearing from parents is desperation — parents going without meals, making impossible decisions about not paying bills or going without medication," Arreaza told CBS News. "This has so many implications, because these kids need these programs to get ahead."</p><p>Experts note that hunger can hinder children's ability to learn, while parents who fall behind on bills may face utility shutoffs or other lasting setbacks.</p>
<h2>Food stamps</h2><p>The USDA is set to <span class="link">halt SNAP payments on Nov. 1</span>, leaving about 42 million Americans uncertain how they'll afford groceries next month. Recipients receive an average of about $187 a month on prepaid cards that can be used to buy food at grocery stores, farmers' markets and other retailers.</p><p>A prolonged cessation in food-stamp funding isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday that the Trump administration is required by law to <span class="link">use contingency funds</span> to pay at least partial SNAP benefits. The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments. </p><p>Meanwhile, more than a dozen states are trying to fill the gap by using state funds to support food aid or local food banks. But food bank leaders say charities can't make up for a cutoff in food stamps. </p><p>"It's going to hurt us really bad," said Taylour Grant, 29, a Tampa medical assistant who relies on $970 a month in SNAP benefits to feed her four children, plus WIC support for her youngest, who is 1-year-old. "It's really scary because I know I'll go without to make sure my kids are fed."</p><p>Grant said many people misunderstand who relies on SNAP. "We're not on it because we want to be — no one makes enough to live off these days. That help is really needed," she said.</p><h2>WIC</h2><p>Nearly 7 million low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children under 5 who receive WIC could lose federal aid in November because of the government shutdown. </p><p>Unlike food stamps, WIC provides funds specifically to purchase formula and nutritious foods for pregnant women and young children, though many families rely on both programs, said Georgia Machell, CEO of the National WIC Association.</p>
<p>"None of these programs operate in a vacuum," she said. "Often, if a family is participating in WIC, they're also participating in SNAP."</p><p>WIC continued paying benefits in October after the Trump administration tapped $300 million in leftover tariff revenue from the previous fiscal year. But with the stalemate in Congress continuing into November, that funding could run out. </p><p>The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it could tap additional tariff revenue to fund the program. At this point, the program is set to delay payments on Nov. 1, according to the National WIC Association.</p><p>WIC has been able to maintain funding during previous shutdowns in its 50-year history, according to the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on stopping hunger. "The disruptions we're concerned about would be fairly historic," Machell said.</p><p>Some states have pledged to use their own funds to keep WIC running, but many lack the budget, according to FRAC. </p><h2>Head Start</h2><p>About 140 Head Start programs in 41 states and Puerto Rico will lose federal funding with the shutdown set to extend past Nov. 1, affecting roughly 65,000 children, according to the National Head Start Association. Nationwide, about 750,000 children are enrolled in Head Start.</p><p>Some programs may not be able to stay open, regional program directors warn.</p>
<p>"Everybody is trying to do everything they can to keep children in classrooms and families at work," Michelle Haimowitz, executive director of the Massachusetts Head Start Association, <span class="link">told CBS News Boston</span>. "But it is incredibly difficult to operate without those federal funds." </p><p>Minnesota mother Jaycee Chrudimsky said she fears that the closure of her local Head Start program could force her to miss work and affect her 4-year-old daughter.</p><p>"It would impact her, and that's the thing I worry about the most, because she looks forward to coming to school every single day and seeing her friends and being a part of the program," Chrudimsky <span class="link">told</span> CBS News Minnesota this week. </p><h2>LIHEAP</h2><p>Another program threatened by the shutdown is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The program helps about 6 million low-income households pay their energy bills.</p><p>"We are now at a point where the government shutdown is going to cause serious delays in the release of LIHEAP funds," Wolfe told CBS News.</p><p>The delay could leave millions of families behind on utility bills and facing power shutoffs just as <span class="link">energy prices are skyrocketing</span>, he added.</p><p>NEADA projects the <span class="link">average cost for people to heat a home this winter</span> will rise nearly 8%.</p>
<p>"It's a perfect storm of misery for low- and middle-income households," Wolfe said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump sets lowest refugee cap in U.S. history at 7,500, mostly for Afrikaners</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Trump administration on Thursday announced it would set the lowest refugee admissions cap in U.S. history, allocating just 7,500 spots for this fiscal year, mostly for Afrikaners who it has claimed are facing racial discrimination in South Africa for being White.</p><p>The previous lowest refugee ceiling was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.</p><p>The announcement Thursday is the latest effort by Mr. Trump and his top aides to dramatically scale back the decades-old U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, a humanitarian policy for vulnerable people fleeing war and violence across the world that once enjoyed robust bipartisan support.</p><p>Mr. Trump suspended the U.S. refugee program hours after taking office for a second time earlier this year, citing strains on American communities receiving the refugees and concerns about the vetting process. Weeks later, his administration made an exemption for Afrikaners, calling them victims of racial oppression. </p><p>In an order posted on the federal government's journal of regulations, Mr. Trump said the 7,500 refugee spots for fiscal year 2026 would "primarily be allocated among Afrikaners" and "other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands." Fiscal year 2026 started on Oct. 1 and culminates at the end of September 2026.</p>
<p>The South African government has vehemently denied Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted. Before the 1990s, White South Africans enforced a brutal system of apartheid over the country's Black majority. </p><p>Afrikaners are an ethnic group in South Africa made up of descendants of European settlers and colonists, mostly from the Netherlands, who first arrived there in the 1600s. The Trump administration <span class="link">welcomed</span> the first group of Afrikaners granted refugee status in May.</p>
<p>The prioritization of Afrikaners — while refugees from places like Afghanistan, Myanmar and Sudan plagued by ethnic violence and armed conflict are being blocked from entering the U.S. — has led to accusations of preferential treatment among refugee advocates. </p><p>Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, one of several national groups that traditionally have worked with the U.S. government to resettle refugees, said Mr. Trump's decision "lowers our moral standing."</p>
<p>"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program's purpose as well as its credibility," she added.</p><p>Officially created in 1980, the U.S. refugee program was designed to offer a safe harbor to people abroad fleeing persecution because of their race, religion, political views or membership in a social group. </p><p>Before the second Trump administration took office, refugees were typically referred to the U.S. by United Nations officials and spent months or years in third-party countries undergoing interviews, as well as security and medical checks, before being granted entry into the U.S. The process is distinct from the asylum system, which can be accessed by foreigners already on American soil, including those who enter the U.S. illegally.</p><p>Over the past decades, most of those admitted into the U.S. as refugees have come from countries in Africa and Asia plagued by war, ethnic strife or repression of minority groups, State Department figures show.</p><p>After refugee admissions plummeted to a record low of 11,000 in fiscal year 2021 — mostly due to Trump-era cuts and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic — the Biden administration dramatically expanded the program. </p><p>In fiscal year 2024, the Biden administration welcomed more than 100,000 refugees, the highest level since the 1990s, according to government data. Officials stopped publishing refugee admissions data after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>FBI Director Kash Patel says a "potential terrorist attack," allegedly targeting Halloween weekend in Michigan, was thwarted by the FBI on Friday morning.</p><p>Five people between the ages of 16 and 20 were arrested Friday, CBS News has learned. Authorities say they were inspired by a former member of the Michigan Army National Guard who was arrested in May for allegedly <span class="link">planning an ISIS-inspired attack</span> against a U.S. Army site in suburban Detroit. Ammar Abdulmajid-Mohamed Said, 19, was accused of providing support for a planned attack on the U.S. Army's Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command facility at the Detroit Arsenal. </p><p>One or more members of the group of five young people arrested Friday may have known Said, law enforcement sources told CBS News.</p><p>The plot, however, was not well formed, and the FBI was monitoring an online discussion about the plot for a period of time. There was no concrete plan for an attack.</p><p>"Through swift action and close coordination with our local partners, a potential act of terror was stopped before it could unfold," Patel said in a statement on social media. "The vigilance of this FBI prevented what could have been a tragic attack — and thanks to their dedication, Michigan will have a safe and happy Halloween."</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the FBI field office in Detroit told CBS News that FBI agents were in the cities of Dearborn and Inkster on Friday, "conducting law enforcement activities." They did not offer any additional information on the investigation but said there is "no current threat to public safety."</p><p>The law enforcement source said an FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force member had apparently uncovered two teenagers on an online ISIS chat room in some kind of discussion, but that no real plot materialized.</p><p>Members of the FBI task force were photographed outside a home in Dearborn on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Sources said the FBI had not shared specific details of the operation with Dearborn city authorities, but city officials were informed a few hours in advance that an operation would be conducted in the neighborhood where it occurred.</p>
<p>The Dearborn Police Department said in a post on Facebook that it's aware the FBI conducted operations in the city on Friday morning.</p><p>"We want to assure our residents that there is no threat to the community at this time," the police department's post said.</p><p>Dearborn borders Detroit, about 7 miles west of downtown. Inkster is a suburb located about 12 miles west of downtown Detroit.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Powder supplements sold at Sam's Club stores are linked to at least 11 cases of Salmonella in seven states, federal health authorities said Friday.  </p><p>Member's Mark Super Greens Powder Supplements, which were sold at the discount chain's stores nationwide and online, have been pulled from store shelves because they contain moringa leaf powder that may be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an alert posted on its website. </p><p>"If you have any of the products listed below in your home, throw them out or return them to the store," the agency said, while noting that the product has not been recalled.  </p><p>Three of the people who contracted Salmonella were hospitalized, according to the agency. Illnesses, which were reported between May and September, were confirmed in Florida, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, South Carolina and Virginia. </p><p>The source of the Salmonella was traced to a single lot of organic moringa leaf powder imported from Vallon Farm Direct in Jodhpur, India, according to an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration. State health officials in Virginia and Michigan collected and tested samples of the product from the homes of people who fell ill. </p>
<p>The CDC said it may add other Vallon Farm products with moringa leaf powder to avoid as the agency's investigation continues. </p><p>Moringa is a plant native to India and other countries prized for essential nutrients including protein, amino acids, vitamins and minerals, according to research published by the National Institutes of Health. Its leaves can be dried and powdered.</p><p>People infected with the Salmonella bacteria can experience symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever. Rarely, Salmonella can result in more serious ailments, including arterial infections, endocarditis, arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation and urinary tract symptoms. </p><p>Infections can be severe in young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems, who may require hospitalization.</p>

<section class="content__body">
<p>A federal appeals court in Chicago has ruled that Border Patrol Commander-At-Large Gregory Bovino does not have to attend daily meetings with a judge to discuss federal immigration agents' use of force in Chicago, as the judge had ordered earlier this week.</p><p>A three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis' order for Bovino to attend daily hearings in her courtroom would place her "in the position of an inquisitor rather than that of a neutral adjudicator" of an ongoing lawsuit over immigration agents' tactics.</p><p>They also said Ellis' order "sets the court up as a supervisor of Chief Bovino's activities, intruding into personnel management decisions of the Executive Branch. These two problems are related and lead us to conclude that the order infringes on the separation of powers."  </p><p>Ellis ordered the meetings <span class="link">after a hearing on Tuesday</span> in federal court over claims that Bovino and other federal agents violated a temporary restraining order largely prohibiting the use of tear gas and other riot control measures on journalists, protesters, and clergy <span class="link">during Operation Midway Blitz</span> in Chicago.  </p><p>In response to numerous filings regarding alleged violations of that order, Ellis instructed Bovino to meet with her every weekday evening to go over the events of the day until a preliminary injunction hearing on Nov. 5. The appeals court <span class="link">temporarily blocked that order on Wednesday</span>, a short time before the first scheduled meeting with Bovino. Friday's ruling permanently blocks those meetings.</p>
<p>In appealing Ellis' order,, lawyers for the government had argued the order "far exceeds the recognized bounds of discovery" and "significantly interferes" with Bovino's function, which the government argues is "ensuring the Nation's immigration laws are properly enforced."</p><p>They also argued the meetings are "untethered to the plaintiffs' underlying claims" and go beyond reasonable necessity to comply with the court orders already in place.</p><p>Meantime, was at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse for a second day of questioning as part of a five-hour deposition in connection to the lawsuit over federal agents' tactics. Friday's deposition focused on agents' use of force, and body camera video footage the Department of Homeland Security must turn over as part of the lawsuit.</p>

<div class="article-title">Epstein cultivated celebrity relationships, even as his 2019 arrest neared</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Many of the famous and powerful people who have long sought to publicly downplay their connections to <span class="link">Jeffrey Epstein</span> in fact had more involved relationships than they've acknowledged, according to documents recently made public by Congress.  </p><p>Detailed calendars, daily schedules and flight manifests were among more than 8,000 pages of documents reviewed by CBS News, providing a glimpse into Epstein's habits and relationships.   </p><p>Some of those relationships spanned years and involved dozens of meetings, events, meals and travel, and now records of those interactions are spilling out into public view. Several prominent people continued to spend time with Epstein up until his arrest in 2019, even as sex trafficking accusations intensified after his 2008 "sweetheart deal" with prosecutors in Florida, which allowed Epstein to maintain his jet-set status relatively unscathed.    </p><p>The exact nature of the relationships are hard, if not impossible, to characterize based on the documents. What is clear is that Epstein's life had many dimensions beyond his criminal activity — including complex financial transactions and philanthropic activity that would have attracted many suitors. And he appears to have been a prolific networker.     </p><p>Among those spending considerable time in <span class="link">Epstein's orbit</span> was filmmaker Woody Allen, who has said previously that his ties to Epstein were limited to social events at Epstein's home, always with Allen's wife present. Another recurring contact, Kathryn Ruemmler, a Goldman Sachs executive who was President Barack Obama's White House counsel, has said she only met with Epstein in a professional capacity.   </p>
<p>Appointment calendars through 2019 show several meetings with self-help guru Deepak Chopra and longevity expert Dr. Peter Attia. Details from Epstein's appointments during the final two years of his life had not previously been made public. They show he continued to plan meetings with people like political strategist Steve Bannon and Hyatt executive chairman Tom Pritzker.  </p><h2>  A love of cinema, with Woody Allen friendship at forefront  </h2><p>Film screenings appear frequently on Epstein's calendar. He'd attend them and would also invite friends to watch movies in his home screening room. Among the most frequent of Epstein's social companions in the years leading up to <span class="link">his death</span> was filmmaker Woody Allen and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn. Epstein often went to Manhattan Film Center on Park Avenue in New York City to screen Allen's movies or watch him edit, documents show.   </p><p>The records show nearly 100 instances between 2014 and 2019 in which Allen and Epstein — almost always joined by Allen's wife — were scheduled to meet or spend time together. The documents show that Allen and Previn were among Epstein's most regular social companions during that period.  </p><p>A spokesperson for Allen told the Wall Street Journal in 2023 he "never had a business meeting with Epstein and not once spent time with him without Soon-Yi also being present."    </p>
<p>When contacted by CBS News about the most recent calendar entries in Epstein's diary through 2019, Allen's spokesperson said no comment would be provided.   </p>
<p>Epstein's calendar notes travel with Allen and Previn at least nine times, including to his ranch in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and to his residence in Palm Beach, Florida. No allegations have been made that Allen or Previn knew about or were involved in any wrongdoing. In interviews, Allen has said that Epstein always had a girlfriend around him, but he did not believe those women were underage. </p><p>A source familiar with the flight logs told CBS News that some of the flights with Allen and Previn also include the names of known victims who frequently traveled with Epstein, but those passenger names are redacted in the logs that were released.   </p><p>Allen provided film editing lessons to Epstein and others, according to Epstein's calendar. The calendar has a scheduled visit with Allen to the artist Jeff Koons' studio in New Jersey, though Koons told CBS News the visit never occurred. Epstein visited film sets where Allen was directing in New York and Rhode Island. Allen, Previn and Epstein were even scheduled to have dinner together on Valentine's Day in Paris one year.   </p><p>Epstein, Allen and Previn's final dinner together was May 9, 2019; the guest list included Kathy Ruemmler and another guest. Two months later, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport on federal sex trafficking charges.   </p><h2>  Politics and business mixed in Epstein's calendar  </h2><p>Epstein was known for being a connector; he frequently met with executives, CEOs and CFOs, and helped bring others together. On his calendar, he had meetings with business titans such as Barry Sternlicht, president of Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts, although a spokesperson for Sternlicht told CBS News the meeting never happened and he only attended one group dinner. He was scheduled to meet with Hyatt's Tom Pritzker 28 times between 2013 and 2018. Billionaire banker Ariane de Rothschild and the investor Leon Black and were also listed.  </p><p>Epstein also pulled politicians and operatives into the mix. The late New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson maintained a relationship with Epstein at least through Sept. 19, 2016, when they were scheduled to meet for dinner. He appears on Epstein's calendar and flight logs showing travel to Epstein's New Mexico ranch.   </p>
<p>A previously unreported log shows Richardson travelled in 2011 on Epstein's helicopter from the British Virgin Islands to the U.S. Virgin Islands. That flight log also lists Epstein and Brian Condit, Richardson's chief of staff, as a passenger, as well as three of Epstein's alleged victims, as identified by the House Oversight Committee, one with U.K. citizenship and two U.S. citizens.   </p><p>Condit told CBS News the chopper flight was from Richard Branson's island to the U.S. Virgin Islands. They did not visit the private property Epstein owned there, he said.  He doesn't remember who else was on the helicopter. Richardson died at age 75 in 2023.  </p><p>Epstein was also in frequent contact with Ruemmler, the former Obama White House counsel who is currently chief legal officer and general counsel at the world's largest investment bank, Goldman Sachs<strong>. </strong>Shehas previously said, "I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein."  </p>
<p>Ruemmler was a partner at the law firm Latham &amp; Watkins during the period she spent time with Epstein. Known for courting powerful people, Epstein often helped arrange business relationships. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs has said previously that was the extent of Ruemmler's cultivation of Epstein, leveraging him for business contacts and referrals.   </p><p>Epstein's calendar shows dozens of scheduled meetings and events involving Ruemmler. One note, for Feb. 6, 2018, says, "Kathy Ruemmler to have the Glam Squad to her NY apt for 9am!" It's unclear why Epstein was making note of the apparent hair and makeup appointment. Ruemmler declined to comment for this story.   </p><p>A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs told CBS News, "As we've said before, and has been repeatedly reported, Ms. Ruemmler had a professional relationship with Mr. Epstein when she was the global chair of the white collar defense and investigations practice at Latham &amp; Watkins."   </p><p>"He referred business to her and they shared a common client that originated as an Epstein referral," the spokesperson said.  </p>
<p>Their more than 50 scheduled meetings included appointments in Paris and St. Lucia and gatherings with some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world, including tech billionaire Peter Thiel, Bill Gates, former Sen. Bob Kerrey and Bannon. A spokesperson for Ruemmler denied she had ever flown with him and said she never met with Epstein outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>Epstein's appointment calendar does not specify a purpose for his meetings with Bannon, a former White House chief strategist in the first Trump administration. Bannon has since said he filmed hours of interviews with Epstein as part of a planned documentary. A source who was close to Epstein in his final weeks told CBS News that Epstein was eager to portray himself in a redemptive light.  </p><p>Epstein's schedule remained packed with powerful and famous people even as federal agents closed in. In one week in April 2019, three months before his arrest, Epstein's calendar included meetings with Ruemmler, Bannon, investment banker and commentator Robert Kuhn and lunch with Chopra. Ruemmler's last appointments with Epstein were on May 6 and May 7, 2019.   </p><h2>  An obsession with longevity and medicine  </h2><p>Epstein had a deep interest in medicine, science and longevity, both on a personal level and for business. Records obtained by CBS News show he had planned as early as 2012 to launch a company focused on gene sequencing.   </p><p>Chopra, the physician and prominent integrative medicine advocate, appears in Epstein's calendar at least a dozen times in 2016, 2017 and 2019.   </p><p>They were scheduled to meet one-on-one on some occasions — including at least one appointment in Paris in November 2016 — and in groups on other dates. Epstein was invited to a 25th anniversary event for Skeptic Magazine, in which Chopra was featured as a discussion panelist. Two months later, Epstein invited Chopra to a dinner with Allen and his wife.   </p><p>Chopra told CBS News in a statement, "Jeffrey Epstein was introduced to me by Barnaby Marsh, former CEO of the Templeton Foundation, as someone who could potentially fund research on the brain and consciousness."   </p><p>Chopra said their appointments were primarily related to treatment for Epstein's struggles with sleep.   </p>
<p>"After meeting, he shared he suffered from insomnia and expressed interest in learning meditation, which I taught him. Our meetings, focused solely on practicing meditation, lasted about 30 minutes each," Chopra said. "At my suggestion, he also visited Dr. V.S. Ramachandran's lab at [the University of California San Diego] to learn about ongoing brain research.  </p><p>"While several of these institutions had received some funding from him, no projects were ever initiated as a result of our interactions.

<div class="article-title">Get ready to fall back: Daylight saving time ends this weekend</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Daylight saving time is coming to an end for 2025. This Sunday, Nov. 2, clocks "fall back" and we gain an hour. Here's what to know about the seasonal time change.</p><h2>When does the time change for the end of daylight saving 2025?</h2><p>Daylight saving time comes to an end on Sunday, Nov. 2, at 2 a.m., when the time goes back to 1 a.m.  </p><p>Daylight saving time <span class="link">began last spring</span> on March 9. Clocks will "spring forward" next year on March 8, 2026, when daylight saving time returns.</p><h2>Do we lose or gain an hour when daylight saving time ends?</h2><p>People will gain an hour as clocks fall back on Sunday. For most Americans, that means an extra hour of sleep.</p><p>Many digital clocks will automatically reset overnight, but remember to change any watches or clocks that need to be manually adjusted.</p>
<p>After the time change, darkness will arrive earlier in the evening, and sunrise in the morning will also come earlier.</p><h2>Why was daylight saving created in the first place?</h2><p>Annual clock changes have been around for decades, but the <span class="link">origins of the practice</span> remain something of a mystery. People have pointed toward farmers wanting more daylight or cited various proponents of getting up earlier in the day, but some of those theories are disputed.</p><p>Germany began observing daylight saving time in 1916 during World War I, with the thought that it would save energy. Other European countries and the U.S. followed suit in the next few years.</p><p>There was some debate around the practice in the decades that followed, but eventually, daylight saving time was enacted in the U.S. as a legal requirement by the Uniform Time Act of 1966, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. </p>
<h2>Which states don't do daylight saving time?</h2><p>While clocks will change for most of the U.S., there are two states and several territories that do not observe daylight saving time. <span class="link">Clocks will not change</span> in Hawaii or Arizona (except for in Navajo Nation), American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to the Department of Transportation, which oversees the nation's time zones</p><p>States can opt out of observing daylight saving time, but they cannot choose to permanently be on daylight saving time.</p><p>Most countries around the world do not observe daylight saving, with the U.S. and most of Europe being the exception rather than the rule, according to Pew Research Center. Among countries that do change their clocks, most of them rolled back an hour in October, according to timeanddate.com.</p><h2>The debate over daylight saving time today</h2><p>A 2022 CBS News/YouGov poll <span class="link">found</span> that nearly 80% of Americans supported changing the current system, with more Americans preferring daylight saving time to standard time.</p><p>That same year, the <span class="link">Senate passed a bill</span> called the Sunshine Protection Act that would have made daylight saving time permanent, but it never advanced in the House of Representatives.</p><p>President Trump, before his return to office for his second term, said he'd <span class="link">push to eliminate the time change</span>.</p><p>"The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't! Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation," he wrote on Truth Social in December of last year.</p>
<p>While his December comment called for the elimination of daylight saving time, Mr. Trump has, in the past, called for <span class="link">permanent</span> daylight saving — that is, keeping clocks shifted one hour ahead.</p><p>There have been a number of studies finding that changing clocks twice a year can be <span class="link">disruptive for people's health</span>. In addition to impacting mood and mental health, researchers at Stanford Medicine this year said that falling back and springing forward may lead to an increase in heart attacks, obesity and strokes.</p>

<div class="article-title">Dodgers force World Series to decisive Game 7 by holding off Blue Jays 3-1</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>TORONTO — Yoshinobu Yamamoto beat Toronto for the second time in a week, slumping Mookie Betts hit a two-run single in a three-run third inning and the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers held off the Blue Jays 3-1 on Friday night to force the World Series to a decisive Game 7.</p> <p>Yamamoto was not quite as sharp as in his Game 2 four-hitter, the first World Series complete game in a decade. He lasted six innings and allowed an RBI single in the third by George Springer, who returned after missing two games with an injury to his right side.</p>
<p>Rookie relievers Justin Wrobleski and Roki Sasaki combined for six outs before starter Tyler Glasnow came out of the bullpen to escape a ninth-inning jam and rescue the Dodgers.</p> <p>Glasnow needed only three pitches to do it. With runners on second and third and nobody out, he got Ernie Clement to pop up his first delivery on the infield for an easy out. Andrés Giménez then hit a line drive to left field that Kiké Hernández turned into a game-ending double play.</p> <p>Hernández caught the ball on the run in shallow left-center and fired to second base, where Miguel Rojas made a tough pick of a one-hop throw to double off Addison Barger.</p> <p>"I was playing a little more shallow than the card wanted me to. But given the situation, really fast guy at second base, I was like, you know what? I'm going to play really, really shallow. If he hits it over my head, kudos to him. I feel like his pop is more to the pull side," Hernández said.</p> <p>"Somehow I was able to hear that the bat broke even with that crowd. The crazy thing is I had no idea where the ball was because it was in the lights the whole time. But given the situation in the game, the World Series on the line and how good I was hitting tonight, I was like, it's going to hit me in the face — but I'm not stopping. I'm not pulling up. And at the very end, the ball came out of the lights and went into my glove."</p>
<p>It was the first 7-4 game-ending double play in postseason history, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.</p> <p>"I gave him a really hard throw to catch. I think it was a better pick than it was a play on my end," Hernández said.</p> <p>Sasaki plunked Alejandro Kirk with an 0-2 pitch to begin the inning, and Barger hit a ground-rule double to left-center that got wedged at the bottom of the wall.</p> <p>That's when Dodgers manager Dave Roberts summoned Glasnow.</p> <p>"I just felt right there, Roki wasn't as sharp and I felt right there, Glas is a guy who has swing-and-miss stuff and I just wanted to bet on him," Roberts said. "He's been chomping at the bit to make an impact."</p>
<p>Max Scherzer will start Game 7 on Saturday night for the Blue Jays. The three-time Cy Young Award winner also started the last World Series Game 7, getting a no-decision when Washington won the 2019 title over Houston.</p> <p>"These guys are really good at kind of just turning the page," Toronto manager John Schneider said. "That will take a while to kind of unpack. That's a wild ending. I love the way we played."</p> <p>Glasnow had been lined up to potentially start for the Dodgers, seeking to become the first team to win consecutive titles since the New York Yankees won three straight from 1998-2000. Two-way star Shohei Ohtani also could be used as an opener.</p> <p>"I think right now, there's no wrong answer," Roberts said. "He's certainly going to be a part of the pitching plan, and with Shohei, it could be two innings, but it could be four innings. So I'm not sure where we're going to slot him. We're going to have to talk to him first on where he feels most comfortable."</p> <p>Los Angeles kept alive its bid for a third title in six seasons and its hopes to be recognized as a dynasty.</p>
<p>"Man, we live for Game 7, so here we go," Roberts said.</p> <p>Yamamoto, a 27-year-old right-hander in his second season with the Dodgers after winning three MVP awards in Japan, was coming off the first consecutive postseason complete games since 2001.</p> <p>He allowed one run and five hits with six strikeouts and a walk, stranding two runners in the sixth when he struck out Daulton Varsho with a splitter on his 96th and final pitch. Yamamoto is 4-1 with a 1.56 ERA in five postseason starts and has a 1.20 ERA in his two Series outings.</p> <p>Kevin Gausman lost to Yamamoto for the second time despite matching a Series record by striking out eight in the first three innings behind a dominant splitter.</p> <p>Tommy Edman doubled with one out in the third for the Dodgers' first hit. Ohtani was intentionally walked for the fifth time in the Series and Will Smith hit an RBI double off the left-field wall on a high splitter.</p> <p>Freddie Freeman walked, bringing up Betts. The three-time World Series champion entered just 3 for 23 in the Series and had been dropped from second to third in the lineup for Game 5. He was moved down another slot to cleanup Friday, his lowest in the batting order since 2017.</p>
<p>Behind 1-2 in the count, Betts fouled off two pitches and laced Gausman's third straight fastball between shortstop and third for a 3-0 lead. That ended an 0-for-13 stretch with the bases loaded for the Dodgers that dated to the Division Series.</p> <p>"Honestly, man, I know it hasn't been great for me," Betts said. "But this year really hasn't been great. I just want to be there to help the boys. I came up in a big spot. ... I just was able to find a way to lock in."</p> <p>Seeking their first World Series title since 1993, the Blue Jays wore powder blue uniforms at home for the first time since September after getting wins with them in Games 4 and 5 in LA.</p>
<p>Toronto scored when Barger doubled to start the third and came around on Springer's two-out single.</p> <p>Gausman gave up three runs and six hits in six innings, getting 15 swings and misses with his splitter.</p> <p>Sasaki, a starter turned reliever as the Dodgers tried to shore up their bullpen, escaped a two-on, one-out jam in the eighth by retiring Bo Bichette on a foulout and Varsho on a groundout.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Up next</h3> <p>Scherzer and Glasnow started Game 3, won by the Dodgers 6-5 in 18 innings. A 41-year-old right-hander, Scherzer will become the fourth pitcher to start multiple World Series winner-take-all Game 7s after Bob Gibson (1964, '67, '68), Lew Burdette and Don Larsen (both 1957 and '58). Scherzer allowed two runs over five innings for Washington against Houston in 2019, and the Nationals rallied for a 6-2 win.</p>

<div class="article-title">Pakistan and Afghanistan agree to maintain a ceasefire -- for now. Here's what to know</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — After five days of on-and-off talks in Istanbul to resolve hostilities that flared in the first half of October, Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to continue a ceasefire they arrived at earlier this month, Turkey's Foreign Ministry announced Thursday. </p> <p>In a statement, the ministry said the next round of talks would take place on Nov. 6: "All parties have agreed to put in place a monitoring and verification mechanism that will ensure maintenance of peace and imposing penalty on the violating party."  </p> <p>The ceasefire came after more than a week of cross-border gunfire and targeted strikes inside Afghanistan killed dozens on both sides, including civilians. The agreement put a pause on the most intense fighting between the two countries in years.</p>
<p>Trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan has ground to a halt as major border crossings remain closed. Analysts warn that the conflict, which has deep roots, could reignite and destabilize the region. Here's what to know.</p> <h3 class="edTag">What's at stake?</h3> <p>The main issue between the neighboring countries is rising militancy in Pakistan's mountainous borderlands, where the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, has ramped up attacks in the years since the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021, following the withdrawal of U.S. forces. The TTP is closely aligned with the Afghan Taliban, and Pakistan accuses Afghanistan's Taliban rulers of providing them a base and failing to rein them in when they orchestrate deadly attacks in Pakistan — all of which Afghanistan's Taliban denies.</p> <p>Each country blamed the other for a breakdown in talks earlier this week. In a post on X, Pakistan's Information Minister Ataullah Tarar said Afghanistan's Taliban "have always remained indifferent to Pakistan's losses. ... Pakistan's patience has run its course." Afghan state broadcaster RTA accused Pakistan of "irrational demands."</p>
<p>Pakistan's increasingly bold military actions inside Afghanistan reflect its hardening stance toward cross-border militant groups, says Muhammad Amir Rana, director of Islamabad's Pak Institute for Peace Studies, an independent think tank. "This is signaling to the [Afghan] Taliban that if you haven't changed your attitudes or policies supporting the TTP and other terrorist organizations inside Pakistan, Pakistan can retaliate," he says.</p> <h3 class="edTag">What sparked this month's fighting?</h3> <p>The conflict began after TTP militants ambushed a Pakistani army convoy on Oct. 8, killing 11 soldiers near the Afghan border. The TTP aims to overthrow the Pakistani government and impose hardline Islamic rule, as the Taliban did in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Afghanistan then blamed Pakistan for multiple strikes inside its territory on Oct. 9, including in its capital, Kabul. Pakistan has neither officially confirmed nor denied carrying out the strikes. Two nights later, Afghan forces fired at Pakistan's border posts in retaliation, leading to back-and-forth gunfire along the border. Cross-border fighting flared up again days later, before both sides agreed to an initial truce, which was later extended in Doha, Qatar, on Oct. 19.  </p> <p>Before ceasefire talks began in Doha, Pakistan also launched what security officials called targeted strikes against militants in Afghanistan's eastern province of Paktika.</p> <p>Up to now, talks with the Taliban about the TTP have yielded little for Pakistan, analysts say. "Pakistani attempts to talk to the Taliban to convince them to do something against the TTP have failed," says Abdul Basit, senior associate fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.</p>
<p>Islamabad has also tried to pressure the Taliban by deporting Afghan refugees.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Who are the Pakistani Taliban?</h3> <p>The TTP emerged in 2007 in response to Pakistan's military support of the U.S. fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan. It has primarily targeted Pakistani security personnel in recent years, but also has claimed responsibility for horrific attacks on civilians, including one in 2014 that killed more than 100 Pakistani schoolchildren. Its fighters share close ideological ties and battlefield experience with Afghanistan's Taliban.</p> <p>The group has seen a revival in the past four years, after counterterrorism campaigns significantly weakened it around a decade ago.  An independent conflict monitor found the TTP was behind 600 attacks against Pakistani security forces in the past year alone. That's compared to an estimated 67 attacks the year before the Taliban took power in Afghanistan, according to the Pak Institute for Peace Studies.</p> <p>Pakistan has been closely connected to the Taliban since it cultivated the Afghan group in the 1990s. It was accused of covertly supporting the Taliban through the U.S. war in Afghanistan, something Islamabad denies.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">How might this play out?</h3> <p>President Trump said earlier this week on the sidelines of a regional summit in Malaysia that the conflict would be an easy fix. "I heard that Pakistan and Afghanistan have started up, but I'll get that solved very quickly," he said. </p> <p>In a post on X, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Thursday that Afghanistan, "like other neighboring countries, also desires positive relations with Pakistan and it adheres to the principles of mutual respect, non-interference in internal affairs, and not posing a threat to anyone."</p> <p>Earlier this year, Pakistan and Afghanistan held a trilateral meeting with China to discuss issues including counterterrorism and trade, raising hopes of better relations. But ties are meanwhile growing between Afghanistan and India, Pakistan's eastern neighbor and rival. </p> <p>Asif, Pakistan's defense minister, said this week that "Kabul is a tool for Delhi." This month's Pakistan-Afghanistan fighting coincided with the Taliban foreign minister's first official visit to India.</p> <p>"It's not for a lack of diplomacy or dialogue that we are where we are right now," says Asfandyar Mir, senior fellow for South Asia at the Stimson Center in Washington, D.C. The current ceasefire, he says, suggests that for now, Pakistan has been able to corner the Taliban with its military escalation. But he expects the Taliban to continue tacitly supporting the TTP by stalling on Pakistani requests to act against the group in Afghanistan.</p> <p>He says the Afghan Taliban's support for the TTP is a continued source of regional instability that could lead to more attacks by the group in Pakistan and more intense military action by Pakistan inside Afghanistan.</p> <p>Basit, from Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, puts it starkly: "Border tensions will play out at a new level," he warns. "If they were simmering, now they will be boiling."</p>

<div class="article-title">Federal judges order administration to pay SNAP benefits but what's next remains unclear</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide SNAP benefits for the 42 million people who rely on the program to feed their families.</p> <p>But it was unclear hours after the rulings Friday afternoon how much assistance may be provided or when it might come.</p> <p>U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston ruled the Trump administration has until Monday to decide whether to pay at least partial SNAP food benefits. She declined to issue a temporary restraining order to force the administration to act before the funds run out tomorrow, finding that resuming payments at some point can still avoid irreparable harm to SNAP recipients.</p>
<p>In Rhode Island, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. granted a temporary restraining order while saying ending SNAP payments would harm not only people, but also local economies. The judge said the Trump administration "must distribute" aid from emergency reserves as soon as possible. He also said it must submit a plan on how it would comply with his order, or "at least an update," by noon on Monday, Ocean State Media reported.</p> <p>It is not yet clear how the two court orders would impact the flow of benefits, which are set to run out Saturday.</p> <p>Hours after the rulings, President Trump posted on social media that he has directed government lawyers to find a way to pay SNAP benefits. "If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay," he wrote. However, it's not clear what sort of legal direction the administration was seeking.</p> <p>The Trump administration had said it did not have enough money to pay November's SNAP benefits because of the government shutdown and that it lacked legal authority to use contingency funds set aside for emergencies.</p>
<p>Talwani acknowledged her order would leave millions of people without assistance starting Saturday. She issued her decision in a case filed by two dozen Democratic-led states that sued over the administration's decision to suspend the nation's largest anti-hunger program for the first time in its history.</p> <p>The judge said the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, must use emergency funds to keep SNAP going. She also said other money is legally available but left the decision of how much benefits to distribute up to the administration.</p>
<p>In Rhode Island, McConnell issued his decision in a lawsuit filed by eight cities and nonprofit and business groups.</p> <p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, helps 1 in 8 U.S. residents, who get an average of $186 a month.</p>

<div class="article-title">What does '67' mean? Dictionary.com's 2025 word of the year has no definition</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Dictionary.com has crowned a set of numbers as its 2025 word of the year.</p> <p>It says it reserves that distinction for a word that reflects "social trends and global events that defined that year" and "reveals the stories we tell about ourselves and how we've changed over the year." The word of the year is both viral vernacular and a linguistic time capsule (last year's, for example, was "demure").</p>
<p>This year, that honor goes to "67" — pronounced "six seven" — a slang term that's been delighting kids, exasperating teachers and befuddling adults for months.</p> <p>It has its roots in the song "Doot Doot (6 7)", which Philadelphia-based rapper Skrilla released last December.</p> <p>"The way that switch brrt, I know he dyin' … 6-7, I just bipped right on the highway," Skrilla says, using a verb that in hip-hop can describe anything from a car smash-and-grab to smooth driving to general swag.</p> <p>But it was the phrase "67" that<em> </em>took off. It was popularized online largely through viral TikToks of basketball highlights including of LaMelo Ball, the Charlotte Hornets point guard who happens to stand 6 feet, 7 inches tall.</p>
<p>Then other big-name basketball players, including LeBron James and Paige Bueckers, started using the term in interviews. It spread to other sports and, before long, schools across the country.<strong> </strong>Gen Alpha typically delivers it in a slow drawl with an accompanying hand motion: raising one upturned palm at a time for each number, as if weighing two items.</p>
<p>"Now it is something that you're just trying to use to get somebody to reference the number 67<em> </em>like … 'How tall are you?'… 'what time is it?' … 'what's that?'" middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay, who first posted about the trend back in February, said in an August Instagram video. "There is literally no circumstance where a kid might not say 67."</p> <p>Dictionary.com says searches for 67 surged over the summer, increasing "more than sixfold" since June with no signs of stopping. The term has inspired musical mashups, a recent <em>South Park</em> plotline and plenty of (somewhat cringe) Halloween costumes.</p>
<p>"67 shows the speed at which a new word can rocket around the world as a rising generation enters the global conversation," its announcement reads.</p> <p>Lindsay approves of the choice, telling NPR over email that 67 is "definitely THE word of 2025." He says that while kids tend to lose interest in memes over time, especially as they move across generations, this one has held staying power for nearly the entire year — though its new accolade could potentially change that. </p> <p>"I would imagine after this designation and more people using it, that it is going to start to become cringe to the younger generation," he wrote. "However, I do think that because they are numbers that are seen everywhere, it is going to live on for quite some time in classrooms and in the minds of Gen Alpha." </p>
<p>But what does it actually mean?</p> <h3 class="edTag">Depends on who you ask </h3> <p>Dictionary.com says: "Perhaps the most defining feature of 67 is that it's impossible to define."</p> <p>"It's meaningless, ubiquitous, and nonsensical," it adds. "It's the logical endpoint of being perpetually online, scrolling endlessly, consuming content fed to users by algorithms trained by other algorithms."</p> <p>In other words, the defining world of the year has no real meaning or definition.</p> <p>Even Skrilla, the rapper who coined the term, told <em>XXL </em>magazine this week that he left it intentionally vague, though it initially had a negative connotation.</p>
<p>"67 changed from a negative thing to a positive," he said. "[It's] millions of other things for other people. Everybody got they own meaning to it, 'cause I never put a real meaning on it."</p> <p>Ball, the 6-foot-7 basketball player, similarly struggled to define it when asked in a September TikTok.</p> <p>"It's really nothing though, for real," the 24-year-old said. "Just six seven."</p> <p>Still, as Dictionary.com says, the term's meaning lies in the connection it fosters. It's basically one big inside joke, at least for participants of a certain age.</p> <p>"67 is meaningless in content, but it's not meaningless in feeling," parenting expert Becky Kennedy said in an Instagram video earlier this month. "Think about when you were a kid. What's more powerful than feeling like you belong?"</p>
<p>Evidently, that feeling is powerful enough to propel 67 to the word of the year — beating out a shortlist of contenders including broligarchy, clanker, tradwife and tariff.</p> <p>Lindsay says he's gotten "countless" messages from parents who have connected with their kids "over a 6-7 and have been able to have meaningful conversations as a result." He hopes others will embrace it similarly. </p> <p>"Every trending meme or word is a connection point between adults and the adolescents in their life," he adds. "My advice is always, know what is going on and use it to bridge gaps with the kids in your life."</p>

<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>On Saturday, some 42 million people in the U.S. who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, could lose the ability to afford food because of the ongoing government shutdown.</p> <p>The Trump administration has warned that the debit-like EBT cards that hold an individual's SNAP funds won't be refilled when the money runs out on Nov. 1 — despite millions in emergency contingency money being available.</p> <p>On Friday, two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide SNAP benefits.

<p>This comes as more than 700,000 federal workers are furloughed without pay or continue to work without their regular paychecks <em>also</em> because of the government shutdown.</p> <p>These crises have placed immense pressure on food banks and food pantries across the country to fill in and provide much needed supplies for hungry families.</p>

<p>"Our rent in Texas was like $800," Moreno said. "Here, it's like $1,775."</p> <p>Rent is their biggest cost. They spend $300 a week on groceries and $100 on formula. The couple also have car payments, and they're paying bills for their son's delivery.</p> <p>"I remember sitting there looking at a stack of mail, probably like maybe 3 inches tall … hospital bills, ER bills," Moreno recalled.  "And I looked at my husband. I was like, 'I don't ever want to do this again.'"</p> <h3 class="edTag">Just too expensive to have kids</h3> <p>Months earlier, she thought she'd have multiple kids. But just six weeks after giving birth, Moreno decided to have her tubes tied.</p> <p>"I was kind of like, 'Oh my gosh, my mom was right. This is too expensive.'"</p> <p>Having only one kid means Moreno's family can save a couple of hundred dollars a month for a mortgage, so their son can someday have a backyard.</p> <p>"Not only are homes more expensive, but then add, you know, a 7% [mortgage interest] rate on top of that," said Emily Harris, senior demographer at the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah.</p> <p>She said the rate at which women are having babies in Wyoming is just above the national average but still too low to replace the state's population. The same is true for all other states in the Mountain West, which have seen some of the largest drops in fertility rates nationwide in the past two decades.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the region's population is still growing. A lot of people are moving here to escape bigger cities and for an outdoor lifestyle, which is driving up home costs.</p> <p>Harris said things like child care costs and generational values also play into people's childbearing decisions and that they're definitely changing.</p> <p>"We have this idea of, like, the nuclear family," Harris said. "You need to get married, and then you buy a home and then you have children …  and really over the last decade or two, that kind of timeline has been halted and kind of rearranged."</p> <p>Some states are passing laws aimed at easing housing costs for young families. But not Wyoming.</p> <p>"The biggest barrier to addressing this housing crisis is really convincing my colleagues that the government has a role to play," said state Rep. Trey Sherwood, a member of the Democratic minority.</p> <p>Progressives have pushed for a state fund to help build more affordable housing. But members of the Republican supermajority, like Sen. Bob Ide, say the government should stay out of it.</p> <p>"Fiddling with housing, you know, it gums up the wheels of the free market," Ide said.</p>
<p>He pointed to laws the Wyoming Legislature passed to restrict abortion access, allow nannies to care for more children and ease property taxes as examples of family-friendly policies.</p> <p>But Wyoming couples like Reesie Lane and Sean Thornton say it's still just too expensive to have kids now.</p> <p>"Sean and I started dating and he said, 'I don't know, I think I want to have like six or seven kids,'" Lane said, as Thornton laughed.</p> <p>"[But] as we went through more and more financial struggles I guess, eventually it came to like, 'Yeah, I think we can have like one or two,'" she added.</p> <p>Lane and Thornton both work in the state university system. They spent their 20s struggling to pay rent in tiny apartments, and then around age 30, they finally bought a house.</p>
<p>"I think that's when we started to realize it might be too late," said Lane, who also has an ovarian syndrome that makes it hard to conceive. " I'm not sure that we're going to be able to have children."</p> <p>Lane said it's heartbreaking to not have enough money to give even one kid a full life, but that it's also freeing.</p> <p>For now, they're content with their fur babies, a Pomeranian and a shih tzu mix that were dressed in matching bandanas with fall leaves.</p> <p>"They're a hundred percent little babies," Lane said, holding up the well-dressed pups, Huckleberry and Finn. "They're so spoiled."</p>

<div class="article-title">It's not for Halloween — it's Comic Con, where Black and Caribbean cosplayers find community</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>For 19 years, New York Comic Con (NYCC) has been the East Coast's most celebrated gala of geekdom. In 2024, the convention welcomed more than 200,000 attendees. In 2025, that number swelled by 50,000, making it the, or one of the, most highly attended conventions in the U.S.</p> <p>From novice nerds to masters, every October, the Javits Center teems with enthusiasts attending author, actor and production company panels, autograph signings and fandom meetups. They play console and tabletop games, enter contests and spend their precious gold and silver coins on NYCC exclusives and trinkets. But, arguably, the most exciting thing about the event is seeing the thousands of people who bring their favorite book, comic, movie, television show or video game character to life through cosplay.</p>
<p>Cosplayers are a community unto themselves, and at NYCC, the likelihood of passing by a fully functioning DIY transformer costume is as great as passing someone on the street who had a bodega bacon, egg and cheese sandwich for breakfast. Characters from classic horror movies, the DC Universe and Marvel are always popular choices, as are those from the Star Wars and Game of Thrones franchises. The anime community is well-represented too; fans in <em>Chainsaw Man, Dan Da Dan, Demon Slayer</em> and <em>My Hero Academia</em> costumes can be seen sauntering down the halls, snapping selfies together.</p>
<p>Finding your tribe within the denizens of cosplayers, when that tribe is a minority group often not expected to engage in the activity, is especially heartwarming. While it's true that these types of events are generally considered safe spaces that welcome geeks and nerds of all heritages, many Black and Caribbean cosplayers say the community at NYCC is nothing short of thrilling.</p>
<p>The mutual excitement is contagious, because more often than not, they tell NPR, they grew up isolated from their community at large because of their geeky and nerdy interests — as well as from cosplayers of other backgrounds. The people featured here hail from, or have roots in Barbados, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Haiti, the U.S. Virgin Islands, The Bahamas, Dominica, Saint Lucia and the Dominican Republic. Many speak of cosplay's power to build or strengthen family bonds and friendships or how it provides an outlet for escape. Seeing others, of all ages, who look like them at NYCC, takes an already electrifying experience to new heights. For four days, Black and Caribbean cosplayers can find each other. Their joy is a powerful affirmation of how glorious it feels to be seen by your scene.</p>

<div class="article-title">A judge to weigh in on SNAP benefits. And, Trump wants to resume nuclear testing</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p><em>Good morning. You're reading the Up First newsletter. </em>Subscribe<em> here to get it delivered to your inbox, and </em>listen<em> to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.</em></p> <h3 class="edTag">Today's top stories</h3> <p><strong>Tomorrow, many Americans will feel the impact of the government shutdown as SNAP food benefits will run out for about 42 million people.</strong> Saturday also marks the start of enrollment on federal insurance exchanges, and premiums are expected to more than double on average. Democrats say they'll vote to reopen the government if Congress extends health care subsidies to help manage the rising costs. Yesterday, major airlines asked Congress to pass the Republicans' stopgap funding plan as air traffic controllers continue to work without pay.</p>
<ul class="edTag"><li>🎧 <strong>Democrats have traditionally been hesitant to shut down the government</strong>, but don't appear to be backing down, NPR's Barbara Sprunt tells <em>Up First</em>. Democrats seem to think Republicans will take the blame for the shutdown and not them. They are hoping public pressure will build on the GOP over the expected rise in costs of health insurance premiums. Republicans say they are holding votes to fund the government and if Democrats care about funding nutrition aid and paying air traffic controllers, they would vote with them.</li></ul>
<p><strong>SNAP benefits have never been cut off due to a shutdown, and now a federal judge is stepping in to decide </strong>whether to order the Trump administration to find ways to get people money to buy food. The Agriculture Department posted on its website that "the well has run dry" and stated in a memo that it doesn't have sufficient funds for SNAP benefits for next month and cannot legally use contingency funds. Democratic governors and attorneys general from about two dozen states sued, arguing that SNAP is an entitlement that cannot be simply cut off. <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>🎧 <strong>Even if the ruling comes soon, there will still be a delay in states receiving the funds they need</strong>, according to NPR's Jennifer Ludden. This is because the federal government sends funding to the states before the first of the month, and then it takes days to get it onto the debit-like cards that people use. An added complication is that the full SNAP funding for November is approximately $9 billion, but the administration reports that there is only about $5.5 billion in the contingency fund. Recalculating for partial payments could take weeks, resulting in people not only having to wait but also getting less money.</li></ul>
<p><strong>President Trump announced yesterday that the U.S. would resume testing nuclear weapons for the first time in decades.</strong> Some experts believe that this decision would be a major escalation and could disrupt the nuclear balance of power. <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>🎧<strong> The world's major nuclear powers have observed a testing moratorium since the 1990s as a goodwill gesture for stability after the Cold War</strong>, says NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. The U.S. embarked on a program that utilizes science to ensure weapons function effectively without requiring testing. Much of that science happens in the same tunnels in the desert outside of Las Vegas where the government used to conduct nuclear testing. The U.S. has a significant technological advantage over Russia and China regarding nuclear weapons, but if those countries resume testing, they could narrow that gap, says Jon Wolfsthal at the Federation of American Scientists. There are also environmental concerns that even if radiation is contained underground, the shaking would be enough to damage buildings near the site.</li></ul> <h3 class="edTag">Deep dive</h3>
<p>A closer look at the effects of an experimental Alzheimer's drug called valiltramiprosate, or ALZ-801, is reviving hope that a twice-daily pill might slow down the disease in people who are at high risk of developing it. In April, researchers released results from a study involving over 300 individuals age 50 and older who were genetically predisposed to Alzheimer's disease. The overall findings indicated that those who received the drug did not perform better than those given a placebo. However, in September, a further analysis of a subgroup of 125 participants revealed mild benefits for those who had only mild memory issues at the start of their treatment with the drug. <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>💊 By one measure, the drug slowed cognitive decline by 52% in people with mild cognitive impairment. It is challenging, however, to assess the true impact of ALZ-801 due to the small sample size in the mild cognitive impairment group.</li><li>💊 ALZ-801 could get special consideration from the Food and Drug Administration due to its potential advantages over the two drugs already on the market. The drug can be taken at home and does not cause swelling or bleeding in the brain, which often comes with monoclonal antibody treatment.</li><li>💊 More evidence of the drug's effectiveness is expected to come from people who have continued to take the medicine after the initial 18-month study period ended, says David Watson, a co-author of the new study.</li></ul>

<div class="article-title">The Trump administration move to study aluminum in vaccines worries scientists</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The Trump administration is studying the safety of an ingredient commonly used in vaccines, an additive that contains aluminum.  Coming after other recent changes to vaccine policy,  many public health experts worry that the administration may now try to remove the ingredient. </p> <p>"We want no aluminum in the vaccine," President Trump said recently at a White House briefing. </p> <p>For almost a century, some important vaccines, including shots that protect against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis and the flu, have included aluminum salts, compounds that contain small amounts of aluminum. They are used as adjuvants to give the immune system an extra kick necessary to make the shots protective.</p>
<p>"Aluminum is added to some vaccines because it's a very safe, but also effective, stimulant of the immune system," says Dr. Jesse Goodman, a vaccine expert at Georgetown University who used to regulate vaccines at the Food and Drug Administration. "It basically stimulates your cells to make more antibodies and a stronger immune response overall."</p>
<p>But Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, has questioned the safety of aluminum in vaccines for years. And a special working group is now studying the "safety of ingredients that are present in multiple different vaccines," including aluminum, for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.</p> <p>One question the working group is considering is "do either of the two different aluminum adjuvants increase the risk of asthma?" according to a document outlining the group's mandate.</p> <p>Most public health experts say there's no good evidence that aluminum is unsafe and ample evidence that it poses no real concern. In fact, a large Danish study recently debunked any danger.</p> <p>"We do not see any evidence that aluminum is a cause of serious illness in childhood," says Anders Hviid, a professor of epidemiology at the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark who led the study involving more than 1.2 million Danish children. "There is no scientific reason to take aluminum out of childhood vaccines. There's no science that supports that it's dangerous."</p>
<p>But some researchers welcome the move.</p> <p>"I really believe that aluminum in vaccines is inherently bad. Full stop," says Christopher Exley, a longtime critic of aluminum in vaccines who recently retired from Keele University in the U.K. "And so any suggestion that we're going to remove it, I think, is absolutely marvelous, not only for making America healthy again but for making the world healthy again."</p>
<p>In addition to concerns over asthma, Exley thinks aluminum can also increase the risk for other  health problems, including autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. </p> <p>Hviid and others say trying to remove aluminum would cause significant problems for protecting people against serious diseases. Most importantly, the vaccines that contain aluminum would be rendered ineffective.</p> <p>"To simply remove aluminum — in effect destroying or limiting the effectiveness of vaccines — is incredibly stupid," says Dr. Stanley Plotkin, a leading authority on vaccine science at the University of Pennsylvania.</p> <p>People are exposed to far more aluminum in the environment than from vaccines, Plotkin notes. </p> <p>And if federal regulators deem aluminum unsafe as a vaccine ingredient, vaccine makers would have to develop and test alternatives, a process that could take years. Such a move could undermine public trust in existing vaccines. </p> <p>"And what has happened with measles will happen with other diseases — that is, coming back to this country," Plotkin says. "So, do we want that? Well, apparently some people do." </p> <p>Federal health officials have not stated that they would pull existing vaccines with aluminum salts from the market, or that they want any diseases to return. </p> <p>HHS press secretary Emily G. Hilliard declined to respond to specific questions about the safety of aluminum adjuvants or the practicality of removing them, but said in an emailed statement that "ACIP is reviewing the body of science related to aluminum and other possible contaminants in childhood vaccine."</p>
<p>And some scientists are open to at least studying the question of removing aluminum salts. </p> <p>"It's human nature to try to make things even better, right?" says Dr. Ofer Levy, a pediatrician who runs the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children's Hospital. "So with all of the sophisticated science we have in the year 2025, probably there's room for improvement."</p> <p>But Levy stresses that any changes should only be made if unbiased, well-conducted studies support that. In the meantime, Levy and others say that no one should hesitate about getting a vaccine containing aluminum.</p> <p>"The question becomes: How do we give voice to legitimate concerns about vaccines without throwing the baby out with the bathwater?" Levy says.</p>

<div class="article-title">5 key takeaways from Trump's week in Asia</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>President Trump is back in Washington after spending a week in Asia. He attended the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, addressed U.S. troops in Japan and met with China's President Xi Jinping in South Korea.</p> <p>Here are five takeaways from the president's first visit to the region in his second term.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>1. U.S.-China trade relations have mostly stabilized …</strong></h3> <p>On the flight back to Washington after his meeting with Xi on Thursday, Trump said the tariff rate on Chinese exports would be lowered from 57% to 47%. The 10-point drop comes because Xi committed to trying to decrease the amount of fentanyl coming into the U.S. That issue has been a priority for Trump, who months ago put an extra 20% tariff on China because of fentanyl.</p>
<p>Trump also said that China would resume buying soybeans from the U.S., which has been a major issue for American farmers since China had halted those purchases.</p> <p>China also agreed to back off the extra limits it had put on rare earths exports, in exchange for the U.S. scaling back some of its own export restrictions. That agreement will hold for a year.</p> <p>Those minerals are critical for the U.S. and other countries because they are used in military equipment and other technology.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>2. But a finalized deal isn't done</strong></h3> <p>"It was an outstanding group of decisions I think that was made," Trump told reporters after his meeting with Xi. "There wasn't too much left out there."</p> <p>But he wasn't specific about what exactly is left for China and the U.S. to discuss.</p> <p>Trump said he is scheduled to visit China next April, which will be followed by another meeting with Xi in either Washington or in Florida.</p>
<p>Dennis Wilder, a former national security official and a professor at Georgetown University, said the meeting between Trump and Xi gave "momentum" for trade talks between the two countries to continue.</p> <p>"Both sides have not given up their trade weapons but merely have agreed to stop firing as long as both sides hold to the agreements," Wilder said.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>3. Diplomacy = flattery</strong></h3> <p>A charm offensive was on full display in Malaysia, Japan and Korea as leaders tried to cater to Trump ahead of trade talks and other negotiations. Trump's style of foreign relations is often rooted in personal relationships; heads of state, when visiting Washington, have tried to appease Trump to have a smoother relationship with the president.</p>
<p>That strategy came forward in Asia, too. Nearly 100 dancers in Malaysia greeted Trump on the red carpet at his first stop. In Japan, Trump was gifted late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's golf clubs and the newly elected prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, announced that she was going to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p>Trump's arrival in South Korea was also full of fanfare — "YMCA," a song that's played at Trump's rallies for nearly a decade, was performed on the tarmac in Busan when Air Force One landed. President Lee Jae Myung gave Trump a replica of a golden crown significant to Korea's history. Trump also got a gold medal and was awarded Korea's highest civilian honor.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>4. Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker</strong></h3> <p>Trump has renamed the Department of Defense as the Department of War, he's deployed National Guard troops around different U.S. cities and in recent weeks, he has ordered strikes on a number of boats in the eastern Pacific allegedly carrying drugs.</p> <p>But on this trip in Asia, Trump wanted to emphasize his role as a peacemaker.</p> <p>His first stop in Malaysia at the ASEAN summit included presiding over the signing of a peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand. A border dispute reignited between the two countries earlier this year, and Trump helped broker a ceasefire by threatening to increase tariffs.</p> <p>In his remarks in Kuala Lumpur, Trump said he was in Scotland playing golf when he got on the phone with the leaders from Cambodia and Thailand, and Malaysia, who also helped broker peace.</p> <p>"You caused me very good entertainment. I could've had a lot of fun, but this is much more fun for me than anything," Trump said.</p> <p>Even before the trip, Trump had been claiming his administration has ended eight global conflicts. Russia's war in Ukraine hasn't been one of them, which has frustrated Trump.</p>
<p>But it's possible he adds another conflict to solve to his peacemaking list. Though he didn't meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while in Asia, Trump left the door open for a future meeting and said his administration would work on tensions between North and South Korea, which never formally ended their war.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>5. Trump's making deals abroad, but Congress is still at a standstill</strong></h3> <p>Despite the dealmaking and peacemaking on the world's stage, Trump came home to a federal government that's still shut down, federal workers who aren't getting paid and critical programs like SNAP running out of funding. The president hasn't shown the same interest in making deals across the aisle with Democrats to reopen the government.</p> <p>Instead, he returned to Washington on Thursday night and mused on Truth Social about using the "nuclear option," which he said would be to get rid of the filibuster. That would allow Senate Republicans to pass a funding agreement with a simple majority, not a 60-vote majority that would require support from Democrats.</p> <p>"We are in power and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying 'SHUT DOWN'," Trump said, adding that ending the filibuster<strong> </strong>would "take advantage" of Democrats. Democrats have refused to vote in favor of the agreement to temporarily fund the government unless it includes a measure that would extend the tax credit that lowers the cost of health insurance premiums, which is set to expire at the end of the year.</p>
