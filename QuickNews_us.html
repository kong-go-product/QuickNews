<div class="article-title">Emergency flights diverted from Portland hospital amid 'laser party' threats at ICE facility: report</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A call to shine laser lights into the sky in an effort to disrupt federal helicopters flying over South Portland has prompted serious safety concerns and forced a key trauma hospital to reroute air ambulances.</p><p>The online flyer, posted on the homepage of Rose City Counter-Info, a self-described "anarchist counter-info platform in so-called Portland, Oregon," encourages participants to take part in a "laser tag" event aimed at federal aircraft. </p><p>The post urges individuals to mask up, coordinate with others, and take steps to avoid identification – including cleaning laser pointers with alcohol, wearing gloves, and removing potential DNA traces before disposal.</p><p>As a result of the planned activity, Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) reported that multiple air ambulance providers declined to land at the hospital’s rooftop helipad on Saturday night, according to KGW.</p><p>Instead, they redirected their helicopters to nearby airports, requiring patients to be transferred to OHSU by ground ambulance — a process estimated to add 45 to 60 minutes to travel time.</p><p>"For most patients, that will be an acceptable delay. However, for some sensitive situations, such as unstable trauma patients, STEMIs and strokes, the delay could have real impacts," OHSU said in an email to KGW. </p><p>The hospital also advised staff to "incorporate additional transit time into their decision-making," and strongly urged the public not to participate in the laser event, calling it "extremely dangerous."</p><p>OHSU later clarified that the decision to divert flights was made by the air ambulance vendors themselves, not the hospital.</p><p>In a statement to Fox News Digital, the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) emphasized that pointing lasers at aircraft endangers both pilots and people on the ground and is prohibited under state and federal law. </p><p>The bureau added it "regularly" arrests individuals for targeting police aircraft with lasers, including one arrest earlier this week. While police confirmed they were monitoring the ICE building on Saturday, they said the presence was not greater than usual. Police also reported no laser strikes that night.</p><p>The Port of Portland, which oversees general aviation in the region, acknowledged the uptick in helicopter and propeller aircraft activity.</p><p>"We are aware of the higher volume of helicopter and propeller airplane activity over South and Southwest Portland," the Port said. "This appears to be related to federal law enforcement and/or military activity and is not a development the Port of Portland can control."</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has also condemned the call to target aircraft with lasers, warning that the act is a federal crime.</p><p>"Aiming a laser pointer at an aircraft is a federal crime. This is incredibly dangerous for the aircraft personnel and for the public’s safety," DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a previous statement to Fox News Digital. "Antifa domestic terrorists WILL NOT overrun our cities. We will bust their networks and bring every one of them to justice."</p><p>Federal officials cited a recent incident as evidence of the risks such actions pose. On September 30, DHS reported that four Mexican nationals living in the U.S. illegally were arrested in Portland after allegedly shining a laser at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) helicopter, endangering both the crew and people below.</p><p>Portland has remained a focal point for demonstrations against federal immigration enforcement, with protests near the ICE facility continuing for several weeks. In some instances, demonstrators have displayed provocative props such as a guillotine to symbolize opposition to federal actions.</p><p>Earlier this week, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem visited the ICE facility in Portland, where she prayed with officers dealing with the ongoing unrest.</p><p>Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, however, disputed characterizations of widespread disorder. "There is no insurrection," Kotek said, expressing confidence that "local law enforcement will meet the moment." She added that during her meeting with Noem, she reiterated Oregon’s expectation that DHS and ICE operations comply with state law.</p><p>Kotek joins several other Democratic governors who have pushed back against the Trump administration’s expanded federal enforcement efforts.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to OHSU for comment. </p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Rachel Wolf contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Hollywood stars pay tribute to Diane Keaton after legendary actress and comedian dies at 79</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Goldie Hawn, Steve Martin and Jane Fonda were among the many stars who honored Diane Keaton after the legendary actress died at the age of 79. </p><p>On Saturday, Keaton's death was reported by People magazine, with the outlet noting that her family had requested privacy. </p><p>After news broke of Keaton's passing, there was an outpouring of tributes to the Hollywood legend from her former co-stars and other celebrities.</p><p>Hawn, who co-starred with Keaton and Bette Midler in the 1996 hit ensemble comedy "The First Wives Club," shared an emotional post on Instagram. </p><p>"Diane, we aren’t ready to lose you. You’ve left us with a trail of fairy dust, filled with particles of light and memories beyond imagination," Hawn wrote alongside a photo of Keaton. </p><p>She continued: "How do we say goodbye? What words can come to mind when your heart is broken? You never liked praise, so humble, but now you can’t tell me to ‘shut up’ honey. There was, and will be, no one like you. You stole the hearts of the world and shared your genius with millions, making films that made us laugh and cry in ways only you could."</p><p>"I was blessed to make ‘First Wives Club’ with you, our days starting with coffee in the makeup trailer, laughing and joking, right through to the very last day of filming," Hawn added. "It was a roller coaster of love.</p><p>"We agreed to grow old together, and one day, maybe live together with all our girlfriends," Hawn wrote. "Well, we never got to live together, but we did grow older together. Who knows… maybe in the next life.</p><p>"Shine your fairy dust up there, girlfriend. I’m going to miss the hell out of you. My heart goes out to your beautiful children, Dex and Duke," the Academy Award winner concluded. </p><p>Midler also paid tribute to Keaton, posting a black-and-white image of the actress on her Instagram page along with a heartfelt caption. </p><p>"The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died," she wrote. "I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me.</p><p>"She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star," Midler added. "What you saw was who she was…oh, la, lala!"</p><p>Fonda, Candice Bergen, Mary Steenburgen and Don Johnson, who co-starred with Keaton in 2018's "Book Club" and its 2023 sequel "Book Club: The Next Chapter," also shared tributes.</p><p>"It’s hard to believe...or accept…that Diane has passed," she wrote in the caption of a photo featuring Keaton.</p><p>"She was always a spark of life and light, constantly giggling at her own foibles, being limitlessly creative…in her acting, her wardrobe, her books, her friends, her homes, her library, her world view," Fonda continued. "Unique is what she was. And, though she didn’t know it or wouldn’t admit it, man she was a fine actress!"</p><p>"Diane was magic," Steenburgen wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital. "There was no one, nor will there ever be, anyone like her. I loved her and felt blessed to be her friend. My love to her family. What a wonder she was!!!"</p><p>Bergen also shared a statement with Fox News Digital, writing, "This is a huge loss both personally and for all of us. Diane was a true artist – tremendously gifted and uniquely talented in so many disciplines yet also modest and wonderfully eccentric. I will miss her terribly."</p><p>"Diane Keaton … what a trip!" Johnson told Fox News Digital in a statement. "She was one of those unique actresses that once she’d realized a character you just couldn’t  imagine anyone else’s interpretation.  I loved her ... I’ll miss her."</p><p>Martin, who played Keaton's on-screen husband in the hit 1991 comedy "Father of the Bride" and its 1995 sequel "Father of the Bride II," which also starred Martin Short, shared a humorous remembrance of the actress as he posted a screenshot of quotes from a joint interview with his co-stars.</p><p>"Who's sexier? Me or Steve Martin?" Short asked in the article, published by Interview magazine in 2021. </p><p>"I mean, you're both idiots," Keaton replied.</p><p>"Don’t know who first posted this, but it sums up our delightful relationship with Diane," Martin wrote in the caption.</p><p>Kimberly Williams-Paisley, who portrayed Annie Banks, the daughter of Martin's George Banks and Keaton's Nina Banks in the "Father of the Bride" movies, commented on the "Only Murders in the Building" star's post, writing, "I can absolutely hear her saying that," adding a crying laughing smiley face emoji. </p><p>Williams-Paisley also shared her own Instagram tribute to Keaton, posting photos of herself with her on-screen mother. </p><p>"Diane, working with you will always be one of the highlights of my life," Williams-Paisley wrote in the caption. "You are one of a kind, and it was thrilling to be in your orbit for a time. Thank you for your kindness, your generosity, your talent, and above all, your laughter." </p><p>Mandy Moore, who played the daughter of Keaton's character in the hit 2007 romantic comedy "Because I Said So," honored the actress as she remembered their time working together on the film.</p><p>"They say don’t meet your heroes, but I got to work with one of mine and even call her ‘mom’ for a few months," Moore recalled in the caption of an Instagram post featuring photos of the two in the movie.</p><p>"An honor of a lifetime," she continued. "What an incandescent human Di is and was. I am so sad she’s gone for all the reasons but also because it felt like she’d be here forever, dazzling us with her talent and charm (and her style, c’mon)!!! One of the very best to ever do it. All my love to her children and loved ones."</p><p>Hawn's daughter, Kate Hudson, uploaded a clip from "The First Wives Club," writing, "We love you so much Diane."</p><p>Lily Tomlin posted a photo of Keaton along with the caption: "Rest peacefully, the magnificent Diane Keaton."</p><p>In an Instagram post, Melissa Joan Hart shared her shock at Keaton's passing and heaped praise on the late actress. </p><p>"There are some people you think will live forever and it took my breath away to hear about Diane Keaton passing away today!" she wrote. "Her body of work, her class, her style, her ability to be wildly talented and keep her private life out of tabloids is to be respected and studied for generations." </p><p>"Thanks for the laughs and tears!" she continued. "From #BabyBoom to #SomethingsGottaGive, I've enjoyed every movie I've seen with her but I have to admit I've never seen #AnnieHall. I know what I'm doing this weekend now! #GodBlesstheFunnyPeople."</p><p>In 1977, Keaton won an Academy Award for her performance as the titular character in "Annie Hall" and she was nominated for the award three additional times. </p><p>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences paid tribute to Keaton in an Instagram post, sharing a clip featuring an emotional scene between the late actress and her on-screen son Dermott Mulroney in their 2005 movie "The Family Stone."</p><p>"Some actors play emotions. Diane Keaton lived inside them," the organization wrote. "Diane Keaton embodied the contradictions of being human: funny and fragile, bright and bruised, always achingly honest. For decades, she filled every frame with warmth, wit, and wonder. A Best Actress Oscar winner and four-time nominee, her presence shaped generations of storytelling. Her spirit will live forever on screen, and in the hearts of all who saw themselves in her."</p><p>Lisa Lange, the senior vice president of PETA, honored Keaton for her advocacy on behalf of animals. </p><p>"Diane Keaton’s impact as a brilliant and talented actor is undeniable, but PETA will always remember her as a true friend to animals," Lange said in a statement to Fox News Digital. </p><p>She continued, "At every turn, she used her platform to champion animals, from advocating kindness toward animals often overlooked, such as pigeons, to taking on abusive cub-petting operations by endorsing the Big Cat Public Safety Act, to ditching meat and reminding everyone that 'it’s nuts' to eat animals. Diane’s heart was evident in everything she did, and she will be greatly missed by all of us at PETA."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Protesters interrupt Kamala Harris’ Chicago book tour event, forcing multiple removals</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris’ book tour stop in Chicago was disrupted multiple times Saturday afternoon, as security removed several protesters during a tense event promoting her new memoir, "107 Days."</p><p>As Harris discussed her book with journalist Michele Norris, who was moderating the event, at least one protester began shouting from the audience, prompting a chorus of "get her out" from attendees. Security quickly escorted the woman from the venue.</p><p>Footage from the event showed at least two additional disruptions, including a man who appeared to shout about genocide before being removed. The motivations behind the protests were not immediately clear.</p><p>The audience responded with applause when Norris addressed the disruptions by saying, "We encourage people to use their voices, but we want them to show respect for this woman." </p><p>Harris responded with a bit of humor, adding, "And please pronounce my name correctly…"</p><p>It's not the first time Harris’ book tour has drawn protests. Since launching her national book tour late last month, Harris has faced similar interruptions at several stops promoting "107 Days," which recounts her 2024 presidential campaign following President Biden’s withdrawal from the race. </p><p>The book chronicles her 107-day sprint to Election Day and offers a behind-the-scenes look at campaign decisions, staff tensions, and political challenges she faced during that period.</p><p>Beyond the live events, Harris' memoir and the publicity surrounding it have sparked criticism — even from within her own party. </p><p>An advisor to a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender told Politico, "At a time when people are looking for a vision and leadership... and want to see leaders rise to the level of threat facing the country, it’s pretty crazy she chose to write a gossip book that prioritizes the pettiness of her politics." </p><p>The advisor added, "It’s embarrassing for her, and for all Democrats, considering she was the leader of the party less than a year ago."</p><p>Former CNN journalist Chris Cillizza also weighed in critically, writing on his Substack, "Harris’ recent media tour to tout her memoir — ‘107 Days’ — has reminded me of something I think I have long known: She is simply not a very good politician. And she hasn’t gotten much better over her decades in the business." </p><p>In a post on X, Cillizza noted that Harris' return to the public stage reminded him "she’s not good on her feet," and added, "she speaks in word salads."</p><p>Criticism has also come from Democratic strategist Gary South, who told The Hill that the timing of Harris’ memoir was less than ideal. </p><p>Referencing the book’s tone, South said excerpts suggest "she came out with arms flailing and guns blazing, blaming everyone but herself for her loss." </p><p>He continued, "it is a curiously negative and ungracious tome for someone who reportedly thinks she can run again in 2028."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Harris's office for comment. </p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Hanna Panreck contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A judge ruled on Saturday that National Guard troops sent to Illinois by President Donald Trump to combat crime can remain in the state but can’t patrol or deploy to protect federal property. </p><p>The Trump administration had requested an emergency stay after U.S. District Judge April Perry on Thursday blocked the deployment of National Guard troops in Chicago and across Illinois for at least two weeks. </p><p>Perry said there was no evidence of a "danger of rebellion" in the state as Trump has suggested he may invoke the Insurrection Act, which would mean the federal government could send troops to states that defy federal laws or don’t put down an insurrection. </p><p>"I’d do it if it was necessary. So far it hasn’t been necessary. But we have an Insurrection Act for a reason," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. </p><p>The Insurrection Act was last invoked in 1992 during the LA riots. </p><p>"There has been no showing that the civil power has failed," Perry said.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump said Friday he plans to travel to Israel and Egypt before quickly returning to Washington, D.C., to honor the late Charlie Kirk with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian award.</p><p>Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said he will address Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, and then visit Cairo as part of a trip marking the historic peace deal he secured between Israel and Hamas. He is expected to return to the White House to honor Kirk on Tuesday, Oct. 14 — which would have been the conservative activist’s 32nd birthday.</p><p>"It's not easy for me to get back. It's a very quick trip, but I'll be making two major stops, and then I'll be on the plane trying to get back in time for Charlie," Trump said Friday. "They're going to have a great celebration at the White House — in the East Room of the White House."</p><p>The President will arrive in Israel early Monday, where he is expected to deliver an address at the Knesset and meet with recently freed hostages, an Israeli official told The Times of Israel. Under the peace deal, Hamas must hand over all 48 living and deceased hostages within a 72-hour window that began Friday night local time.</p><p>"They're getting them, and they're also getting the bodies, approximately 28 bodies. … It's a tragedy," Trump said. "… I'll be going to Israel. I'll be speaking at the Knesset, I think early on, and then I'm also going to Egypt."</p><p>Egypt will host an international summit in the Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday to finalize the peace agreement. More than 20 world leaders, including Trump, are expected to attend, an Egyptian presidential spokesperson said Saturday, according to Reuters.</p><p>"I'll go to Cairo, I think that's where we're going, as opposed to the place of the signing," Trump told reporters. "We have a lot of leaders from all over the world coming too. I know they've been invited." </p><p>Trump is scheduled to return to Washington by Tuesday for the White House ceremony honoring Kirk, who was assassinated Sept. 10 during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University.</p><p>"And then I'm coming back, I believe it's Tuesday night for Charlie Kirk, a friend of mine, a friend of all of us, a friend of a lot of the people right here," Trump said.</p><p>The president called the event a "great celebration," noting that Erika Kirk, the activist’s widow, and many others will be in attendance.</p><p>"We're giving him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is the highest honor you get outside the Congressional Medal of Honor — one's military, one's civilian," he said. "But it's the greatest honor, and Erika, his beautiful wife, is going to be here and a lot of people are going to be here."</p><p>Trump first announced last month that he would award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously.</p><p>"I will soon be awarding Charlie Kirk posthumously, the Presidential Medal of Freedom," Trump said at the time. "The day of the ceremony will be announced, and I can only guarantee you one thing. That we will have a very big crowd. Very, very big."</p><p>On Thursday, Hamas agreed to a peace deal pushed by Trump to end the war in Gaza and return the hostages, two years after the terrorist network attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump railed against Democrats over the ongoing government shutdown Saturday, saying he is directing Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to make sure military service members get paid next week. </p><p>"Chuck Schumer recently said, ‘Every day gets better’ during their Radical Left Shutdown," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "I DISAGREE! If nothing is done, because of ‘Leader’ Chuck Schumer and the Democrats, our Brave Troops will miss the paychecks they are rightfully due on October 15th."</p><p>He said he directed Hegseth "to use all available funds to get our Troops PAID on October 15th. We have identified funds to do this, and Secretary Hegseth will use them to PAY OUR TROOPS."</p><p>"I will not allow the Democrats to hold our Military, and the entire Security of our Nation, HOSTAGE, with their dangerous Government Shutdown," he added. "The Radical Left Democrats should OPEN THE GOVERNMENT, and then we can work together to address Healthcare, and many other things that they want to destroy. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"</p><p>The government shut down on Oct. 1, after Democrats and Republicans failed to pass a spending bill to fund the government, with Democrats concerned expiring Affordable Care Act tax cuts could raise premiums and that Medicaid cuts could leave people without coverage.  </p><p>Trump on Monday blamed Democratic lawmakers for the shutdown, saying he’d be "happy to work with the Democrats on their failed healthcare policies" once the government reopens.</p><p>"Democrats have SHUT DOWN the United States government right in the midst of one of the most successful economies, including a record stock market, that our country has ever had," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "This has sadly affected so many programs, services, and other elements of society that Americans rely on — and it should not have happened.</p><p>"I am happy to work with the Democrats on their failed healthcare policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our government to re-open."</p><p>Schumer recently told Punchbowl News, "Every day gets better for us," regarding the Democrats’ shutdown strategy.</p><p>He added, "It’s because we’ve thought about this long in advance, and we knew that healthcare would be the focal point on Sept. 30, and we prepared for it. … Their whole theory was — threaten us, bamboozle us and we would submit in a day or two."</p><p>Republicans have blamed Schumer for the shutdown, saying it was meant to appease the Democratic Party’s progressive wing, particularly in his home state as Zohran Mamdani maintains the lead in New York City's mayoral race and buzz swirls regarding Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., potentially challenging Schumer in the next primary. She has not formally declared a Senate bid.</p><p>"Chuck Schumer just said the quiet part out loud: Democrats are gleefully inflicting pain on the American people over their push to give illegal aliens free healthcare," White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson said in a statement provided exclusively to Fox News Digital. </p><p>Schumer recently shared with Fox News Digital remarks he made on the Senate floor. </p><p>"Every day that Republicans refuse to negotiate to end this shutdown, the worse it gets for Americans — and the clearer it becomes who’s fighting for them. Each day our case to fix healthcare and end this shutdown gets better and better, stronger and stronger because families are opening their letters showing how high their premiums will climb if Republicans get their way. They’re seeing why this fight matters — it’s about protecting their healthcare, their bank accounts and their futures."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Tiger Woods has undergone surgery after suffering another major injury. </p><p>Woods, 49, announced Saturday that he recently underwent lumbar disk replacement surgery for a collapsed disc and a compromised spinal canal. </p><p>"After experiencing pain and lack of mobility in my back, I consulted with doctors and surgeons to have tests taken. The scans determined that I had a collapsed disc in L4/5, disc fragments and a compromised spinal canal," Woods said in a statement. </p><p>"I opted to have my disc replaced yesterday, and I already know I made a good decision for my health and my back."</p><p>For Woods, it is the latest health setback in what has been a series of devastating injuries and subsequent procedures in recent years. </p><p>Woods underwent an operation to fix a nerve impingement in his lower back in September, and he's already been sidelined from the PGA Tour this year while recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon he suffered in March.</p><p>Woods infamously suffered multiple leg injuries when he was involved in a single-vehicle rollover crash in the Los Angeles area Feb. 23, 2021. </p><p>Since finishing tied for ninth at the 2020 Farmers Insurance Open, his best finish in his subsequent 18 official events has been tying for 37th at the 2020 PGA Championship.</p><p>Last year, he competed in just five events, one of them the Genesis Invitational, the other four majors. He withdrew from the Genesis, finished dead last in the Masters and missed the cut in the final three majors.</p><p>That came after he competed in only the Genesis and Masters in 2023, where he finished tied in 45th and withdrew, respectively. In 2022, he played in the Masters (47th), the PGA Championship (withdrew) and The Open Championship (missed cut).</p><p>Just when it appeared Woods was turning the clock back, it seemed like all false hope. In 2018, he finished second in the FedEx Cup standings. In 2019, he won the Masters.</p><p>Since then, it's been a tough stretch for Woods, who, in 14 majors since winning the green jacket in 2019, has failed to muster a top 20 finish. It’s his longest such streak since failing to finish in the top 20 in the first six majors of his career in 1995 and 1996. In his last 26 majors, he has only four top 20 finishes.</p><p>After the U.S. Open, Woods, who turns 50 in December, admitted it "may or may not" have been his last one. His latest injury raises more questions about his future.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Fast-food drive-thrus may not be getting much faster, but they’re getting smarter, and friendlier staff might still matter more than artificial intelligence, a new report found.</p><p>The 25th Annual Drive-Thru Study, conducted by Intouch Insight and QSR magazine, examined 13 fast-food brands across three categories: classic, chicken and beverage. The research was based on 165 undercover visits per brand, conducted by trained evaluators posing as regular customers between June and July of this year for a total of more than 2,000 visits across the U.S.</p><p>Overall, the average total drive-thru time was five minutes and 35 seconds, slightly slower than 2024 but three seconds faster when excluding brands that were just added to the study this year: Popeyes, Dutch Bros, Starbucks and Tim Hortons.</p><p>The fastest overall was Taco Bell, with customers spending about four minutes in line. While Chick-Fil-A was the slowest, it ranked highest in satisfaction, tying with Dutch Bros, a drive-thru coffee company with more than 1,000 locations across 19 states.</p><p>The study noted that drive-thrus have morphed from a place for quick, simple orders into "digital fulfillment hubs." </p><p>"The challenge is no longer just speed, but balancing efficiency with the growing complexity of the modern drive-thru," it said, adding that efficiency, personalization and guest connection all matter.</p><p>Dutch Bros also ranked as the most accurate, followed by Chick-fil-A and Louisiana-based chicken finger chain Raising Cane’s, which tied for second.</p><p>Among the three categories of fast-food, the classic segment, which includes Burger King, McDonald's, Wendy's, Taco Bell and Arby's, ranked fastest and recorded high accuracy at 87%. Taco Bell and Arby's led the pack, according to the report. The group, however, ranked lowest in friendliness.</p><p>The chicken category, which includes Chick-fil-A, KFC, Popeyes and Raising Cane's, had the highest customer satisfaction and friendliness and best food quality. It had the longest waits, however, and lowest accuracy. </p><p>"Accuracy and friendliness are the strongest drivers," the survey noted. "Getting the order right and interacting politely yield high satisfaction." When service was friendly, customers were far more satisfied and their orders were more accurate and faster, the study found.</p><p>The beverage segment, which includes Starbucks, Dunkin', Tim Hortons and Dutch Bros, saw high accuracy and balanced speed with accuracy and had the least amount of upselling. Dutch Bros and Tim Horton's came out on top.</p><p>Across all 13 brands, the study found an average order accuracy of 87%, food quality of 97% and overall satisfaction of 91%.</p><p>For the first time, the study evaluated AI-powered drive-thrus, analyzing 120 AI orders across three restaurants and finding that they were faster but less friendly. Service times averaged three minutes and 53 seconds, compared to four minutes and 15 seconds for human-staffed locations. Order accuracy was slightly lower at 83% versus 87%, yet overall satisfaction was higher — 97% compared to 91%.</p><p>The scores suggest that customers are willing to overlook minor service flaws if it means getting their food faster and more efficiently, the report noted. </p><p>"And let's be honest — there's also an element of novelty at play," it continued. "For many guests, interacting with AI feels new and exciting, which can positively influence how they perceive the overall experience, even when the service isn't perfect."</p><p>Sixty-two percent of AI mistakes were caused by customization issues, such as special requests or unavailable items, but when staff members helped with AI-ordering, accuracy was boosted.</p><p>The report concluded that brands that can combine speed, friendliness and technology will be best positioned to succeed in the modern drive-thru landscape.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Albanian judge killed in courtroom shooting amid growing anger over justice system reforms</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>On Oct. 6, Albanian Appeals Court Judge Astrit Kalaja was shot inside the Tirana courtroom where he oversaw a property dispute case, according to the International Commission of Jurists. Kalaja died of his wounds, and two others were injured in the shooting. The 30-year-old suspect has been arrested.</p><p>Kalaja’s killing quickly became a lightning rod for nationwide dissatisfaction with the Albanian judiciary. </p><p>Former Albanian Ambassador to the United States and the United Nations Agim Nesho told Fox News Digital that reforms implemented almost a decade ago by the European Union and the U.S. were "intended to strengthen the rule of law" but have been "transformed into a political instrument, undermining democratic institutions and concentrating power in the hands of the executive."</p><p>"As a result," Nesho said, "the public's confidence in the justice system has severely eroded, with institutional dysfunction reaching a level where some segments of society feel driven to take justice into their own hands — a dangerous sign of democratic backsliding."</p><p>Opposition Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha told Fox News Digital Kalaja’s killing was "an abominable act and an alarm bell that should not be ignored."</p><p>Berisha said the "evident support that the act has garnered," including the creation of a now inactive GoFundMe to support the killer’s legal rights, demonstrates a "protest against a dysfunctional judiciary, against a corrupt and politicized judicial system."</p><p>Berisha said judicial reforms "left the country without a Constitutional Court and without a High Court for more than five years," creating a "staggering backlog" of around 200,000 cases. He said that the process of vetting judicial personnel turned into "a witch hunt against magistrates that were perceived [to be] independent or potentially right-leaning." </p><p>According to Berisha, this led to the "weaponization of the judiciary against the opposition." </p><p>A 2020 report on U.S. assistance to Albania describes American and EU efforts to "restore the integrity of the Albanian justice system." The report states that USAID assisted the High Court with creating a procedure to manage 72% of its 35,000 backlogged cases. </p><p>It also stated that 125 of 286 judges and prosecutors put through vetting procedures had "been dismissed for unexplained wealth, ties to organized crime, or incompetence," while 50 judges chose to resign rather than go through vetting.</p><p>Berisha claimed that, in the aftermath of reforms, it now takes about 15–20 years for the resolution of legal disputes. "Justice delayed is justice denied," Berisha said.</p><p>Lawyer Besnik Muçi, formerly a prosecutor and a judge in the Constitutional Court of Albania, told Fox News Digital that judicial reforms aimed "to establish a credible, fair, independent, professional, service-oriented justice system that is open, accountable and efficient." He said that the Albanian justice system "has failed in almost all" parameters. </p><p>Muçi said the courts’ backlog consists of about 150,000 cases. He also noted that the closure of five appeal courts and some district courts has "almost blocked the citizens’ access to justice." He also explained that most court buildings do not "meet …the security conditions and standards necessary." </p><p>"Citizens do not believe in the justice system," Muçi said. </p><p>After Kalaja’s murder, the Korça Bar Association and National Bar Association of Albania boycotted court proceedings on Oct. 9-10. Korça Bar Association Director Nevzat Tarelli told Albanian news station CNA that Kalaja’s killing highlighted the need for increased security for and trust in judicial personnel. He also said that "people who expect justice in a timely manner, if they do not receive it, no longer have faith in justice."</p><p>Engjëll Agaçi, general secretary of Albania’s Council of Ministers, did not respond to Fox News Digital’s questions about nationwide discontent with the judiciary or the size of Albania’s court case backlog. </p><p>A State Department spokesperson declined to respond to questions about the success of U.S.-backed judicial reform efforts in Albania or address the issues that Kalaja’s killing has highlighted.</p><p>"We offer our deepest sympathies to the victims of this attack and their families and strongly condemn the use of violence against judges and prosecutors," the spokesperson said.</p></body></div></body></html>

Your courage has moved the world and has touched me in ways that I have never been touched before in my entire life." </p><p>Witkoff also praised Trump as a "humanitarian who once again proved that bold leadership and moral clarity can reshape history and change the world.

I mourn these lives and pray for the families that have been shattered."</p><p>Mamdani’s statement was reposted by the Israeli Foreign Ministry (IFM) on X, where it accused him of "acting as a mouthpiece for Hamas propaganda."</p><p>"By repeating Hamas’s lies, he excuses terror and normalizes antisemitism.

<div class="article-title">Chinese underground church pastor, father of US citizens, detained by authorities, family says</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The pastor of one of China's biggest underground evangelical churches was arrested Friday in what appears to be a roundup of Christian leaders, and his family and followers fear for his safety.</p><p>Pastor Ezra Jin of Zion Church was detained by Chinese authorities, his daughter, Grace Jin, told Fox News Digital. Zion Church was at one point Beijing's largest church. In a document provided to Fox News Digital by Grace, it states that Jin's arrest came as nearly 30 Zion Church pastors and workers were detained or went missing across Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Chengdu, Beihai, Jiaxing and Huangdao. </p><p>The Associated Press reported that dozens of other church leaders in Bejing and at least five other provinces across China were arrested Friday as well.</p><p>"One after another, they were also taken, detained. Like, they were saying that there were people outside their doors, and then one at a time they were taken into custody," Grace told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Zion Church is one of several underground churches operating in China, meaning it is not registered with authorities, making it unlawful, according to the AP.</p><p>"The charges have been something like online dissemination of religious materials, but they have not given any paperwork out to anyone physically. But they've shown the detention slip, and that's what it says on most people's detention [slips]," she said.</p><p>Grace told Fox News Digital that China has implemented a sweeping crackdown on religious leaders in recent months. In May, Light of Zion Church Pastor Gao Quanfu of Xi'an was detained by authorities on charges of "using superstitious activities to undermine the implementation of justice." </p><p>Additionally, in June, multiple church workers from the Golden Lampstand Church in Linfen were sentenced to prison time for "fraud" charges. Grace is concerned authorities could also file a fraud charge against her father because financial documents were taken from Zion Church.</p><p>Since 2018, Jin has been under surveillance and faced an exit ban, meaning he has been unable to reunite with his children, who are U.S. citizens. He has not seen them in more than six years.</p><p>Grace told Fox News Digital the Chinese government shut down Zion Church in 2018 because of its influence because it would host up to 1,500 people each week.</p><p>"When it shut down in 2018, there was no longer anywhere like physical locations that would ever rent out such a big space for Zion," Grace said. "In fact, if you were to rent out even a small space, they would immediately find out, and they would come and take down Zion."</p><p>This put Zion Church in a difficult position, but it instead turned to the now-familiar hybrid model, holding live praise and worship sessions online while also distributing information so people could pray together in smaller groups.</p><p>"When COVID hit in 2020, Zion Church was one of the only churches with this online model," Grace said. "Zion kind of blew up at this point. ... Christians all across China were attending Zion's services because it was the only church service for a while that was hosting things every Sunday online with music and sermons."</p><p>She recalled that as other churches tried to adjust to the virtual world, her father offered his resources and methods to others. She said this helped her father connect not only with the other churches, but with congregants as well.</p><p>Jin's family is calling on the U.S. State Department to demand the Chinese Communist Party release him "immediately and unconditionally, allowing him to return to his family in the United States prior to further persecution at the hands of the Chinese government."</p><p>Jin's fate and the fates of the other church leaders arrested with him remain uncertain, but China Aid, a U.S.-based religious group, said that so-called "house churches," such as Zion, are "facing unprecedented pressure."</p><p>"Xi Jinping has waged a war against God’s Church, such as the Zion Church, that he will never win. The level of persecution against religious freedom has reached the worst [level] in 40 years," China Aid founder and President Bob Fu told Fox News Digital. "Faith is not a crime. Worship is not a crime. Prayer is not a crime.</p><p>"The courage of China’s urban pastors and believers will be remembered in history as a living testimony that the light of Christ cannot be extinguished by tyranny," Fu added. He also called on President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to speak out and condemn the CCP's crackdown.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Test yourself on the Gen Z slang of 2025: Can you decode ‘huzz’ and ‘glazing’?</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>If you’ve recently overheard someone say "6-7" or "mogging" and had no idea what it meant, you're not alone.</p><p>A new analysis of the most-searched slang terms of 2025 shows just how quickly Generation Z and Gen Alpha's social media-fueled language is evolving, leaving even millennials stumped.</p><p>Unscramblerer.com, a website that helps solve word puzzles in games such as Scrabble and Words with Friends, analyzed Google Trends data from January through September to identify which slang terms Americans are most confused by, according to reports.</p><p>"Gen Z’s slang evolves from the bottom up and is heavily shaped by social media algorithms," said Yaron Litwin, an expert in kids’ online culture and chief marketing officer for Canopy Parental Control App, which is based in the U.S. and Israel. </p><p>"It’s heavy in code-switching, emojis and irony, and spreads through micro-communities online rather than big TV or radio moments like in past generations," Litwin told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Even if older generations are on the same platforms, they likely inhabit different spaces, Litwin added.</p><p>"It is becoming more difficult to fully understand someone who is only a few years younger than you, let alone a couple of decades," he said. </p><p>That generational disconnect is clear in the slang terms people are now trying to decode. Here are some of the top searches:</p><p>The phrase, which comes from the song "Doot Doot (6 7)" by rapper Skrilla, was the most-searched slang term with 141,000 lookups. It doesn't actually have any defined meaning, according to reports, but has come to symbolize the "brain rot" culture caused by endless scrolling online. It later became a meme with basketball player LaMelo Ball, who stands at 6 feet, 7 inches, appearing in edited videos about it.</p><p>With 115,000 searches, "bop" is a derogatory term used to describe someone who jumps from one romantic partner to another. Unscramblerer.com notes the word often appears in cyberbullying contexts.</p><p>"Mogging," which drew nearly 80,000 searches, means outshining others in terms of looks, skill or success. A related term, "looksmaxxing," focuses on maximizing one’s appearance, emphasizing features such as the jawline, eyes and physique, the BBC reported.</p><p>A flirty term for an attractive girl or group of girls, "huzz" was searched more than 61,000 times this year, quickly replacing other terms of endearment like "boo" or "bae." </p><p>Social media, especially TikTok, has shortened the lifespan of slang, Litwin said. "In the rapidly changing digital world, these words are prone to fade from popularity almost as fast as they took off, being overtaken by new words and expressions."</p><p>Chopped, which had 59,000 searches, is a synonym commonly used on TikTok for someone who is ugly or unattractive. It is the opposite of other Gen Z and Gen Alpha terms like "ate" and "served," which are used to praise someone who nailed a look or performance.</p><p>"Big back" is a slang term with more than 57,000 searches used to describe someone with a large upper body or who is overweight, often in a teasing or mocking way. It can also be used humorously, as in "I need to unbig my back," or to describe hearty eaters, with phrases like "big back behavior."</p><p>"Glazing," which saw more than 49,000 searches, means giving over-the-top compliments. Merriam-Webster defines it as showering someone with "excessive praise," often referring to the way fans fawn over celebrities or athletes online.</p><p>Calling someone "zesty" is a compliment, meaning they are fun, lively and full of energy, and it was searched 44,000 times. It is a synonym for "snazzy" and can also refer to someone having a positive outlook on life, according to a Reddit thread for English language learners. </p><p>The term "fanum tax," searched more than 36,000 times, refers to playfully stealing food off a friend’s plate or taking something of theirs while feeling entitled to it. The phrase comes from internet personality Fanum and has been popularized by streamers.</p><p>"Green FN," which was searched 34,000 times, means a guaranteed win or success. The term comes from the NBA 2K video game, where a perfectly timed shot turns green.</p><p>"Delulu," which racked up 32,000 searches, is short for "delusional." The term originated in K-pop communities, where fans jokingly called themselves "delulu" for believing their idols might date them, according to Merriam-Webster. The term also appears in the 2024 song "Nissan Altima," in which rapper Doechii sings, "You delulu, you a loose screw," and has even been added to the Cambridge Dictionary.</p><p>Clanker, searched 29,000 times, is a slur aimed at robots and AI technology, according to Urban Dictionary. While it gained popularity this year, it dates back to around 2005 and the "Star Wars" franchise, referencing the clanking sound robots make, one linguist told NPR.</p><p>Unfortunately for residents of the Buckeye State, "Ohio" — with more than 24,000 searches — is Gen Z and Gen Alpha slang for anything weird, awkward or absurd. The term evolved from the late-2010s "Only in Ohio" meme trend that mocked odd events supposedly happening there.</p><p>"Slop," which drew about 21,000 searches, describes poor-quality AI-generated content — including writing, art or videos flooding social media and search engines. As "spam" refers to junk email, "slop" has become shorthand for low-effort, machine-made content, according to The New York Times.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Shedeur Sanders' mom sends cryptic message amid son's promotion for Browns</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The mother of Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders referenced her son in a mysterious Instagram comment Friday after news broke that the rookie had been elevated to the team's backup quarterback role. </p><p>Pilar Sanders posted a video of her in the kitchen making a massive seafood spread that included fried shrimp and lobster. The top comment on the post asked her, "Are you cooking all that for Shedeur being named QB2?"</p><p>The mother responded with a cryptic statement. </p><p>"For Shedeur’s yes - we know 2 has always been 1 - the matrix will try to make u believe anything hahahahah - never fall for tall tales," she wrote. She did not clarify or specify what she was referring to. </p><p>Sanders, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, who coached him at the University of Colorado, has been the subject of immense media scrutiny and speculation dating back to when he was drafted in April. </p><p>After the Browns traded veteran quarterback Joe Flacco to the Cincinnati Bengals earlier this week, fans and pundits speculated whether Sanders would be elevated to the second-string job or remain in the third-string role behind Bailey Zappe. </p><p>The quarterback was the subject of one of the most shocking slides in NFL Draft history in April, when he fell from a potential No. 1 overall expectation to the 144th pick in the fifth round. </p><p>The Tuesday before the draft, NFL Media released a summary of the top 18 prospects in this year's class. </p><p>Sanders' section included comments from an anonymous assistant coach who said Sanders was "the worst formal interview I've ever been in in my life. He's so entitled. He takes unnecessary sacks. He never plays on time. He has horrible body language. He blames teammates. … But the biggest thing is, he's not that good."</p><p>An anonymous longtime executive added, "It didn't go great in our interview. He wants to dictate what he's going to do and what's best for him. He makes you feel small."</p><p>NFL Hall of Famer Eric Dickerson stoked conspiracy theories related to Sanders in an August interview, claiming that NFL teams were "told not to" draft Sanders to "make an example" of the quarterback when he fell to the fifth round. </p><p>"I tell you this much, what I heard from someone that's in the NFL [is] that the NFL told [teams], 'Don't draft him. Do not draft him,'" Dickerson said in an interview on the "Roggin and Rodney" show on AM 570 LA Sports. </p><p>"'We're going to make an example out of him.' And this came from a very good source, a very good source. They were going to have him not get drafted to basically show you 'this is what happens when you do this.' I mean, look, the NFL's got all kinds of power. They do all kinds of stuff." </p><p>Sanders' slide out of the first round shocked many, including President Trump, who sent a post on Truth Social condemning the league's owners for passing on the quarterback. </p><p>"What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID? Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He’s also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness," Trump wrote. "He should be "picked" IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN. Good luck Shedeur, and say hello to your wonderful father!"</p><p>ESPN host Stephen A. Smith revealed a text message from an associate who compared the situation to Colin Kaepernick being out of the NFL since 2016, suggesting "collusion." </p><p>"'This is a bad look for the NFL. This feels like Kaepernick-level collusion,'" Smith said of the content of the text, adding the situation goes beyond "talent evaluation." </p><p>"All the hard work the NFL League Office puts in to eradicate these kinds of perceptions, only to turn around and watch as the OWNERS look like they’re colluding, messing up everything. What has been done to Shedeur will outshine everything else in this draft. We’ll never believe this is about just talent evaluation again." </p><p>Sanders has yet to get into an NFL regular-season game, but his first action could come as soon as this Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers if starter and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel has to exit the game for any reason. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Former Jet relives memories with franchise, says it 'feels like' there's a 'curse' with today's team</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The New York Jets remain the only winless team in the NFL despite whatever positives new head coach Aaron Glenn wants to tell the press and fans about.</p><p>Ahead of the Jets' 37-22 loss to the Dallas Cowboys last week, Glenn preached that a recent practice leading up to the game was one of their best. Earlier this week, he praised the team for the bonding players had done in their hotel in London as they prepared to face the Denver Broncos.</p><p>In all likelihood, the Jets' playoff drought will reach a 16th consecutive season, and at this point, "it feels like there’s probably a curse," former Jets wide receiver Eric Decker said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.</p><p></p><p>However, it was not always like that.</p><p>Decker spent three seasons with Gang Green, and in his second season, they went 10-6 but missed the playoffs. During that season, Decker did not get "cursed" vibes and actually reflected fondly on his time in East Rutherford.</p><p>"The teams I was on, we had a good squad, had a chance to make the playoffs, and we lost it ourselves. To win 10 games and not make it was crazy. But inside, to me, everyone inside the facility was all in and did their part and gave players the opportunity," Decker said. </p><p>"No, I didn’t feel that. I didn’t feel like 'Here we go again; it’s the Jets’ or this aura about it. It’s just little thing by little thing that adds up in the NFL. Those things are the deciding factor. </p><p>"They got a pretty good team, and I like that coach. It’s all about mentality, which seems like it needs to be changed from the outside, but being inside, you don’t have that thought process."</p><p>Glenn certainly has that mentality, but the results are not there. Decker, however, believes the Jets just need to control the "controllables."</p><p>"Today’s culture in football, it’s like, if you don’t perform right now, we’re moving on. That’s a lot of pressure for a coach and for players. When guys are not showing up on time or the lack of effort, a lot of those things are controllable. That’s a red flag. 'What’s going on inside? There’s obviously a lack of leadership or a shakeup that way,’" Decker said. </p><p>"But if guys are doing the right thing and giving 100%, performance is a little bit more tricky, because it’s not necessarily as controllable.</p><p>"I think it will turn," he added. "It’s just a matter of someone leading that charge at the helm."</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">NY Times advice column tells liberal reader to develop empathy for rural friend with Trump-supporting husband</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The New York Times Magazine’s "The Ethicist" advice column suggested that a liberal reader — seeking guidance on how to handle a friend living in a deep-red rural town with her Trump-supporting husband, whom he felt wasn’t politically active enough — should respond with empathy.</p><p>The anonymous reader explained his situation to columnist Kwame Anthony Appiah Saturday.</p><p>"I’m an H.I.V.-positive gay man who is distraught with where the country is headed, so I am actively participating in protests. I have a liberal friend who lives in an overwhelmingly Trump-supporting small town and is married to a Trump supporter," the reader seeking advice wrote.</p><p>"She messages me often about her fears of what is going on and seems equally distraught. I’ve shared with her how current politics could affect my life and how, although I’m very aware of my privilege, I’m concerned about people who aren’t as privileged and how they could be affected."</p><p>The reader continued his critiques, chastising his friend for only sharing her political beliefs on social media rather than attending protests in her small rural town.</p><p>"She comes off to me as someone who’s comfortable in her life and doesn’t want to shake anything up, which is the height of hypocrisy to me," he added. "I feel like apathy is how we got here in the first place, and I’m really struggling with how and whether to keep people like this in my life."</p><p>The Ethicist noted that, for those who live in large urban cities in the U.S., attending progressive protests is about as "contentious as an ice cream social" and "cost-free" for its participants.</p><p>"Most people you know will be pleased to see you out there."</p><p>"For her, in a small Trump-supporting town, it’s another story. Neighbors who see her at a protest are neighbors she’ll see at the supermarket and the school board. That could mean living with their disapproval; it could also mean ostracism," Appiah pointed out. "And unlike in cities, where numbers can swell to visibility, protests in small, homogeneous towns may achieve little beyond reinforcing the majority’s sense that the minority is odd or out of step."</p><p>Responding to the reader's assertion that her friend's unwillingness to fully express her political beliefs is the "height of hypocrisy," The Ethicist questioned whether it's fair to label her friend a hypocrite.</p><p>"Hypocrisy means professing beliefs you don’t hold. She shares your views but confronts some very different costs when it comes to public action," he explained. "And then, because she’s married to a Trump supporter, those costs run right through her daily life."</p><p>While the reader claimed that "apathy is how we got here," Appiah suggested that some researchers would say that "condescension played a part" in how he approached his friend's situation.</p><p>"The political scientist Katherine Cramer, for example, has explored how rural resentment has been fueled by perceptions of urban disdain," he noted.</p><p>In his closing remarks, The Ethicist offered a humbling reflection, suggesting perhaps it's the reader's friend who should rethink their relationship, not the reader.</p><p>"As you ask whether to keep people like your low-key friend in your life, I fear that the failure of empathy here is on your side. Your small-town friend may have assessed her circumstances more carefully than you give her credit for. Maybe the question is whether she should keep someone in her life who refuses to consider that possibility," Appiah concluded.</p><p>In November 2024, after the presidential election, "The Ethicist" column responded to a reader question about how Democratic voters should deal with close relatives who supported Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris. </p><p>"I strongly oppose Trump, as do my wife and her family, who live nearby. I’m troubled by my mother’s support of someone I consider morally abhorrent and dangerous, especially when she voted in a former swing state," the person seeking advice wrote. </p><p>"With the result of the 2024 election, my wife and her family are directing their understandable fury at my mother. My wife’s sister said, ‘‘If she voted for Trump again, I’m completely done with her.’’ I expect that the next time they interact it will not be pretty."</p><p>The Ethicist tackled a similar question in October 2024, answering a reader's question about whether it is appropriate to leave the country if the "wrong" candidate becomes president. </p><p>In February 2025, a reader asked the advice column whether a "straight White dude" can date "women of color" to "combat racism."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Alabama Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban said NIL — the name, image and likeness of NCAA student-athletes — has hurt the SEC, the conference he coached in for a long time.</p><p>Saban, 73, coached for a couple of years in the NIL era before retiring at the end of the 2023 season. The legendary coach said NIL helps schools up North in terms of recruiting. </p><p>"I do think that the culture in college football right now, with name, image and likeness (NIL) and paying players money, has actually maybe hurt the SEC a little bit and helped the schools up North," Saban said during a recent appearance on "The Pat McAfee Show" per On3.com.</p><p>"Because if you’re making your decision about money, and someone is going to pay you more to go to Ohio State or Michigan or wherever it is — And I’m not complaining about that. That’s the way it is. — then these kids are going to be more willing to move."</p><p>Saban said NIL has changed the culture of college football because high school recruits now want to play for whichever team will pay them the most. </p><p>"Kids are not growing up wanting to go to Alabama, wanting to go to Georgia, wanting to go to Florida, wanting to go to Texas. They want to go wherever to who is going to pay them the most money," Saban said. </p><p>"So, I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with that. I’m just saying that culture (of college football) has changed, which I think has made the regional advantage that the Southeastern Conference has had for years is no longer an advantage."</p><p>Saban’s assessment may be accurate since an SEC team has not played for a national title since the 2022 season. The last two national championships were won by Big Ten teams — Michigan in 2023 and Ohio State in 2024.</p><p>Saban has said in the past that NIL is not the reason he retired, but he has been adamant in his belief that changes need to be made. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Golf legend Phil Mickelson shared his reaction to news the late Charlie Kirk will posthumously receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom on what would have been Kirk's 32nd birthday, Oct. 14.</p><p>Mickelson sent an X post on Saturday, sharing the news with his thoughts. </p><p>"His presence and message will live forever but I still wish he was here. This award is well deserved," Mickelson wrote. </p><p>Mickelson has been a staunch celebrator of Kirk's life since the conservative activist's assassination in Utah last month. Mickelson has also taken aim at those who have made inflammatory comments in the aftermath of Kirk's death. </p><p>"The assassination of Charlie Kirk is bringing out some of the best in humanity and it’s also exposing some of the worst," he wrote on X in response to a statement from the president of the Oxford Union last month. "The unification, love, support, and outcry on his behalf throughout the world is heartwarming. </p><p>"The number of people supporting Tyler Robinson’s appalling behavior has opened my eyes to a side of extremism with a moral superiority complex that has also shaken my belief in people in general. I hope they are held accountable for their disgusting rhetoric."</p><p>Mickelson also shared a post featuring one of Kirk’s debates. The talk with another student featured Kirk shutting down a college-aged man and his "hate" for billionaires like President Donald Trump and Elon Musk.</p><p>"His ability to use words and his intellect to win debates is what scared them," Mickelson wrote.</p><p>Mickelson also took aim at Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., after the controversial congresswoman insulted Kirk and his legacy in a CNN interview. </p><p>During the interview on CNN, Omar addressed her recent social media posts in which she called Kirk "Dr. Frankenstein," doubling down on those comments and saying his legacy should be left in the "dustbin of history." </p><p>"What I find jarring is that there's so many people willing to excuse the most reprehensible things that he said, that they agree with that, that they're willing to have monuments for him, that they want to create a day to honor him and that they want to produce resolutions in the House of Congress honoring his life and legacy," Omar said.  </p><p>"I am not going to sit here and be judged for not wanting to honor any legacy this man has left behind, that should be in the dustbin of history, and we should hopefully move on and forget the hate that he spewed every single day." </p><p>Mickelson responded to Omar's comments in a post on X, saying he hopes she's "sent back to Somalia soon." </p><p>"Ilhan spews hate every time she opens her mouth, she came here fraudulently and will hopefully be sent back to Somalia soon," Mickelson wrote. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Hollywood legend Diane Keaton has died at the age of 79 in California. </p><p>The actress's family has requested privacy at this time, People magazine reported.</p><p>Keaton was known for her performances in "The Godfather" films and her role in "Annie Hall" in 1977, for which she won the Oscar for best actress. </p><p>Keaton's acting career spanned over six decades across film, television and theater. She was the recipient of one Academy Award, two Golden Globe Awards and one BAFTA Award, and some of her hit movies included "The First Wives Club," "Baby Boom" and "Something’s Gotta Give."</p><p>Born Diane Hall in Los Angeles Jan. 5, 1946, Keaton was the eldest of four children. Her father, John Hall, was a civil engineer and real estate broker, while her mother, Dorothy Keaton Hall, was a homemaker and amateur photographer. </p><p>After studying acting at Santa Ana College, Keaton decided to pursue a career in theater and moved to New York City, where she joined the cast of the Broadway musical "Hair" in 1968. </p><p>In 1969, she landed her first major role on Broadway in "Play It Again, Sam," playing the romantic lead opposite Woody Allen, who also wrote the script. Keaton earned a Tony Award nomination for her performance as Linda Christie. </p><p>Keaton made her film debut in the 1970's "Love and Other Strangers." She went on to reprise her role as Linda in the 1972 film adaptation of "Play It Again, Sam," which also starred Allen and marked the beginning of their longtime movie collaboration. </p><p>The actress made her career breakthrough in 1972 after she starred as Kay Adams Corleone, the wife of Al Pacino's Michael Corleone, in Francis Ford Coppola’s iconic "The Godfather." She reprised her role in the film’s sequels, 1974's Academy Award-winning "The Godfather Part II" and the 1990's "The Godfather Part III." </p><p>Keaton rose to stardom when she played the titular character in the 1977 movie "Annie Hall," earning an Academy Award for her performance as the free-spirited aspiring singer. Allen co-wrote and directed the film while starring as Annie's love interest. </p><p>"Annie Hall" also had significant cultural impact as Keaton's menswear-inspired wardrobe of vests, trousers and hats, which was directly inspired by her own personal style, became iconic and influenced women’s fashion in the late 1970s.</p><p>In addition to "Play It Again, Sam" and "Annie Hall," Keaton and Allen collaborated on six other films, including "Sleeper" (1973), "Love and Death" (1975), "Interiors" (1978), "Manhattan" (1979), "Radio Days" (1987) and "Manhattan Murder Mystery."</p><p>Following the success of "Annie Hall," Keaton starred in the 1977 drama "Looking for Mr. Goodbar," receiving her first Golden Globe nomination for her performance. In the 1980s, she starred in a string of acclaimed movies, including Warren Beatty’s historical epic "Reds," which earned Keaton her second Oscar nomination. </p><p>In 1987, she played the leading role in the comedy "Baby Boom," written by Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer. She later teamed up again with Meyers for the 1991 comedy "Father of the Bride," starring opposite Steve Martin, and reprised her role in the 1995 sequel "Father of the Bride II." </p><p>She went on to star in the critically acclaimed 1996 drama "Marvin's Room," earning her third Oscar nomination. That same year, Keaton appeared alongside Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler in the hit ensemble comedy "The First Wives Club." </p><p>In 2003, Keaton made her late-career comeback in the romantic comedy drama with Meyers' "Something’s Gotta Give," co-starring Jack Nicholson. The movie was a critical and box-office success, and Keaton received her fourth Oscar nomination for her performance. </p><p>She continued regularly appearing in films, often in romantic or ensemble comedies, including "The Family Stone" (2005), "Because I Said So" (2007), "Mad Money" (2008), "Morning Glory" (2010), "Book Club" (2018) and "Poms" (2019), among others. </p><p>After "Book Club" became a surprise hit, Keaton re-teamed with co-stars Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen and Mary Steenburgen for the 2023 sequel "Book Club: The Next Chapter." She made her final film appearance in the 2024 comedy "Summer Camp," opposite Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard. </p><p>Although best known for her film work, Keaton built an acclaimed career in television. The actress received an Emmy Award nomination for her role in the 1984 miniseries "The Little Drummer Girl" and later earned critical praise for her portrayal of aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart in the 1994 television film "Amelia Earhart: The Final Flight," which she also produced.</p><p>Keaton appeared in the TV movies "Sister Mary Explains It All" (2001) and "On Thin Ice" (2003). She made her return to television in 2016 with HBO’s "The Young Pope," portraying Sister Mary, the nun who raised Jude Law’s Pope Pius XIII.</p><p>Behind the camera, Keaton directed films including "Heaven" (1987) and "Unstrung Heroes" (1995) and was a passionate photographer and preservationist of American architecture. </p><p>She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2005. In 2017, she received the AFI Life Achievement Award honoring her six decades of work. </p><p>Keaton never married, but later in life she adopted two children, a daughter, Dexter, in 1996 and a son, Duke, in 2001.</p><p>On Saturday, a source told People magazine that Keaton had struggled with health issues over the last few months.  </p><p>"She declined very suddenly, which was heartbreaking for everyone who loved her," a friend of Keaton's told the outlet. "It was so unexpected, especially for someone with such strength and spirit.</p><p>"In her final months, she was surrounded only by her closest family, who chose to keep things very private," the insider added. "Even longtime friends weren’t fully aware of what was happening."</p><p>People reported that Keaton surprised many when she listed her "dream home" in Los Angeles. The five-bedroom, seven-bathroom house in Los Angeles hit the market for $25 million in March. </p><p>She is survived by her children. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Was a police search for a murder weapon cut short by a guard dog's growl?</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>"Willow," a black and white female pit bull mix loved by her owners, didn't seem destined to become a key figure in a murder investigation. But that's exactly what happened. It was Aug. 12, 2023, when the dog became known to law enforcement in New Haven, Indiana.</p><p>That morning, police would hear about Willow, and how she was a protective guard dog. But they wouldn't meet her. And that's one of many places where this story gets fascinating as correspondent Peter Van Sant reports in "A Death in the Stairwell," an all-new "48 Hours" now streaming on Paramount+. </p>
<p>Willow belonged to Kevin and Alison Davis, a married couple. Steve Krause, Alison Davis' father, tells Van Sant how much Kevin and Alison loved each other, calling each other "babe." Alison Davis' best friend, Kasey Klemm, says they were a happy couple who danced together in the kitchen. Krause explains, "They had no children, so the dog was … like a child" to them. Their friend, Jason Young, says that Willow was "a big barker and kind of intimidating at first," but that in "two minutes the dog doesn't care about you anymore."</p><p>The night Kevin Davis sustained his injuries, he and Alison Davis had been out together at a local tavern. Friends and the tavern staff say it was a typical night and that they seemed happy when they headed home around 1 a.m. Alison Davis would later tell police that when they did get home, she and Kevin had an argument, so she went to sleep on a couch downstairs. Kevin Davis headed to their upstairs bedroom – where Willow was too. Alison Davis says she was awakened by a loud noise. She says she found Kevin Davis unresponsive, face down, in a large pool of blood. Alison Davis would tell a 911 operator and first responders that Kevin Davis had fallen down the stairs.</p>
<p>After emergency responders rushed Kevin Davis to the hospital, Det. James Krueger would question Alison Davis. She would sign paperwork, giving consent to police to enter and search the home. But Alison Davis warned the detective about Willow: "She's a guard dog. I don't know if she'd do anything, and I don't want anything to happen to her," said Alison Davis. </p>
<p>Krueger told her he wouldn't go in that room. He says when he went upstairs, "I could hear the dog walking around in there … So I cracked the door open … I got the teeth, and the growls and everything. And there was no way that dog was letting me in that room." Krueger looked around the rest of the house. He felt "everything checked out" and that Alison Davis' story was true — this was a tragic, fatal fall. </p><p>Kevin Davis had massive traumatic injuries to his head. He would not survive another day. Family and friends say Alison Davis was devastated by the loss of the husband she loved. But police came to think differently. Four months later, Indiana authorities would charge Alison Davis with murder. Detective Krueger concluded, "This is a wife that lost it and beat her husband to death." Authorities say she used an improvised weapon, like an exercise weight, perhaps a baseball bat. But no weapon was ever found. </p><p>After 17 months of incarceration, Alison Davis — who has always maintained her innocence — would go on trial for murder. In just six hours, the jury would come to its verdict. Alison Davis is not guilty. </p><p>Krueger, who had been promoted to chief of police, believes the verdict might have been different if only he had gotten into Willow's room that August morning. "I think that dog may have been intentionally put in that room to keep me out," Krueger tells Van Sant. Krueger adds, there could have been "the blunt force object … in that room … something in that room that would've helped with the case."</p>
<p>After the trial, a juror told Van Sant that the prosecution's case "had a lot of holes." And that there were strong reasons why the jury had voted to acquit Alison Davis. Still, Police Chief Krueger says he will always wonder if there could have been a murder weapon in Willow's room.</p><p>"There's no evidence … It's unbelievable. Such injustice," says Krause. "This is just strictly an accident."</p><p>Alison Davis is free, now living with her mother and father. She's trying to put her life back together, without Kevin, the man her dad says always called her "babe." And by her side, as she always has been, is Willow. </p>

<div class="article-title">5 hospitalized after helicopter crashes in busy oceanfront area of Huntington Beach</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Five people, including a child, were hospitalized when a helicopter crashed in the Southern California city of Huntington Beach on Saturday afternoon. </p><p>It happened just after 2 p.m. local time near a parking lot off Pacific Coast Highway, between Beach Boulevard and Twin Dolphins Drive, according to Huntington Beach firefighters. </p><p>City officials tell CBS News that the two people on the helicopter were safely pulled from the wreckage. Three pedestrians on the street were also injured in the incident, and all five people were taken to the hospital for treatment. None of their conditions was known.</p>
<p>Police closed PCH between Huntington Street and Beach Boulevard at around 3 p.m., as they began to investigate the crash. They asked people to avoid the area and use alternate routes for at least several hours after the closure was put into place. </p><p>A dramatic video posted on social media shows the helicopter spinning several times before crashing into palm trees and the outdoor stairway of the pedestrian bridge that runs over PCH to the Hyatt Regency Huntington Beach Resort and Spa. </p><p>Other video footage shows an object falling from the helicopter moments before it plummeted from the sky. </p>
<p>With SkyCal over the scene, scattered debris was seen in the beach access parking lot, a large part of which was blocked off by police tape. The tail of the aircraft broke off in the crash, with the rest of the helicopter still wedged between the staircase and palm trees as of 4:30 p.m.</p><p>There were several other small helicopters parked in the parking lot near where the crash happened, just in front of the Hyatt Regency and Waterfront Beach Resort. An "exclusive helicopter landing party" was being hosted by MD Helicopters at the Offshore 9 Rooftop Lounge on Saturday afternoon, where attendees were invited to "watch helicopters arrive from a bird's eye view." The landing party was scheduled ahead of the Cars 'N Copters On the Coast main event on Sunday.</p><p>Event organizers said that the event was not going to be canceled. </p><p>"We are sending our prayers out to all involved in the unfortunate incident today," said a statement. "Our plan for now is to move forward with our event tomorrow, Sunday, October 12th. We will advise everyone at the earliest possible opportunity if that plan changes."</p>
<p>Witnesses said that the helicopter appeared to dip towards the bridge before it lost control and crashed. </p><p>"You can hear this odd sound that didn't sound right," said Kevin Bullat, who saw the scene unfold. "I looked out and I see the helicopter spiraling out of control. ... My friend saw shrapnel, or just debris, catapulting across PCH."</p><p>It's unclear what caused the helicopter to crash. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have been notified of the crash, city officials said. </p><p>The helicopter was a Bell 222, which is powered by two turboshaft engines, and was manufactured in 1980</p>

<div class="article-title">A wife is accused of her husband's murder. Can she clear her name?</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>August 12, 2023, New Haven, Indiana. Shortly before morning broke in the home he rented with his wife Alison, at the base of a steep stairway, <span class="link">Kevin Davis</span>' blood seeped onto the floor.</p><blockquote><p>OFFICER GARRETT SHANEBROOK | New Haven Police Department (bodycam video): Where's that blood coming from? </p><p>CORPORAL CADE HETRICK | New Haven Police Department: His face and his nose.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: The amount of blood, it was alarming. It was — it was everywhere.</p><p>Alison Davis had already given lead Detective James Krueger of the New Haven Police Department permission to search the house.</p><blockquote><p>DET. JAMES KRUEGER (bodycam video):  If you do agree to that, I need you to sign there saying that you understand …</p></blockquote><p>But she warned them about the bedroom, where their pit bull mix, Willow, would sometimes growl at strangers who approached.</p><blockquote><p>ALISON DAVIS (bodycam video): She's up in the bedroom, and she's a guard dog.</p><p>DET. JAMES KRUEGER: OK.</p><p>ALISON DAVIS: And I don't know if she'd do anything, and I don't want anything to happen to her.</p><p>DET. JAMES KRUEGER: Right now, what I won't do is, I won't go in that room.</p><p>ALISON DAVIS: OK.</p></blockquote><h2></h2><h2>AN ACCIDENTAL FALL?</h2><p>Kevin had been rushed to Parkview Regional Medical Center in critical condition. After speaking with first responders and breaking the tragic news to her loved ones, Alison also headed to Parkview.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: So you go to the hospital?</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>Steve Krause watched his daughter try to will Kevin back to consciousness.</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: Their favorite phrase for one another was "babe." … And Alison's up there, "Hey babe you're gonna be OK. Hey babe, you know, I'm here with you. Hey babe, I love you."</p>
<p><strong>Kasey Klemm</strong>: She had like blood on her fingernail, cuticles, and on her phone. I could tell that she had been crying but she kind of just looked like in shock.</p><p>Alison's best friend Kasey Klemm.</p>
<p><strong>Kasey Klemm</strong>: They had her in like a little small waiting room with a chaplain. And I was trying to calm her down to ask questions, you know, like what was going on?</p><p>Back at the house, Krueger lifted restrictions and cleared the bloody scene. It was horrific. But at this point, he believed it was an accident.</p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger:</strong> Well, maybe he took a head plant down the stairs. I don't know. I wasn't there. </p><p><strong>Kasey Klemm</strong>: The detective said … I think we're done here.</p><p>Alison stayed at the hospital. But back home, all that blood needed to be cleaned up.</p><p><strong>Kasey Klemm</strong>: You don't think about that right? … Like, who cleans it up?</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: I said well, I will go do it. </p>
<p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: You had permission to do this?</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: Correct.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Permission from the lead detective in this case?</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: Correct.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: How upsetting was this process of cleaning?</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: Well it's very upsetting. … sometimes I'd get — become overwhelmed and need to gather myself, um, to finish, um, what I'd come to do.</p><p>Including tending to Willow, who had been left upstairs in their bedroom with the door closed.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: Alison was concerned that this dog hadn't been left out … They had no children, so the dog was … like a child.</p><p>Throughout that frantic morning, Alison and her family quietly prayed.</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: I'm praying can we just, you know, wake up, you know, wake up. You look like you're sleeping, just wake up.</p><p>Kevin and Alison were a part of a tight group of friends who were regulars at the East Haven Tavern where Jodi Espy and Jessica Eakright take care of the crowd. </p><p><strong>Jessica Eakright</strong>: Our customers become our family around here.</p><p>The news that Kevin was in critical condition hit hard.</p><p><strong>Jodi Espy</strong>: Everybody was just talking like, "Oh my gosh, he was just here. That's so sad."</p>
<p>Kevin and Alison had been at the Tavern just hours earlier.</p><p><strong>Jessica Eakright</strong>: It was hard not to be a friend of Alison's because she just made everybody feel like you mattered. </p><p>Kevin, a skilled landscaper, had a big personality that matched his big heart. </p><p><strong>Todd Spessert</strong>: Kevin Davis was, uh, just a nice guy … always hard working … ready to help anybody out at any time. </p><p>Close friends Todd Spessert and Jason Young scrambled to see Kevin. </p><p><strong>Jason Young</strong>: We all met at the hospital.</p><p><strong>Todd Spessert</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Young</strong>: We talked to Alison and her parents.</p><p><strong>Jason Young</strong>: … definitely she had been crying, but she was holding back.</p><p><strong>Todd Spessert</strong>: She was —  she was a mess.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: She was devastated?</p><p><strong>Jason Young and Todd Spessert:</strong> Yes.</p><p>The scene was overwhelming.</p><p><strong>Todd Spessert</strong>: Yeah, he … he's uh brain dead, there's nothing left in there.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>:  God, just a few hours earlier he was sitting right over here, right?</p><p><strong>Todd Spessert</strong>: Correct.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Do you say anything to Kevin?</p><p><strong>Jason Young:</strong> Oh yeah, yup. … I told him it's like … I feel really bad about this. And it shouldn't have happened, and wish you were still here. </p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: And did you have a chance to say goodbye to your friend?</p><p><strong>Jason Young</strong>: Yeah. I said goodbye there. Yep.</p><p><strong>Todd Spessert</strong>: They were — yeah, then they were talking about, you know, donating his organs and stuff. And I was like — I was like, wow.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: He was an organ donor?</p><p><strong>Kasey Klemm</strong>: Yes, yes. She was very proud of him for that, too.</p><p>His life support would be disconnected. Soon, 40-year-old Kevin Davis was gone. At 33, Alison was a widow.</p><p><strong>Kasey Klemm</strong>: They were just happy type of couple that would dance in the kitchen to music together, just the two of them. Like that's just who they were. They were great together.</p><p>It shook their friend Deontae Bristol.</p><p><strong>Deontae Bristol</strong>: I was just holding back tears because we were just hanging out. Like I was just hanging out with this guy.</p><p><strong>Jessica Eakright</strong>: It's devastating. Not just because he's no longer here, but because the circumstances surrounding it are traumatic.</p>
<p><strong>Deontae Bristol</strong>: It had to be an accident.</p><p><strong>Jodi Espy</strong>: Nobody ever thought it was anything but a fall.</p>
<p>And that's what Krueger concluded, too. </p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: I just didn't see any need in a small department to tie up all our resources and hold the house for an accident scene. </p><p>But the scene did raise questions. Despite a huge amount of blood, first responders didn't see any lacerations on Kevin's head.</p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: I was just told that he was bleeding out of his … nose and mouth … there was no obvious wound on the side of his head. </p><p>That same day, a doctor at Parkview treating Kevin felt compelled to speak up.</p>
<p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: One of the doctors of the ER staff … had some concerns with those injuries.</p><p>The CT scans showed internal wounds — multiple skull fractures. She also noted bruising to his face and scalp and concluded, "Kevin's injuries were not consistent with a fall down a stairway." </p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: That … definitely raised some red flags in my mind.</p><p>She alerted the coroner's office, who ordered an autopsy.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant: </strong>When did this accident scene become a crime scene?</p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: After the autopsy. … Once they told me that he had a crushed-in skull … definitely is not consistent with a fall from the stairs. … that's when I started … to dig a lot … deeper into this case.</p><h2>KEVIN DAVIS' AUTOPSY RESULTS RAISE SUSPICIONS</h2><p>Three days after Kevin's death, the autopsy was completed and the provocative findings were turned over to police.</p>
<p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: I get the autopsy report … saying that his skull is crushed in, definitely is not consistent with a fall from the stairs.</p><p>But Krueger says it is consistent with a violent physical beating.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: And you now are going … we may have a homicide on our hands.</p><p><strong>James Krueger</strong>: Right.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Do you have a suspect in this case?</p><p><strong>James Krueger</strong>: Yeah, Alison's definitely our suspect. … You have two people in a house. One is murdered.</p><p>It seemed a routine step to launch the murder investigation of Alison Davis. But the New Haven Police Department had a huge challenge — created by its own decision.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: By releasing the scene that meant that family members could – </p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: That meant that anybody —</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>:  — reenter the house …</p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: — yeah, the house is back to her.  </p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: But when people other than law enforcement enter a house once it's been released there's a problem right?</p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: There is.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: There can be contamination of a crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: Yeah.</p><p>The day after police received the autopsy, four days after Kevin's death, Krueger got a search warrant. That same day and the next he returned to the house, a bodycam rolling.</p><blockquote><p>DET. JAMES KRUEGER (bodycam video): I have a couple more search warrants here, OK? First one is I gotta take your phone from ya.</p><p>ALISON DAVIS: OK.</p></blockquote><p>Police had been looking for more evidence -- including a possible murder weapon or traces of blood. But by then, Alison's dad had already straightened up as best he could.</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: I basically cleaned up the area that I could visually see blood. And it was around where Kevin was on the floor. … It's right there at the bottom of the steps.</p><blockquote><p>DET. JAMES KRUEGER (bodycam video): So if I could gather the phone first?</p><p>ALISON DAVIS: Yes, let me grab that.</p></blockquote><p>Alison shared with Klemm a growing unease she couldn't shake.</p><p><strong>Kasey Klemm</strong>: She was really upset that they took their phones …</p><blockquote><p>DET. JAMES KRUEGER (bodycam video): Is that password protected?</p><p>ALISON DAVIS: Yes.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kasey Klemm</strong>: … cause that was a lot of their memories. … pictures to … look back on.</p>
<p>Alison would say she initially spoke willingly to investigators, doing all police asked of her.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: She would talk to whomever wanted to speak with her, is that right?</p><p><strong>Kasey Klemm:</strong> Yeah. She had nothing to hide. Why would she?</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: There's … nothing that suggests there was anything other than a fall down the stairs.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: And for you this was a tragic accident.</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: Of course … It was!</p><p>And as the spotlight turned to Alison Davis, at the East Haven Tavern, there were plenty who voiced their support.</p>
<p><strong>Jodi Espy</strong>: There's no way.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: There's no way what?</p><p><strong>Jodi Epsy</strong>: That she could've done that, she could've killed him. There's no way.</p><p><strong>Jessica Eakright</strong>: I could not imagine in any world where she would be wanted for murder.</p><p>The tavern crowd tells the story of that night. Alison was working retail at Victoria's Secret. When she finished, she headed over. As usual, Kevin was waiting for her. </p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: On that night … where was he sitting?</p><p><strong>Jodi Espy</strong>: He was sitting over here at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: And his mood that night was?</p><p><strong>Jodi Espy</strong>: Was good, he was happy, he was friendly.</p><p><strong>Jason Young</strong>: I was here with him.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: You were here?</p><p><strong>Jason Young</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p><p>It was around 9 p.m. when Alison walked in.</p><p><strong>Jodi Espy</strong>: Typical night.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Eakright</strong>: There was nothing out of the ordinary in — in the slightest.</p><p>Kevin had a second, then a third beer and some vodka shots. Alison sipped on her usual -- a sweet cocktail.</p><p><strong>Jessica Eakright</strong>: It didn't seem that she was drinking excessively at all. </p><p>The East Haven Tavern regulars carried on. Kevin could get a little loud, his friends say, but they knew, that was just Kevin being Kevin.</p><p><strong>Jodi Espy</strong>: I mean, he was — he was just "a lot."</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: What does "a lot" mean?</p><p><strong>Jodi Espy</strong>: He was very opinionated.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Eakright</strong>: But she — she loved him through it.</p><p>Soon it was after midnight; time to turn in. </p><p><strong>Jessica Eakright</strong>: They were calling it a night, winding down.</p><p>Alison left the tavern first, with Kevin following shortly after.</p><p><strong>Jessica Eakright</strong>: I think it was about one.</p><p>Kevin and his buddy Jason Young started texting.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>:  Now those texts, do you still have them?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Young</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Can you show them to me?</p><p><strong>Jason Young</strong>: Yeah. … You can just start here. You just start scrolling through. …</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: So this starts at 1:11 a.m. …</p><p>Young asked, "You guys make it back?" Kevin responding, "Oh ya sry…. L O L."  A moment later Kevin confides, "Ya we are good bro… I'm just listening to music… L O L."</p><p><strong>Jason Young</strong>: … just being funny, you know … all that was basically going on til … about 2:31.</p><p>But Klemm says, Alison told her it was late, and she had told Kevin to quiet down. She was tired, and all she wanted was to get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Kasey Klemm</strong>: She said, Kevin, I have to get up early for work. … I'm gonna go downstairs and sleep if you don't stop. I need to sleep.</p><p>Kevin sent Jason a seemingly innocent text. </p><p><strong>Jason Young</strong>: He says …  "I'm putting my phone on silent, laugh my ass off, gotta go to bed. <em>The wife.</em>"</p><p>"The Wife." After the autopsy results came back, and Krueger got Alison and Kevin's phones. He  studied that text and the ones before it. He thought they didn't seem innocent at all.</p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: He was obviously annoyed at her about something.</p><p>Remember, Alison had told first responders that they'd had a fight.</p><blockquote><p>ALISON DAVIS (police bodycam): Just now, I woke up, I -- we got in a fight last night …</p></blockquote><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: Who knows what was said. It obviously aggravated her.</p>
<p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: This is a wife that lost it and beat her husband to death.</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: There's nothing to suggest that Alison did anything. … This is just strictly an accident.</p><h2>THE INVESTIGATION FOCUSES ON ALISON DAVIS </h2><p>With evidence showing that Kevin Davis's skull had multiple fractures, everything was being reexamined to determine if those injuries were accidental —or intentional.</p><blockquote><p><em>911 DISPATCHER:  911. What's the address of your emergency?</em></p><p><em>ALISON DAVIS: My husband just fell down the stairs and there's blood everywhere …</em></p><p><em>ALISON DAVIS: … I don't know if he's alive or dead.</em></p></blockquote><p>Detective Krueger's team analyzed that 911 call and concluded Alison was acting.</p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: … this is rehearsed. … Because she wanted to listen to what the 911 dispatcher had to say and then she went into her whole rehearsal.</p><blockquote><p><em>911 DISPATCHER: OK, and what happened to your husband?</em></p><p><em>ALISON DAVIS: Um, he fell down the stairs, just now. I was sleeping downstairs. All I heard -- all of a sudden, I heard a loud noise.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: She never asked them to hurry up. Almost every 911 call you listened to, hey, hurry up, I need you now, you know?</p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: This call is about her. It's not about Kevin.</p>
<p>And even as their bodycams rolled, police officers Hetrick and Shanebrook questioned if Alison was genuinely concerned, as Kevin lay dying.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant:</strong> Typically, based on your experience, how is the spouse reacting in a situation like this?</p><p><strong>Cpl. Cade Hetrick</strong>: Usually just absolute panic.</p><p>And when EMT's lifted Kevin, brain-dead, into an emergency vehicle —</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Did she attempt to get into the ambulance?</p><p><strong>Cpl. Cade Hetrick</strong>: Not once.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Not once. Was she crying?</p>
<p><strong>Cpl. Cade Hetrick</strong>: I — I don't ever recall witnessing her cry.</p><p>But they say they did hear her laughing.</p><p><strong>Officer GarrettShanebrook</strong>: Uh, we both noticed it.</p><p><strong>Cpl. Cade Hetrick</strong>: When she was also talking to the paramedics, my body camera captured her kinda laughing … with the paramedics.</p><blockquote><p>CORPORAL CADE HETRICK (bodycam video): Is there somewhere we can get clothes for ya?</p><p>ALISON DAVIS: Um, cause you can't. I'm not sure.</p><p>CORPORAL CADE HETRICK: Yeah. That's the problem right now, like I said.</p><p>ALISON DAVIS:  I mean, it is what it is at this point.</p><p>CORPORAL CADE HETRICK: OK. OK.</p></blockquote><p>Also strange, to these police officers, is what they observed at the bottom of the stairs.</p><blockquote><p>CORPORAL CADE HETRICK (bodycam video): This just doesn't look like a fall to me.</p><p>OFFICER GARRETT SHANEBROOK: No.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Officer GarrettShanebrook:</strong> If he fell down the stairs why wasn't he more either wedged up against the doorway … not laying perfectly flat in a horizontal position?</p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: It's almost like he was laid down at that base of the stairs. It didn't make sense.</p>
<p>Police would come to think they knew why.</p><p><strong>Cpl. Cade Hetrick</strong>: It didn't add up to a tumble down the stairs.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: What did it add up to you?</p><p><strong>Cpl. Cade Hetrick</strong>: Blunt force trauma …</p><p>A beating, police say — several severe blows to the head until Kevin's skull caved in. </p><blockquote><p>CORPORAL CADE HETRICK (bodycam video): Right now, we're treating this as a crime scene due to his condition, OK? Alright?</p></blockquote><p>Police uncovered something else. Alison told differentstories as to where she and Kevin were sleeping. Remember, first responders heard this story:</p>
<blockquote><p>ALISON DAVIS (bodycam video): We got in a fight last night. And I was sleeping on the couch, and he was sleeping upstairs.</p></blockquote><p>But that's not what investigators say Alison told Kevin's mother, Alta Beers.</p>
<p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: Alta tells me that, um, Alison told her that … they were in bed together … I said, OK, that's interesting.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: But she had told you she was on a couch.</p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: Yeah. Completely different.</p><p>Krueger says Alison didn't share with Kevin's family just how critically he was hurt.</p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: She is minimizing this entire situation, especially to Kevin's family.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Why do you suppose Alison minimized his injuries –</p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: Because she caused the injuries. That's why she minimized them. … She's caught lying …</p>
<p>The detective's theories: the 911 call — faked.</p><blockquote><p><em>ALISON DAVIS (to 911):</em> <em>My husband just fell down the stairs and there's blood everywhere, and I can't flip him over.</em></p></blockquote><p>Alison's behavior — unnatural. Kevin's body — it had been moved.</p><p><strong>Tesa Helge</strong>: It looks to me like he's been positioned in a way that does not consistent with falling down the stairs.</p><p>Prosecutor Tesa Helge teamed with Krueger and the doctors who had treated and examined Kevin.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: So your experts are looking at a man they believed basically was beaten to death.</p><p><strong>Tesa Helge</strong>: That's exactly what they believe.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Beaten by someone.</p>
<p><strong>Tesa Helge</strong>: Right.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: And that someone you believe was?</p><p><strong>Tesa Helge</strong>: Alison Davis.</p><p>But the prosecutor sensed the investigation faced some serious challenges. </p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Where's the murder weapon?</p><p><strong>Tesa Helge</strong>: It's a great question.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: And what triggered this?</p>
<p><strong>Tesa Helge</strong>: Between them? I don't know. I wish I knew.</p><p>But Helge and Krueger became convinced, they had learned something important about Alison and Kevin's marriage that could suggest a motive.</p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: I spoke with Kevin's mother, Alta, and she had informed me that there were having some marital issues.</p><p><strong>Tesa Helge</strong>: You know a domestic relationship that has gone bad … It is on the rocks.</p><p>And remember thesetexts from the final hours of his life between Kevin and his friend Jason Young?</p><p><strong>Jason Young</strong>: He said, "I'm putting my phone on silent, laughin' my ass off, gotta go to bed. The wife."</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Gotta go, the wife.</p>
<p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: The wife.</p><p>Investigators suggested that message reflected tensions in the marriage. Young believes that's ridiculous.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Did he ever say to you my marriage is in trouble.</p><p><strong>Jason Young</strong>: No.</p><p><strong>Kasey Klemm</strong>: She would've told me if there was something going on and never was that hinted.</p><p>Alison's supporters say she was just being honest with investigators when she mentioned the argument. But, with detectives bearing down on her, Alison had stopped talking to them about her marriage or anything else.</p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: She went completely silent after that and uh. </p>
<p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: The cooperation stopped. </p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: Over with, yep, yep.</p><p>On Oct. 17, 2023, after two months of investigation, police declared Kevin's death a homicide. And two months after that, a warrant was issued for Alison's arrest for the murder of her husband.</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: I mean that — this is unbelievable … So we get a recommendation for criminal defense team in Indianapolis. </p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: Andrew Baldwin and Max Wiley. </p><p><strong>Andrew Baldwin</strong>: I spent quite a bit of time with her, and she's just a wonderful person …</p><p>Three days before Christmas, Alison Davis walked into the Allen County Jail with her parents.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: She said … I'm Alison Davis, and I'm here to turn myself in.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Did they handcuff her right in front of you?</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: Yes.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Do you believe Alison Davis had anything to do with her husband's death?</p><p><strong>Max Wiley</strong>: No.</p><p>Wiley and Baldwin thought they knew exactly why cops hadn't found a murder weapon: because there was no murder. </p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: What was the instrument that you believe caused Kevin's death?</p>
<p><strong>Max Wiley:</strong> The banister at the bottom of the stairs.</p><h2>ALISON DAVIS ARRESTED</h2><p>Indiana rarely allows bail on a murder charge. Alison Davis was locked up in the Allen County Jail. She pleaded not guilty.</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: We know Alison. … and we know she isn't capable of what they accused her of.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Does she have a temper?</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: No, she's never has a temper.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Does she have a criminal record?</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: No, she does not have a criminal record.</p>
<p>Her father, Steve, hoped he'd given Alison tools to survive behind bars and face the anxious wait until her trial.</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: Our family is faith-based, and Alison leaned on that faith. </p><p><strong>Kasey Klemm</strong>: It was so hard.</p><p>Kasey Klemm searched desperately for a way to help her friend.</p><p><strong>Kasey Klemm</strong>: It's like there's nothing I can do for her, except pretend to be strong and remind her that I'm here.</p>
<p>While loved ones missed Alison, she told them that she missed Kevin.</p><p><strong>Kasey Klemm</strong>: You know she would say, I haven't been sleeping because I just keep seeing it in my head and … I just miss him and I want him. … and you know she would just talk about how all she wants more than anything in the world is just to hear him call her babe again and hold her.</p>
<p>Friends and family were denied any direct contact.</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: No visitation.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Were you able to see her on a video, Facetime kind of situation?</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: No, we were not.</p><p>Only her attorneys, Max Wiley and Andrew Baldwin, could see Alison. Through plexiglass, they got to know their client and developed a sense of her relationship with Kevin.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Do you buy into this notion that it was a troubled marriage, headed toward a cliff?</p><p><strong>Max Wiley</strong>: Not at all. … No one is coming to the detectives, you know, right after this happened and saying there was a problem in the marriage, you need to investigate this. Nobody.</p>
<p>But remember, four weeks after Kevin died, Krueger spoke with Kevin's mother, Alta. He says she told him Kevin and Alison were having marital problems. </p><p><strong>Det. James Krueger</strong>: It was looking like it was leaning towards a separation.</p><p><strong>Tesa Helge</strong>: I think it's fair to say that he was concerned about the marriage, and that he had shared those concerns with his family.</p><p>As Helge prepared, she believed she had a compelling story to share with a jury. It wasn't about love and marriage —</p><p><strong>Tesa Helge</strong>: This case is going to boil down to a lot of science …</p><p><strong>Dr. Bill Smock</strong>: I'm Dr. Bill Smock. I'm a consultant to the Allen County District Attorney's Office in the death of Mister Davis.</p><p><strong>Tesa Helge</strong>: When I brought Dr. Smock in, and I provided him all our materials … I did not tell him what anyone else thought.</p>
<p>The defense retained a medical expert of its own: Dr. L. J. Dragovic, a forensic pathologist and neuropathologist.</p><p><strong>Max Wiley</strong>: He studies brains. He studies brain injuries. He's passionate about it.</p><p>The two experts would come to radically different conclusions.</p><p><strong>Dr. Bill Smock</strong>: Mr. Davis was beaten to death.</p><p><strong>Dr. L.J. Dragovic</strong>: Kevin Davis died as a result of falling and striking his head … on a bottom post of the stairway banister …</p><p>They worked to make sense of a tragedy that started with a phone call.</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: I have not heard the call.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Would you like to hear it?</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: Sure.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: You ready?</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: I'm ready.</p><blockquote><p><em>ALISON DAVIS (to 911): My husband just fell down the stairs and there's blood everywhere, and I can't flip him over. I don't know if he's alive or dead. </em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: Listen to her.</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: And I can't believe they did this to her. It's unbelievable. Such injustice!</p><p>At the East Haven Tavern, the regulars were torn.</p>
<p><strong>Jodi Espy</strong>: A lot of people think she's guilty. A lot of people think she's innocent.</p><p><strong>Jessica Eakright</strong>: There's just not a bone in my body that thinks she could have done this.</p><p><strong>Jodi Espy</strong>: I believe that she's not guilty.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: What do you believe happened that night?</p><p><strong>Todd Spessert</strong>: I have no idea.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: In your mind, is Alison Davis a killer?</p><p><strong>Todd Spessert</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p>May 5, 2025. Alison has been locked up for 17 months.</p><p><strong>Jessica Eakright</strong>: The, um, trial starts tomorrow.</p><p>On the morning of May 6,  former Det.James Krueger — now Police Chief Krueger after a promotion — heads to court. </p><p><strong>Chief James Krueger </strong>(driving to court): I'm anxious. … What's at stake today is either Kevin Davis gets justice for what was done to him, or we let a — a murderer walk free.</p><p><strong>Max Wiley</strong>: I just, you know, kept thinking … what evidence do they have to say that Alison murdered him and there just … wasn't anything.</p><p>Krueger admits the investigation was flawed, but he isn't making any excuses.</p><p><strong>James Krueger</strong>: So, I was responsible for gathering the evidence, making sure everything was completed … if something got messed up or if I missed something, that — that falls on my responsibility … That's my baby.</p>
<p>He knows there are challenges — starting with a most basic issue.</p><p><strong>Chief James Krueger</strong>: He was a big guy. You know, the jurors may have a hard time believing that she was even capable of causing this injury to him.</p><p>And if the chief was a betting man?</p><p><strong>Chief James Krueger</strong>: I give this one a 50-50 … I believe there's a very good possibility that this jury will hang and there won't be a verdict.</p><p>At the Allen County Courthouse, both sides are set to go.</p><p><strong>Andrew Baldwin</strong>: The prosecution has no murder weapon.<strong> … </strong>The prosecution has nowhere to hide from the paltry evidence that it's about to present to you.</p><p><strong>Tesa Helge</strong>: There's no doubt that Kevin was murdered.</p>
<p>And like Krueger, Helge knows this case is a tough one. So many people think Alison Davis simply could not be a killer.</p><p><strong>Deontae Bristol</strong>: That's not Alison. That's not who she is. … She had no reason … Kevin was her world.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Are you convinced that Alison Davis murdered her husband?</p><p><strong>Chief James Krueger</strong>:  I'm 100 percent convinced. Yes.</p><h2>A DRAMATIC VERDICT</h2><p>Inside Fort Wayne's historic courthouse, no cameras are allowed. "48 Hours" is allowed a sketch artist. Investigators, doctors and loved ones testify. But all eyes are on Alison.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: And what do you see on her face?</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: I see love.</p>
<p>But it isn't love, it's forensics that define this trial. Doctors Smock and Dragovic, and their radically opposing theories.</p><p><strong>Dr. Bill Smock</strong>: Mr. Davis sustained blows to the head … not just on one side, but on the back and on the left side as well.</p><p>At trial, Smock presents a CT scan highlighting Kevin's injuries, the multiple fractures to his head.</p><p><strong>Dr. Bill Smock</strong>: What that says is that Mr. Davis sustained multiple blows to multiple areas of his head.</p><p><strong>Dr. Bill Smock</strong>: I told the jury that Mr. Davis was the victim of a homicide … He did not fall down those stairs.</p><p>He believes Alison wielded a weapon that was never found.</p><p><strong>Dr. Bill Smock</strong>: For example, a kettle bell, a weight … It certainly could be the end of a baseball bat.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L.J. Dragovic</strong>: Kevin Davis was not killed as a result of impacts by baseball bat.</p><p><strong>Dr. L.J. Dragovic</strong>: He suffered only one — one impact to the head as his head slammed into that — that post of the banister.</p><p>That one impact, Dragovic says, led to multiple fractures.He says the same impact then caused Kevin's brain to ricochet inside his skull.</p><p>The shattered bone fragments acted like shrapnel, tearing Kevin's brain.</p><p><strong>Dr. L.J. Dragovic</strong>: They claim that Kevin was beaten. … they got it wrong.</p><p><strong>Dr. Bill Smock</strong>: I would say Dr. Dragovic got it wrong.</p><p>Doctor Smock says just look at the police bodycam video. The banister post appears clean. There's no evidence Kevin's head struck it. </p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bill Smock</strong>: There was no blood, no tissue, no hair on the top of that banister.</p>
<p>But remember, Dragovic argues the post is clean because Kevin's injuries were internal.</p><p><strong>Dr. L.J. Dragovic</strong>: Kevin never had any open wound anywhere on his body.</p><p>Blood that was found by first responders was on the floor, beneath Kevin's body. It came from his nose and mouth.</p><p><strong>Chief James Krueger</strong> (at staircase banister): According to the defense, his skull hit this.</p><p>Chief Krueger tells "48 Hours" what he believes happened to Kevin.</p><p><strong>Chief. James Krueger</strong>: I believe that he made some comments to Alison who was laying down here on the couch.</p><p> <strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: And he's walking away from her?</p>
<p><strong>Chief James Krueger</strong>: … he's walking away from her … and Alison grabs an object … he takes that blow to the back of the head.</p><p>Legally intoxicated and immobilized by more blows –</p><p><strong>Chief James Krueger</strong>: … and somewhere in this area is where he loses it and falls.</p><p>Investigators believe Alison dragged 219-pound Kevin across a portion of the floor.</p><p><strong>Chief James Krueger</strong>: Mrs. Davis sees these stairs and says, well this is my scapegoat. I can make it look like this is an accident.</p><p><strong>Chief James Krueger</strong>: And he was pulled just enough to make it look like he fell down the stairs.</p><p>And Krueger says there's more evidence of Alison's guilt: Kevin's cold body temperature.</p>
<p><strong>Chief James Krueger</strong>: Core body temperature was 91 degrees. </p><p>Doctor Smock says he knows why.</p><p>DR. BILL SMOCK: Kevin Davis was lying there for at least two hours before 911 was called.</p><p>But in his testimony, Dragovic counters Kevin's low temperature is due to something else: the impact with the post destroyed a key part of Kevin's brain called the hypothalamus. </p><p><strong>Dr. L.J. Dragovic</strong>: … that part of the brain is the actual thermostat for the body.</p><p>The result:</p><p><strong>Dr. L.J. Dragovic</strong>: Your body temperature is out of control. … It's, uh, kaput.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bill Smock</strong>: There are so many inconsistencies with that theory.</p>
<p>Krueger took "48 Hours" upstairs to that bedroom Willow the pit bull mix shared with Kevin and Alison. Alison had warned Krueger, Willow might attack.</p><blockquote><p>ALISON DAVIS (bodycam video): She's up in the bedroom, and she's a guard dog.</p><p>DET. JAMES KRUEGER: Right now, what I won't do is I won't go in that room.</p><p>ALISON DAVIS: OK.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>:  Did you ever get into this room?</p><p><strong>Chief James Krueger</strong>: I never did. Not on that morning. … I 100 percent wish I would've gotten into this room on the morning of the 12th.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: Because?</p><p><strong>Chief James Krueger</strong>: The murder weapon could have been in there.</p><p>Chief Krueger has been at the house several times. This is the first time Alison's lawyers were able to get inside. </p>
<p><strong>Andrew Baldwin</strong>: Wow. </p><p><strong>Max Wiley</strong>: Oh my goodness. </p><p><strong>Andrew Baldwin</strong>: That's the staircase right there. … And there's the post … So, you hit that and you —you end up, yeah your feet over here.</p><p><strong>Max Wiley</strong>: Let's see how steep these stairs are, they are really steep. Aren't they? </p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: And narrow.</p><p><strong>Max Wiley:</strong> Yeah. And narrow. </p><p><strong>Andrew Baldwin</strong>: It's powerful to be in this house.</p>
<p>And to picture what they believe were the final, fatal steps of Kevin Davis.</p><p><strong>Andrew Baldwin</strong>: … it's an intoxicated guy that fell down the stairs and hit his head on that post right there …</p><p>The trial lasts four days. Alison does not take the stand.</p><blockquote><p>MARCUS TRUSCIO | WANE Reporter: The jury is now out … they just heard closing arguments for about two hours.</p></blockquote><p>Which story will the jury believe?</p><p>The courthouse is dark except for the jury room. Some 21 grueling months have passed since the heartbreaking death of Kevin Davis. If convicted of his murder, Alison Davis could spend the rest of her life in prison. At 11 p.m., word comes of a verdict. Alison's family and attorneys emerge. </p><p><strong>Max Wiley</strong>: Not guilty.</p><p><strong>Meghan Hodge</strong> | <strong>Family member</strong>:  Oh my God she's coming home! Oh my God! Oh!</p>
<p>Alison Davis is found not guilty.</p><p>Just moments before, Steve had locked eyes with his daughter as her verdict came down.</p><p><strong>Steve Krause </strong>(outside courthouse): She was crying with joy, and it was a wonderful moment.</p><p><strong>Andrew Baldwin </strong>(outside courthouse): That family over there — that's why we do this work. That's exactly why we do this work.</p><p>Kevin's mother Alta doesn't want Kevin to be forgotten.</p><p><strong>Alta Beers</strong>: He's my son. I've always loved him and always will.</p><p>She accepts the verdict.</p>
<p><strong>Alta Beers:</strong> I'm OK. I'm dealing with it. She's still my daughter-in-law, no matter what.</p><p>But where is Alison? Back in jail — waiting for her release paperwork. A cold but joyous crowd stands vigil. Then, at 2:12 a.m., the jailhouse door cracks open.</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: Alison comes out and everybody just erupts with joy.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: It was the group hug of the ages.</p><p><strong>Steve Krause</strong>: Yes … tears and saying Alison we missed you so much. It's so good to have you in our arms again.</p><p><strong>Alison Davis</strong>: It's a lot of emotions, really. </p><p>There is no joy for those who believe the jury got it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Chief James Krueger</strong>: I was like ugh, unbelievable, unbelievable.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: You were stunned by that?</p><p><strong>Chief James Krueger</strong>: I was, yeah.</p><p>"48 Hours" spoke with a juror who asked us not to show her face or use her name.</p><p><strong>Juror</strong>: Well the prosecution didn't have a strong case, like there was no weapon, there was no this is where she did it, and how she did it.</p><p><strong>Juror</strong>: The — the prosecution's theory had a lot of holes.</p><p>And the jury believed the theories of Dr. Dragovic.</p>
<p><strong>Juror</strong>: He explained everything in very clear terms that we could understand, and it just made sense. It made sense to the injuries.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: And for Kevin's family, what would you have to say them?</p><p><strong>Jodi Espy</strong>: Just that I'm so sorry for your loss. It's — it's so devastating.</p><p><strong>Peter Van Sant</strong>: What do you hope for her?</p><p><strong>Jessica Eakright:</strong> I hope that she can … find her place … to get back to that smiling happy person that she was.</p><p><strong>Jessica Eakright</strong>:  She didn't deserve a year and a half of her life taken away sitting in jail. … So, I was really happy for her. </p><p><em>Alison Davis has left New Haven and is living with her parents and her dog Willow.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Luigi Mangione's lawyers seek dismissal of federal charges</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Luigi Mangione's lawyers asked a New York judge to dismiss some criminal charges, including the only count for which he could face the death penalty, from a federal indictment brought against him in the December assassination of <span class="link">UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson</span>.</p><p>In papers filed Saturday in Manhattan federal court, the lawyers said <span class="link">prosecutors</span> should also be prevented from using at trial his statements to law enforcement officers and his backpack, in which a gun and ammunition were found.</p><p>They said Mangione was not read his rights before he was questioned by law enforcement officers, who arrested him after Thompson was fatally shot as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024.</p><p>They added that officers did not obtain a warrant before searching Mangione's backpack.</p><h2>Mangione's lawyers want death penalty off the table</h2><p>Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges in the fatal shooting.</p>
<p>The killing set off a multi-state search after the suspected shooter slipped away from the scene and rode a bike to Central Park, before taking a taxi to a bus depot that offers service to several nearby states.</p><p>Five days later, a tip from a McDonald's about 233 miles away in Altoona, Pennsylvania, led police to arrest Mangione. He has been held without bail since.</p><p>In September, lawyers for Mangione asked that his federal charges be dismissed and the death penalty be <span class="link">taken off the table</span> as a result of public comments by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. In April, Bondi directed prosecutors in New York to seek the death penalty, calling the killing of Thompson a "premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America."</p>
<p>Last month, a Manhattan Criminal Court judge <span class="link">dismissed</span> Mangione's state terrorism charges after his lawyers argued the parallel cases amounted to double jeopardy.   </p>
<p>Murder cases are usually tried in state courts, but prosecutors have also charged Mangione under a federal law on murders committed with firearms as part of other "crimes of violence." It's the only charge for which Mangione could face the death penalty, since it's not used in New York state.</p><p>The papers filed early Saturday morning argued that this charge should be dismissed because prosecutors have failed to identify the other offenses that would be required to convict him, saying that the alleged other crime -- stalking -- is not a crime of violence.</p><p>The assassination and its aftermath has captured the American imagination, setting off a cascade of resentment and online vitriol toward U.S. health insurers while rattling corporate executives concerned about security.</p><p>After the killing, investigators found the words "delay," "deny" and "depose," written in permanent marker on ammunition at the scene. The words mimic a phrase used by insurance industry critics.</p>

<div class="article-title">Biden undergoing radiation therapy, spokesperson says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Former President Joe Biden is undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment as part of a treatment plan for prostate cancer, a spokesperson told CBS News. </p><p>A person close to Biden tells CBS News the former president is doing well and responding to treatment. Another person familiar with Biden's treatment said it began "a few weeks ago and it continues." He is being treated in Philadelphia. </p><p>Biden was <span class="link">diagnosed with an "aggressive form"</span> of prostate cancer in May 2025. According to a statement from his office at the time, the former president was diagnosed with "prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone" after a small nodule was found in the prostate.</p><p>Gleason scores are a grading system, and the lower the grade, the more cancer cells look like normal cells. A score of 9 is the second-highest, <span class="link">CBS News previously reported</span>, and places Biden in the most aggressive risk category. </p><p>Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer that affects men, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Age is the most common risk factor. The condition has many forms of treatment, including radiation, chemotherapy, surgery and hormone treatment. </p>
<p>The former president was also <span class="link">treated for skin cancer two years ago</span>. At the time, he was in office. The White House physician said Biden had a small skin lesion with cancerous tissue removed from his chest during his annual physical. Further testing confirmed it was <span class="link">basal cell carcinoma</span>, the most common form of skin cancer.</p><p>Biden <span class="link">underwent a skin cancer surgery</span> in September 2025. That procedure was a Mohs surgery, which involves cutting away thin layers of skin until only cancer-free tissue remains in the affected area. </p><p>NBC News was the first to report.</p>

<div class="article-title">No survivors after blast at Tennessee military explosives plant, sheriff says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A powerful explosion that ripped through a military explosives facility in Tennessee left no survivors, officials said.</p><p>Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis confirmed 16 victims in the blast at a news conference on Saturday night, saying he has contacted all their family members after authorities discovered two of the initially missing people were found alive and not on site at the time of the incident.</p><p>"We've recovered no survivors," Davis said.</p><p>Davis also said he did not yet have details on the identities of the victims as of Saturday night. The sheriff said earlier in the day that teams will enter to start conducting a rapid DNA search to identify the victims. There were no updates regarding injuries.</p><p>The explosion took place at Accurate Energetic Systems, a military explosives plant, around 7:45 a.m. Central time on Friday morning, according to Davis. The blast occurred in one of the eight buildings on the campus. Video from the scene showed damaged vehicles and charred debris scattered around the area.</p>
<p>Earlier officials said 19 people were missing, but revised the number on Saturday, saying a person who was initially believed to be on site was located safely at home. Another person was also later found to not have been there at the time of the explosion, Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said.</p><p>CBS affiliate WTVF-TV in Nashville broadcast video of debris strewn about the site, with damaged vehicles in a parking lot.   </p>
<p>"I'm not gonna lie to you," Davis said. "This is probably one of the most devastating scenes that I've ever seen in my career."</p><p>When asked to describe the affected building, Davis said: "There's nothing to describe. It's gone." </p>
<p>The Associated Press reported that the blast rattled homes miles away. Gentry Stover, a nearby resident, told AP that it woke him up.</p><p>"I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it," he said in a phone interview. "I live very close to Accurate and I realized about 30 seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that."</p><h2>What caused the explosion in Tennessee?</h2><p>The cause of the explosion was not yet known, and the investigation could take days, the sheriff said.</p><p>Agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on site, Davis said. The Metro Nashville Police Department Bomb Squad also said it was responding to help process the scene. Davis said he expected crews to remain on the site for several days.</p><p>Sources close to the investigation told CBS News on Saturday morning that investigators are back assessing the site of the blast. The area "appears to be much more unstable than they thought," which is slowing down the process, and there are some small fires still smoldering around the building, sources said. </p><p>Davis warned there could be continued small explosions at the site. Hickman County Advanced EMT David Stewart told The Associated Press that emergency crews initially couldn't enter the plant because of continuing detonations. Sources said several small "controlled" explosions will likely occur throughout the day. </p><p>Agencies are using multiple methods to find and identify missing people; the FBI is using cell phone analysis to determine if the cell phone of someone who was reported missing was at or near the building at the time of the blast, while the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation will use rapid DNA testing to identify any victims that are found. </p>
<h2>What is Accurate Energetic Systems?</h2><p>Accurate Energetic Systems specializes in the development, manufacture, handling and storage of products and explosives for military, aerospace and commercial demolition markets, according to their website. The company also tests those explosives on the 1,300-acre campus. </p>
<p>AES has been awarded numerous military contracts primarily from the U.S. Army and Navy, according to public records reviewed by The Associated Press, and produced items including bulk explosives, small breaching charges and landmines. Officials at the Pentagon told AP they were aware of the explosion and were looking into the situation.</p><p>AES was cited and fined $7,200 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in 2019, online records show. There were three violations recorded. One violation described as being related to sanitation is listed as "serious." The other two violations are categorized as "other." </p><p>The company is cooperating with law enforcement in relation to the explosion, Davis said.  </p><p>The facility is on the border of Hickman and Humphreys counties, about 60 miles southwest of Nashville.</p><p>The state's emergency operations center in Nashville has been activated to Level 4—Elevated to support local requests, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said. People can call a missing persons hotline at 1-800-TBI-FIND/1-800-824-3463.</p>

<div class="article-title">Diane Keaton, star of "Annie Hall" and "Father of the Bride," dies at 79</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><span class="link">Diane Keaton</span>, the quirky actress known for her roles in "Annie Hall," "The Godfather," and the "Father of the Bride" films, has died at 79, Dori Rath, a producer and friend of Keaton, confirmed to CBS News in a phone call on Saturday.</p><p>Additional information was not immediately available. Keaton's family, which has not responded to CBS News' inquiries, has not released a statement, and is not planning to today, according to Rath.</p><p>People Magazine, which first reported Keaton's death, said the actress died in California on Saturday, Oct. 11, citing a family spokesperson.</p><p>An actress for more than four decades, the beloved star thought she would be a singer, telling "CBS Sunday Morning" in February 2010, "I wanted to sing. I did everything I could to be a singer."</p><p>Born in 1946 in Los Angeles, Keaton appeared on the stage in the musical "Hair" at 22 years old and then in Woody Allen's "Play It Again, Sam" in 1968, for which she would receive a Tony nomination.</p>
<p>Keaton said her voice wasn't good enough, and she moved on to acting, making her first film appearance in "Lovers and Other Strangers" in 1970, while her many early TV credits include appearances on "Mannix," "The F.B.I.," "Night Gallery," and "Love, American Style."</p>
<p>She starred as Al Pacino's girlfriend Kay in "The Godfather" in 1972 and repeated the role in the crime saga's two sequels. The couple became romantically involved after the filming of The Godfather Part II, Keaton said.</p><p>Keaton then became well-known for a string of movies she did with famed director Woody Allen — starting one of the 70s most enduring screen partnerships. She starred in "Manhattan," "Annie Hall," and "Love and Death, among others. </p><p>She said she had a "huge crush" on Allen right from the moment she saw him.</p>
<p>"He was hilarious," Keaton told "CBS News Sunday Morning."</p><p> She was also romantically linked to Warren Beatty, who directed her and with whom she co-starred in "Reds." </p>
<p>Keaton won her first Oscar for "Annie Hall" — an exceptionally rare win for a comic performance — at the 50th Annual Academy Awards and would go on to be nominated three more times, for "Reds," "Marvin's Room," and "Something's Gotta Give."</p><p>Keaton never married and didn't start a family until she was 50, saying she was "a late developer."  Keaton said if she got married, she would've had to "compromise too much." </p><p>She said she wanted to try more adventurous things for herself and also said she was "afraid of men." She said she was always being turned down and overlooked. "I wasn't marriage material."</p>
<p>She adopted two children when she was in her 50s: a daughter, Dexter, and a son, Duke.  Keaton said she really enjoyed being a daughter and didn't embrace parenthood until after her father died. </p><p>"I had to accept I had to move on," she said. </p>
<p>She continued to act throughout her life, her last appearance coming in 2024's "Summer Camp."</p><h2>Hollywood stars pay tribute to Diane Keaton</h2><p>Tributes to Keaton poured in from fellow Hollywood actors after they learned of her passing.</p><p>In a post on social media, Bette Midler said, "I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me."</p><p>"[Keaton] was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star," Midler, who starred alongside Keaton in "The First Wives Club," wrote on Instagram. "What you saw was who she was...oh, la, lala!"</p><p>Kimberly Williams-Paisley, who played Keaton's daughter in "Father of the Bride," said working with the legendary actress will always be one of the highlights of her life.</p><p>"You are one of a kind, and it was thrilling to be in your orbit for a time. Thank you for your kindness, your generosity, your talent, and above all, your laughter," she wrote.</p><p>In a short tribute posted to X, actor and comedian Ben Stiller said Keaton was "one of the greatest film actors ever."</p>
<p>"An icon of style, humor and comedy. Brilliant. What a person," Still wrote.</p><p>Nancy Sinatra, actor, singer and the daughter of Frank Sinatra, said she adored and idolized Keaton.</p><p>"She was a very special person and an incredibly gifted actor, who made each of her roles unforgettable. Her light will continue to shine through the art she leaves behind," she said. "Godspeed, Diane. My heart goes out to her family and to each of us grieving this heartbreaking loss."</p><p>Mandy Moore, who acted as Keaton's daughter in the film "Because I Said So", said it was an honor of a lifetime to get to call her "mom" for a few months.</p><p>"What an incandescent human Di is and was," Moore wrote on Instagram, sharing an image of the two together from the 2007 film. "I am so sad she's gone for all the reasons but also because it felt like she'd be here forever, dazzling us with her talent and charm (and her style, c'mon)!!! One of the very best to ever do it. All my love to her children and loved ones."</p>

<div class="article-title">16 people died in a blast at a Tennessee explosives factory early Friday, sheriff says</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>McEWEN, Tenn.  — A blast in rural Tennessee that leveled an explosives plant and was felt for miles around killed 16 people and left no survivors, authorities said.</p> <p>The explosion left a smoldering wreck of twisted and charred metal and burned-out vehicles at the Accurate Energetic Systems plant, which supplies and researches explosives for the military.</p> <p>The cause of the blast is not known. Investigators are combing the incinerated property foot-by-foot searching for possible evidence.</p> <p>"There's a gauntlet of emotions there," Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said during a news conference, pausing to clear his throat before he asked for prayers for the families of the victims in a shaky voice.</p>
<p>"We've recovered no survivors," he added.</p> <p>During a vigil at Hurricane Chapel in McEwen, senior pastor Tim Farris noted that many in attendance know each other, the victims and their families.</p> <p>"There's a lot of people hurting. A lot of people who are crying a lot of tears," he said. "We are sad that our community is going through this, but it's a tremendous opportunity for the church to minister to a lot of those people today."</p> <p>Farris said he spoke with some families of victims on Friday who were in shock and numb, and they did not show much emotion. That had changed by Saturday, he said.</p> <p>"Speaking with some of the families today, they were very emotional," Farris said. "They can hardly speak or anything, they are so emotional. I think as this goes on, it's going to hit more people. The depth of this, the reality of it. That's when they're going to need people the most."</p>
<p>Pamela Jane Brown was among those who came out to pray for friends missing in the blast and their families. She said an acquaintance of her family was driving by the plant when it exploded, and he was "hurt pretty good ... all cut up and bruised," but is now recovering at home.</p>
<p>"I was heartbroken," she said, after learning of the explosion on social media. Meeting others for prayer "was a coming together of the community – a good feeling."</p> <p>State officials brought in a "rapid DNA" team to help identify the remains of people recovered at the site.</p> <p>Davis said about 300 responders are working in a "slow, methodical method" as they deal with explosive material that has been damaged and remains volatile. An ambulance and a helicopter used for air evacuations were brought in, for the safety of first responders.</p> <p>"It's not like working an accident. It's not like working a tornado. We're dealing with explosions. And I would say at this time, we're dealing with remains," he said.</p> <p>Guy McCormick, a supervisory special agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said explosive specialists and bomb technicians are trying to make the area safe for national ATF investigators. He said the nature of the scene can change because of the heat and pressure caused by the explosion.</p> <p>Davis said it could be days, weeks or even months before foul play is ruled out.</p> <p>The site is located in a heavily wooded area of middle Tennessee, between the economically vital Tennessee River to the west and the bustling metropolis of Nashville to the east. Modest homes dot the wooded landscape, residences belonging to "good old country people," as local man Terry Bagsby put it.</p> <h3 class="edTag">'A lot of grief'</h3> <p>Bagsby, 68, is retired but he helps out working the register at a gas station near the site. He said people in the close-knit community are "very, very sad."</p> <p>He said he knows people who worked at the site.</p> <p>"I don't know how to explain it. … Just a lot of grief."</p>
<p>Officials at an evening news conference said counselors would be available for grieving students on Monday.</p>
<p>Earlier Saturday afternoon at the church in McEwen, about 30 people gathered to pray for victims of the explosion and their families. Music played and mourners bowed their heads and closed their eyes. Some knelt at an altar, placing their hands on each others' backs and shoulders. Some wept softly, among the whispered prayers.</p> <p>After the vigil, Farris, the pastor, told media that the area has seen its share of tragedy and loss of life, including a deadly flood a few years ago. He asked for prayers for first responders.</p> <p>"This is tiresome physically. This kind of thing weighs on you mentally. They carry that home. They need prayer and encouragement as well," he said.</p> <p>The company's website says it processes explosives and ammunition at an eight-building facility that sprawls across wooded hills in the Bucksnort area, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) southwest of Nashville. It is not immediately known how many people work at the plant or how many were there when the explosion happened.</p> <p>Accurate Energetic Systems, based in nearby McEwen, said in a post on social media on Friday that the company's "thoughts and prayers" are with the families and community impacted.</p> <p>"We extend our gratitude to all first responders who continue to work tirelessly under difficult conditions," the post said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Explosion jolts residents from sleep</h3> <p>The company has been awarded numerous military contracts, largely by the U.S. Army and Navy, to supply different types of munitions and explosives, according to public records. The products range from bulk explosives to landmines and small breaching charges, including C4.</p> <p>When the explosion occurred, residents in Lobelville, a 20-minute drive from the scene, said they felt their homes shake, and some people captured the loud boom of the explosion on their home cameras.</p> <p>The blast rattled Gentry Stover from his sleep.</p> <p>"I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it," he told The Associated Press. "I live very close to Accurate, and I realized about 30 seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that."</p>
<p>Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee posted on the social platform X that he is monitoring the situation and asked "Tennesseans to join us in prayer for the families impacted by this tragic incident."</p> <p>A small group gathered for a vigil Friday night at a nearby park, clutching candles as they prayed for the missing and their families and sang "Amazing Grace."</p> <p>The U.S. has a long history of deadly accidents at workplaces, including the Monongah coal mine explosion that killed 362 men and boys in West Virginia in 1907. Several high-profile industrial accidents in the 1960s helped lead President Richard Nixon to sign a law creating the Occupational Safety and Health Administration the next year.</p> <p>In 2019, Accurate Energetic Systems faced several small fines from the U.S. Department of Labor for violations of policies meant to protect workers from exposure to hazardous chemicals, radiation and other irritants, according to citations from OSHA.</p> <p>In 2014, an explosion occurred at another ammunition facility in the same small community, killing one person and injuring at least three others.</p>

<div class="article-title">Diane Keaton, Oscar-winning star of 'Annie Hall' and 'The Godfather,' dies at 79</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Diane Keaton, the Oscar-winning star of "Annie Hall," "The Godfather" films and "Father of the Bride," whose quirky, vibrant manner and depth made her one of the most singular actors of a generation, has died. She was 79.</p> <p>Her death was confirmed to NPR by Dori Rath, a producer of Keaton's films. No other details were immediately available.</p> <p>The unexpected news was met with shock around the world.</p> <p>"She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. What you saw was who she was…oh, la, lala!," Bette Midler said in a post on Instagram. She and Keaton co-starred in "The First Wives Club."</p>
<p>Keaton was the kind of actor who helped make films iconic and timeless, from her "La-dee-da, la-dee-da" phrasing as Annie Hall, bedecked in that necktie, bowler hat, vest and khakis, to her heartbreaking turn as Kay Adams, the woman unfortunate enough to join the Corleone family.</p> <p>Her star-making performances in the 1970s, many of which were in Woody Allen films, were not a flash in the pan either, and she would continue to charm new generations for decades thanks in part to a longstanding collaboration with filmmaker Nancy Meyers.</p> <p>She played a businessperson who unexpectedly inherits an infant in "Baby Boom," the mother of the bride in the beloved remake of "Father of the Bride," a newly single woman in "The First Wives Club," and a divorced playwright who gets involved with Jack Nicholson's music executive in "Something's Gotta Give."</p> <p>Keaton won her first Oscar for "Annie Hall" and would go on to be nominated three more times, for "Reds," playing the journalist and suffragist Louise Bryant, "Marvin's Room," as a caregiver who suddenly needs care herself, and "Something's Gotta Give," as a middle-aged divorcee who is the object of several men's affections.</p> <p>In her very Keaton way, upon accepting her Oscar in 1978 she laughed and said, "This is something."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">A child of Hollywood breaks through in New York</h3> <p>Keaton was born Diane Hall in January 1946 in Los Angeles, though her family was not part of the film industry she would find herself in. Her mother was a homemaker and photographer, and her father was in real estate and civil engineering, and both would inspire her love in the arts, from fashion to architecture.</p> <p>Keaton was drawn to theater and singing while in school in Santa Ana, California, and she dropped out of college after a year to make a go of it in Manhattan. Actors' Equity already had a Diane Hall in their ranks, and she took Keaton, her mother's maiden name, as her own.</p> <p>She studied under Sanford Meisner in New York and has credited him with giving her the freedom to "chart the complex terrain of human behavior within the safety of his guidance. It made playing with fire fun."</p> <p>"More than anything, Sanford Meisner helped me learn to appreciate the darker side of behavior," she wrote in her 2012 memoir, "Then Again." "I always had a knack for sensing it but not yet the courage to delve into such dangerous, illuminating territory."</p> <p>She started on the stage as an understudy in the Broadway production for "Hair," and in Allen' s "Play It Again, Sam" in 1968, for which she would receive a Tony nomination. And yet she remained deeply self-conscious about her appearance and battled bulimia in her 20s.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Becoming a star with "The Godfather" and Woody Allen</h3> <p>Keaton made her film debut in the 1970 romantic comedy "Lovers and Other Strangers," but her big breakthrough would come a few years later when she was cast in Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather," which won best picture and become one of the most beloved films of all time. And yet even she hesitated to return for the sequel, though after reading the script she decided otherwise.</p>
<p>She summed up her role as Kay, a role she never related to even though she savored memories of acting with Al Pacino.</p> <p>The 1970s were an incredibly fruitful time for Keaton thanks in part to her ongoing collaboration with Allen in both comedic and dramatic roles. She appeared in "Sleeper," "Love and Death," "Interiors," Manhattan," and the film version of "Play it Again, Sam." The 1977 crime-drama "Looking for Mr. Goodbar" also earned her raves.</p> <p>Allen and the late Marshall Brickman gave Keaton one of her most iconic roles in "Annie Hall," the infectious woman from Chippewa Falls whom Allen's Alvy Singer cannot get over. The film is considered one of the great romantic comedies of all time, with Keaton's eccentric, self-deprecating Annie at its heart.</p> <p>In <em>The New York Times</em>, critic Vincent Canby wrote, "As Annie Hall, Miss Keaton emerges as Woody Allen's Liv Ullman. His camera finds beauty and emotional resources that somehow escape the notice of other directors. Her Annie Hall is a marvelous nut."</p> <p>She acknowledged parallels between Annie Hall and real life, while also downplaying them.</p> <p>"My last name is Hall. Woody and I did share a significant romance, according to me, anyway," she wrote. "I did want to be a singer. I was insecure, and I did grope for words."</p> <p>Keaton and Allen were also in a romantic relationship, from about 1968, when she met him while auditioning for his play, until about 1974. Afterward they remained collaborators and friends. She later appeared in "Radio Days," in 1987, and "Manhattan Murder Mystery," in 1993.</p> <p>"He was so hip, with his thick glasses and cool suits," Keaton wrote in her memoir. "But it was his manner that got me, his way of gesturing, his hands, his coughing and looking down in a self-deprecating way while he told jokes."</p> <p>She was also romantically linked to Pacino, who played her husband in "The Godfather," and Warren Beatty who directed her and whom she co-starred with in "Reds." She never married but did adopt two children when she was in her 50s: a daughter, Dexter, and a son, Duke.</p>
<p>"I figured the only way to realize my number-one dream of becoming an actual Broadway musical comedy star was to remain an adoring daughter. Loving a man, a man, and becoming a wife, would have to be put aside," she wrote in the memoir.</p> <p>"The names changed, from Dave to Woody, then Warren, and finally Al. Could I have made a lasting commitment to them? Hard to say. Subconsciously I must have known it could never work, and because of this they'd never get in the way of achieving my dreams."</p> <h3 class="edTag">When Keaton met Nancy Meyers</h3> <p>Not all of Keaton's roles were home runs, like her foray into action in George Roy Hill's John le Carré adaptation of "Little Drummer Girl." But in 1987 she'd begin another long-standing collaboration with Nancy Meyers, which would result in four beloved films. Reviews for that first outing, "Baby Boom," directed by Charles Shyer, might have been mixed at the time but Pauline Kael even described Keaton's as a "glorious comedy performance that rides over many of the inanities."</p> <p>Their next team-up would be in the remake of "Father of the Bride," which Shyer directed and co-wrote with Meyers. She and Steve Martin played the flustered parents to the bride which would become a big hit and spawn a sequel.</p> <p>In 2003, Meyers would direct her in "Something's Gotta Give," a romantic comedy in which she begins a relationship with a playboy womanizer, played by Jack Nicholson, while also being pursued by a younger doctor, played by Keanu Reeves. Her character Erica Barry, with her beautiful Hamptons home and ivory outfits was a key inspiration for the recent costal grandmother fashion trend. It earned her what would be her last Oscar nomination and, later, she'd call it her favorite film.</p> <p>She also directed occasionally, with works including an episode of "Twin Peaks," a Belinda Carlisle music video and the sister dramedy "Hanging Up," which Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron co-wrote, and she starred in alongside Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow.</p>
<p>Keaton continued working steadily throughout the 2000s, with notable roles in "The Family Stone," as a dying matriarch reluctant to give her ring to her son, in "Morning Glory," as a morning news anchor, and the "Book Club" films.</p> <p>She wrote several books as well, including memoirs "Then Again" and "Let's Just Say It Wasn't Pretty," and an art and design book, "The House that Pinterest Built."</p> <p>Keaton was celebrated with an AFI Life Achievement Award in 2017, telling the AP at the time that it was a surreal experience.</p> <p>"I feel like it's the wedding I never had, or the big gathering I never had, or the retirement party I never had, or all these things that I always avoided — the big bash," she said. "It's really a big event for me and I'm really, deeply grateful."</p> <p>In 2022, she "cemented" her legacy with a hand and footprint ceremony outside the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, with her children looking on.</p> <p>"I don't think about my film legacy," she said at the event. "I'm just lucky to have been here at all in any way, shape or form. I'm just fortunate. I don't see myself anything other than that."</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump slashes mental health agency as shutdown drags on</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The Trump administration has laid off more than 100 employees at the nation's main mental health agency, NPR has learned.</p> <p>Current and former employees at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) told NPR about the layoffs, which were part of a government-wide reduction in force. The sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the agency, said the layoffs came late Friday, as the nation's government shutdown dragged on.</p> <p>Employees were notified of a "Reduction in Force" shortly before 8 p.m. ET on Friday, according to a source within the agency who was not authorized to discuss the layoffs publicly. According to the source, administration officials offered no rationale for who lost their jobs:</p>
<p>"I think the general feeling today is shock — and not understanding why?" the source told NPR.</p> <p>That source was aware of dozens of firings. Two former employees told NPR that the total number of employees at SAMHSA who lost their jobs was around 125, though that number was a rough estimate. SAMHSA had employed around 900 people at the start of this administration, but had already lost a third of that number to layoffs in the spring. With this latest round of firings, that number is down to nearly half. </p> <p>In a statement, the Department of Health and Human Services, which houses SAMHSA, confirmed the cuts. </p> <p>"HHS employees across multiple divisions are receiving reduction-in-force notices as a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown," Andrew Nixon, the department's director of communications, wrote to NPR in an email late Saturday.</p> <p>SAMHSA is responsible for overseeing the new 988 suicide prevention hotline. It also gives out billions in grants for mental health and addiction services. It was created in 1992 through bipartisan legislation signed by then-President George H.W. Bush. In 2024 its budget was about $7.5 billion, most of which went directly to states for programs aimed at mental health issues and addiction.</p>
<p>SAMHSA funds "are the backbone of behavioral health in this country," Rachel Winograd, a psychologist at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis, told NPR earlier this year. "If those grants were to go away, we'd be screwed."</p>
<p>Despite having what many see as an essential role in protecting the nation's mental health, SAMHSA has not been viewed favorably by the current administration. President Trump had proposed slashing its budget as part of his Big Beautiful Bill. And earlier this year, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told Congress that he intended to fold its duties into a new program he calls the Administration for a Healthy America.</p> <h3 class="edTag">CDC in confusion as some cuts reversed</h3>
<p>SAMHSA was not the only agency to see staff laid off on Friday evening. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also appears to have suffered cuts to staffing, according to two employees who say they were affected by the firings. Both employees were not authorized to speak to the press while the layoffs are being finalized.</p>
<p>But the cuts at CDC seemed to be in flux late Saturday. In an apparent reversal, one employee had their firing undone according to a letter seen by NPR. The letter, from Tom Nagy, the Chief Human Capital Officer at the department of Health and Human Services said the employee's Reduction in Force was "hereby revoked."</p> <p>The source said they were aware of other reversals at the CDC, but it was unclear how many employees received such letters.</p>
<p>Before the reversals went out, one CDC official who was laid off told NPR that the agency had been the subject of sweeping cuts to staff at offices responsible for disease surveillance, outbreak forecasting, chronic diseases, and immunization and respiratory diseases, to name but a few. "If you wanted to weaken America's public health capacity without saying it outright, this is how you'd do it — remove the people who connect the dots, steady the ship, and keep the public informed," the official who was laid off told NPR.</p> <p><em>The New York Times </em>also reported extensive cuts at the public health agency, including two senior officials responsible for overseeing the CDC's measles response team. </p> <p>The statement from HHS's Nixon did not directly address the CDC cuts or the apparent reversals, but it indicated more cuts could come.</p> <p>"HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda," it said.</p> <p><em>NPR's Pien Huang and Jeff Brady contributed to this report.</em></p>

<p>Venezuela opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado said in an interview with NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday that her country is in chaos and called for the removal of Venezuela's authoritarian President Nicolás Maduro.</p> <p>Speaking while still in hiding within Venezuela's borders, the far-right leader decried Maduro as an illegitimate strongman who had elbowed his way into a third term despite consistent evidence that his administration had rigged the vote.</p> <p>"I want to be very clear with this: Regime change was already mandated by the Venezuelan people on July 28, 2024," Machado said during an interview with NPR's Ayesha Rascoe on Saturday, citing last year's controversial, closely watched election.</p>
<p>"The narrative of the regime right now is that if Maduro goes, chaos will come to Venezuela. That's absolutely false," she said. "Venezuela is in profound, total chaos right now."</p> <p>Machado – whom Maduro's regime had barred from running in the race – had backed opposition candidate Edmundo González in the race to steer Venezuela as it suffers through a political and economic crisis that has forced more than one-fifth of its residents to flee the country.</p> <p>Machado has been one of the staunchest critics of the powerful United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) since it first came to power in the late 1990s. A former legislator in the Venezuelan National Assembly, Machado has been shot at, targeted by federal prosecutors, banned from running for office, and forced into hiding by the government of Maduro, who succeeded PSUV founder Hugo Chávez in 2013.</p> <p>"We won by a landslide in the presidential election, and we proved it with over 85% of the original tally sheets. The whole world knows that. Even Maduro's allies know that he was defeated," Machado said.</p> <p>Several Latin American countries, alongside the United States, agree that Maduro manipulated the electoral system in order to maintain his grip on Venezuela's government. The country has been riddled with corruption and, under Maduro's leadership, seen the country descend into economic collapse and a crackdown on free speech.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has accused Maduro of leading a drug cartel and has ordered deadly strikes on boats it says were carrying drugs. The U.S. State Department is offering a reward of up to $50 million for information that would lead to Maduro's arrest.</p> <p>Machado echoed those claims that Maduro is operating as a cartel head and blamed him for the boat strikes and broader international hostility towards Venezuela.</p> <p>"[The cartel] are destabilizing, intentionally, the region and undermining the institutions in the United States, because they have turned Venezuela into the safe haven of the enemies of the United States – Iran, China, Russia, Hezbollah, Hamas, and others," she said.</p> <p>"So, this is a war that was declared by Maduro, not us."</p> <p>When asked if she would support U.S. military invasion of Venezuela to see Maduro deposed, Machado declined to speculate on whether President Trump would authorize such actions, but she called Trump a valuable ally in recognizing the "threat" Maduro presents as a leader.</p> <p>"You cannot have peace without freedom, and you cannot have freedom without strength," Machado said.</p> <p>"When you are facing a criminal structure, they have used violence, all the resources of the Venezuelan people against innocent people. People that are in prison right now that are tortured, persecuted and killed," she said. "We need to stop this because it is a matter of saving lives and the regime has to understand that impunity is over."</p> <p>Machado had dedicated her Nobel Peace Prize to Trump, whom she has supported and called on directly to help steer Venezuela towards democracy.</p> <p>When asked whether she did so in the hopes that it would inspire Trump to help force Maduro out, Machado said: "I dedicated it to the people of Venezuela and President Trump because I think it's the correct thing to do."</p>
<p>"I think it is fair, not only for what he has been doing in the last months to solve long and painful conflicts around the world, but precisely for what he's doing right now for the Americas," she said, adding that, if and when Maduro is ousted, she hoped to see the fall of other repressive regimes in Cuba and Nicaragua as well.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>In a post on Truth Social, President Trump said he has "identified funds" to ensure the active military gets paid next week, as Congress stalls over negotiations to reopen the federal government.</p> <p>"I am using my authority, as Commander in Chief, to direct our Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to use all available funds to get our Troops PAID on October 15th. We have identified funds to do this, and Secretary Hegseth will use them to PAY OUR TROOPS," Trump said. </p> <p>Active-duty troops risked missing their first full paychecks on Wednesday, October 15.</p> <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reposted Trump's social media post on X stating, "President Trump delivers for the troops." </p>
<p>A White House official not authorized to speak publicly says that the Defense Department will be able to use research and development funding to pay service members. Those funds are available for two years, the official said but they did not provide further details on how much money is set aside.</p> <p>President Trump previously said he would ensure active military would be paid despite the shutdown. </p> <p>"We will get our service members every last penny," Trump said at a Navy event in Norfolk, Virginia, last weekend.

<div class="article-title">Smithsonian museums and National Zoo set to close as shutdown takes its toll</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>As the government shutdown drags on, Smithsonian museums, the National Zoo and other facilities are the latest to be caught in the fray, with the federal trust announcing the closure of all of its sites beginning on Sunday.</p> <p>"We will update our operating status as soon as the situation is resolved," the Smithsonian announced on social media. "We do not plan to update social media other than to inform you of changes to our operating status."</p> <p>The closure affects all of the Smithsonian's 21 museums, its research centers and the National Zoo.</p>
<p>As worried social media users expressed concern about the well-being of the animals at the zoo, the Smithsonian assured its supporters that the animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure.</p> <p>"All the animals at the Zoo and at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia, will continue to be fed and cared for," the Smithsonian said. "A shutdown will not affect our commitment to the safety of our staff and standard of excellence in animal care."</p> <p>The zoo's beloved animal cams, however, are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.</p> <p>The Smithsonian receives about 62% of its funding from the federal government, which helps support free admission to all of its D.C. museums and the National Zoo.</p> <p>Its facilities had been able to keep their doors open for the first 11 days of the shutdown by relying on prior-year funds, but those coffers have since run dry.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian is just the most recent entity to find itself ensnared in the ongoing dispute on government funding.</p> <p>Some national parks around the country have also been forced to close as staff have been deemed nonessential and sent home until Congress can reach an agreement on government funding.</p> <p>On Friday, thousands of federal employees across agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education began receiving reduction in force notices, informing them that they would be laid off.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The small town of Leland, Miss., was rocked Friday night by a mass shooting at a homecoming event that left four people dead and a dozen injured, according to the mayor.</p> <p>"An event like this has never happened in this city," Leland Mayor John Lee told NPR by phone. "We're a close knit city, we're not a violent city."</p> <p>Leland is a small town of roughly 3,700 people where "everybody knows everybody," Lee said. </p>
<p>The shooting took place in downtown Leland after the local high school's homecoming football game. The gathering takes place annually: "Families ... in town visiting get together and just have family and fun," Lee said.</p> <p>He said 16 people in total had been shot. Four were killed, and four more were transported to medical centers for treatment. </p> <p>The University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson confirmed that two patients connected with the shooting were airlifted overnight but it declined to give information on their condition, citing patient privacy.</p>
<p>Leland's police department declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation. Lee said that no suspect was in custody. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation said in a statement that it was helping to investigate the shooting.</p> <p>The Gun Violence Archive says that so far this year, the U.S. has seen more than 330 mass shootings — in which four or more people were shot.</p>

<div class="article-title">Africa's oldest leader isn't ready to retire — and he's not the only one defying age</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — After a newspaper reported in 1897 that the great American writer Mark Twain had died, a bemused -- but very much alive -- Twain famously quipped: "the report of my death was an exaggeration."</p> <p>This century, several aging African leaders have also had to reject premature reports of their deaths, like Cameroon's Paul Biya last year when rumours of his demise spread on social media after he wasn't seen in public for a month.</p> <p>It turned out the 92-year-old, who has the distinction of being the world's oldest, non-royal, leader, was simply in residence at his second home in Switzerland.</p>
<p>This Sunday he's seeking an eighth term in office –- having ruled Cameroon for 43 years -- that experts say he's all but guaranteed to win given that his strongest rival was barred from running. His country is beset with issues including jihadist violence, a separatist movement, and systemic corruption.</p>
<p>Biya is far from an isolated example in Africa, which despite being the continent with the world's youngest population, boasts numerous gerontocracies.</p> <p>"It is an irony for a continent whose median age is just 19," says Africa analyst Paul Nantulya. He says "third-termism" as he dubs some African leaders' attempts to cling to power, "is a disease."</p> <p>NPR looks at some more of Africa's oldest leaders.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>Peter Mutharika, Malawi, 85</strong></h3> <p>Out with the old and in with the…older. That's how the small southern African democracy of Malawi voted last month when they elected their former president, 85-year-old Peter Mutharika, over incumbent Lazarus Chakwera, aged 70.</p> <p>Malawians were fed up with rising costs and severe fuel shortages.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Alassane Ouattara, Ivory Coast, 83</strong></h3> <p>Ouattara, a former economist for the International Monetary Fund, is running on October 25 for a fourth term. In 2020 he said he wouldn't run again, as the constitution prevented leaders from running for more than two terms. Despite that promise, Ouattara later changed the constitution to allow himself to run again, sparking violent protests.</p> <p>Ivory Coast, a former French colony and the world's top cocoa producer, is still recovering from a brutal civil war in the early 2000s.</p> <p>There have been protests again this month in the run-up to the polls, after two opposition leaders were barred from contesting the vote.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>Teodoro Obiang Nguema, Equatorial Guinea, 83</strong></h3> <p>After Cameroon's Biya, who beats him by only a few months, the longest-ruling leader in Africa is Obiang. At 83 he has also ruled his country for 43 years.</p> <p>The petrostate on Africa's West coast has only had two presidents since independence from Spain in the 1960s. The first was Obiang's own uncle, who he overthrew in a coup in 1979.</p>
<p>The country is effectively a one-party state and international observers have long said elections are flawed with Obiang usually taking 90-plus percent of the vote. In one voting district in 2002, he even won 103 percent of the ballot.</p> <p>Equatorial Guinea also has a shocking human rights record and dire state of press freedom. Despite the country's vast oil wealth, little has trickled down to ordinary citizens while Obiang is a fan of mansions, superyachts and luxury cars.</p> <p>The Trump administration recently approved a waiver of sanctions against Obiang to allow him to travel to New York for the UN General Assembly. He met with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and the two agreed to expand ties.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe, 83</strong></h3> <p>Born just a few months after Obiang, Mnangagwa became president of the Southern African nation after deposing his geriatric predecessor, Robert Mugabe, in a 2017 coup. At the time Mugabe was 93 and had the title of the world's oldest leader.</p> <p>Zimbabweans hoped Mnangagwa, 18 years Mugabe's junior, would allow free and fair elections, fix the country's broken economy and end corruption. Eight years later, many Zimbabweans say things are worse under the man they dub "the crocodile."</p> <h3 class="edTag">The rise of Gen Z</h3> <p>But there are increasing signs time might be up for Africa's aging leaders. Young Africans are fed up with the status quo, with so-called "Gen Z" protests erupting this year in countries like Kenya, Togo, Madagascar and Morocco.</p>
<p>And some young leaders are on the rise. Burkina Faso's 37-year-old interim president Ibrahim Traoré is one of the youngest in the world. Although he rose to power in a 2022 coup, he's incredibly popular with the nation's youth. Then in Uganda, elections next year will see popstar-turned-politician Bobi Wine, 43, take on longtime President Yoweri Museveni, 81 – who is seeking a seventh term in office.</p> <p>Of course, it's not only Africa that has officially aging leaders. Iran's supreme leader Seyyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei is 86, King Salman of Saudi Arabia is 89, and the last two US presidents, Joe Biden and Donald Trump are 82 and 79 respectively.<br/></p>

<p>From the slight smile on Yefreannys Isamar Muñoz López's face, it might be a surprise to learn that she is working on math equations with her dad. The photo was made after they had trekked hundreds of miles from Venezuela to the United States-Mexico border, awaiting their immigration appointment.</p> <p>Yefreannys is one of many girls whom Danielle Villasana has met as a photojournalist working around the world over the last decade, capturing images that show how girls and young women persist in spite of the issues and inequalities they face.</p> <p>Villasana remembers: "She was just so happy, so full of joy, not complaining, not upset."</p>
<p>It's a picture that resonates on October 11 – the International Day of the Girl on the United Nations calendar of special days. Dedicating a day to girls, according to the U.N., serves as a "rallying cry to see girls for who they truly are, to listen to their voices and to recognize their limitless potential."</p> <p>We're featuring a selection of photos from Villasana's body of work over the years.</p> <p>Villasana says she is in awe of the strong spirit of the girls she's encountered. "I've met girls and women who have been kidnapped by militants or faced gender-based violence when migrating, who have camped in vans going across hundreds of miles. It's just amazing that the women and girls can keep pushing forward despite these incredible, really unthinkable challenges."</p> <p>"I think when given opportunity and support and education and resources," she says, "women and girls are unstoppable." That's the message she hopes to send with her photographs.</p>

<div class="article-title">Luigi Mangione's lawyers seek a dismissal of federal charges in CEO killing</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>NEW YORK — Lawyers for Luigi Mangione asked a New York federal judge Saturday to dismiss some criminal charges, including the only count for which he could face the death penalty, from a federal indictment brought against him in the December assassination of UnitedHealthcare's chief executive.</p> <p>In papers filed in Manhattan federal court, the lawyers said prosecutors should also be prevented from using at trial his statements to law enforcement officers and his backpack where a gun and ammunition were found.</p> <p>They said Mangione was not read his rights before he was questioned by law enforcement officers, who arrested him after Brian Thompson was fatally shot as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference.</p>
<p>They added that officers did not obtain a warrant before searching Mangione's backpack.</p> <p>Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges in the fatal shooting of Brian Thompson on Dec. 4 as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel for his company's annual investor conference.</p> <p>The killing set off a multi-state search after the suspected shooter slipped away from the scene and rode a bike to Central Park, before taking a taxi to a bus depot that offers service to several nearby states.</p> <p>Five days later, a tip from a McDonald's about 233 miles (375 kilometers) away in Altoona, Pennsylvania, led police to arrest Mangione. He has been held without bail since then.</p> <p>Last month, lawyers for Mangione asked that his federal charges be dismissed and the death penalty be taken off the table as a result of public comments by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. In April, Bondi directed prosecutors in New York to seek the death penalty, calling the killing of Thompson a "premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America."</p>
<p>Murder cases are usually tried in state courts, but prosecutors have also charged Mangione under a federal law on murders committed with firearms as part of other "crimes of violence." It's the only charge for which Mangione could face the death penalty, since it's not used in New York state.</p> <p>The papers filed early Saturday morning argued that this charge should be dismissed because prosecutors have failed to identify the other offenses that would be required to convict him, saying that the alleged other crime — stalking — is not a crime of violence.</p>
<p>The assassination and its aftermath has captured the American imagination, setting off a cascade of resentment and online vitriol toward U.S. health insurers while rattling corporate executives concerned about security.</p> <p>After the killing, investigators found the words "delay," "deny" and "depose," written in permanent marker on ammunition at the scene. The words mimic a phrase used by insurance industry critics.</p>
