<div class="article-title">Trump deserves huge credit for achieving peace in Gaza, but marred the moment with his campaign of retribution</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Trump issues plenty of threats.</p><p>Sometimes they get results, sometimes they don’t.</p><p>And sometimes it’s just bluster. Especially if it’s an online posting, such as saying that Chicago’s mayor and Illinois’ governor should go to jail for resisting him on dispatching troops to the Windy City.</p><p>But his relentless personality – backed by the world’s most powerful military – can be overpowering.</p><p>It’s hard to overstate what a remarkable achievement Trump is in the process of assembling by getting Israel and Hamas to end their brutal and bloody two-year-old war.</p><p>It’s fair to say no other president could have pulled this off. Joe Biden certainly couldn’t. In fact, not since Jimmy Carter staged the marathon Camp David talks with Anwar Sadar and Menachem Begin has a president brokered peace between the Israelis and one of their Arab enemies. </p><p>Trump himself engineered the Abraham Accords, with help from Jared Kushner, joined by the U.A.E. and Bahrain, in his first term, and later by Sudan and Morocco. That gave him the experience to tackle this immensely tougher challenge and spur more Nobel Peace Prize speculation.</p><p>Now some quick caveats are in order. The president says he expects the remaining 20 hostages to be returned Monday or Tuesday, but the Hamas terrorists could come up with new objections that derail the train.</p><p>Reporters were asking about Phase 2, which would include returning the bodies of deceased hostages, but the president wisely deflected those questions.  </p><p>So no popping of champagne corks quite yet.</p><p>Presumably, it was these reservations that prompted anchors and correspondents on the air to appear rather sober-faced as they covered the latest developments. But I think it was more than that.</p><p>Some of these journalists are not exactly supportive of Trump. And so it’s not easy for them to shower him with credit. They say the right words – tremendous accomplishment and so on – but the body language sends a different message.</p><p>Look, Israel has been in a state of war, or cold war, with the surrounding countries since its founding in 1948.</p><p>And in a broader sense, the Jews and the Arabs have had hostile relations for many centuries. It’s in the Bible, the plea to Pharaoh to "let my people go."</p><p>Now, there remain crucial unanswered questions about who will rule Gaza, most of it reduced to rubble, in the future. Israel was subject to a brutal massacre on Oct. 7, but it has also found itself increasingly isolated as more than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed. Many Israelis, and American Jews, believe Bibi Netanyahu let the war drag on too long to protect his political standing.</p><p>Trump had to pressure Bibi into accepting his peace deal, essentially by threatening to have the U.S. walk away.</p><p>Now Hamas is essentially being asked to surrender by turning in its weapons. Trump says he will join with other countries in a peace council to prevent the resumption of war. But those details remain murky, beyond the fact that the terrorists will no longer be in charge, as they have been since Israel voluntarily withdrew from the Gaza Strip nearly two decades ago.</p><p>So just as the president was basking in some well-deserved praise for essentially remaking the Middle East, there was a new development.</p><p>A grand jury indicted Letitia James, New York’s attorney general, for mortgage fraud.</p><p>This, in a nutshell, underscores the duality of the Trump presidency.</p><p>It seems like a petty move, and in a video, James said "we will fight these baseless charges aggressively."</p><p>As with the recent indictment of James Comey, the indictment was returned only because Trump replaced his own U.S. attorney in Virginia’s eastern district with White House aide and loyalist Lindsey Halligan, who has no prosecution experience.</p><p>Trump told his AG, Pam Bondi, in a memo that James, like Comey, was "guilty as hell." The Wall Street Journal says that "Pam" memo was intended to be secret.</p><p>Career prosecutors had decided there wasn’t enough evidence to charge James, who brought a civil suit against candidate Trump on real estate inflation that produced a fine which grew to half a billion dollars – so outrageous that an appellate court tossed it out. James also won her job by promising to go after Trump, calling him an "illegitimate" president.</p><p>James has owned a home in Brooklyn for decades, and two years ago she bought a house in Norfolk, Va. with her niece.</p><p>The career prosecutors found little evidence that James was dishonest in completing the paperwork.</p><p>The media spotlight immediately shifted from Trump the global peacemaker to Trump the crusader who is doggedly pursuing a campaign of retribution against his enemies.</p><p>At the very moment he was drawing praise from around the world, Trump stepped on his own story.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">American trucking industry urges lawmakers to act as online cargo theft surges</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>As the holiday season kicks off, freight trucking experts say cargo theft will once again surge as more products hit the road.</p><p>The July Q2 report from CargoNet, a national information-sharing system that tracks cargo theft, shows a 13% increase in cargo theft compared to the same time in 2024.</p><p>Old-fashioned cargo theft is still happening, and one San Antonio-based freight business has some experience with it. </p><p>"Before 2020 it was more just straight thefts," said Adam Blanchard, co-founder of Double Diamond Transport and Tanager Logistics. "They would come in, cut the seals and take cargo out of it."</p><p>Online cargo theft has skyrocketed since the pandemic, rising 1,500% over the past four years, according to Trucking.org.</p><p>Keith Lewis, CargoNet's Vice President of Operations, said he noticed the jump in online theft just after 2020, "and the bad guys realized they could work from anywhere in the world and control freight."</p><p>These fraudsters are now digging deep into all facets of the trucking industry.</p><p>"They stole my identity as a freight broker in order to get cargo from other companies and tender it to legitimate motor carriers and I started having legitimate trucking companies reaching out to me asking for payment for freight that wasn’t mine," Blanchard said.</p><p>Blanchard traced the fraudsters back to Eastern Europe and found they stole a load of energy drinks. His business partner got the fake logistics company on the phone, but they were never hit with legal action. </p><p>The heist by the fraudsters hurt Blanchard's reputation, and due to the rise in theft claims, his business insurance rates doubled this year.</p><p>American Trucking Associations (ATA) CEO Chris Spear told FOX, "This is much more tech-driven by transnational organizations operating out of Eastern Europe, Russia. They’re actually going into the bill of laden, they’re looking for the expensive type of freight."</p><p>But what happens once a truckload of product is stolen by a fraudster across the world?</p><p>"They’ll steal that freight, put it in containers as best we can tell, a lot of it is going to the LA area, and transport it to other countries," Blanchard said.</p><p>CargoNet's Lewis said sometimes freight companies do not know a load of goods is stolen until weeks, months or even a year later. </p><p>"The problem is, is we don’t have mandatory reporting, so a lot of these go unreported," he said. </p><p>So far this year, California, Texas, and Illinois rank in the top three for cargo theft, representing 53% of all cargo theft nationwide. The top items targeted are food and beverages, and household goods.</p><p>The ATA says cargo theft is a $19 million-a-day hit to the trucking industry.</p><p>The freight trucking industry is urging lawmakers to pass the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act (CORCA). The ATA said the bill "would provide law enforcement and industry with a unified framework to fight back. Not only would it create a long-overdue task force to pursue these criminal rings, but it would also establish a badly needed national cargo theft database."</p><p>Blanchard testified to Congress in February, along with other industry leaders. </p><p>"Here is the crux of the issue. There is no law enforcement agency that is focused on this," Blanchard said. "Until we get legislation passed on the federal level that establishes a federal law enforcement coalition that begins to investigate these crimes, and begins to actually conduct arrests and prosecutions, this [is] only going to continue to get worse." </p><p>Blanchard said theft will affect every part of the business, which means he may have to increase prices – ultimately leading to higher prices for shoppers.</p><p>"When they’re seeing products not arriving on the shelves, there’s a shortage of that," Spear said. "The cost goes up. There’s a reflection in what you, I and what everyone pays for the things we want and need." </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Eagles get blown out by Giants after running tush push play 4 straight times, inciting backlash</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart led his team to a stunning 34-17 victory of the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles on Thursday night.</p><p>Meanwhile, Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts threw his first interception of the season, and prompted controversy early in the game when his team ran four straight tush push plays.</p><p>The Eagles scored their first touchdown of the game on the sequence of repetitive "tush pushes" inside New York's 10-yard line. Referees also missed a false-start on the Eagles on one of those plays. </p><p>Prominent figures including Green Bay Packers star linebacker Micah Parsons and Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy criticized the Eagles for overusing the play on social media.</p><p>Dart overcame an injury scare in the third quarter when he had to leave the game and get checked out by the medical staff, as the Giants led by 10. But he returned on the very next drive, and then eventually led the Giants on a game-clinching touchdown drive to extend their lead to 17.</p><p>Giants rookie running back Cam Skattebo bulldozed his way into the end zone from 4 yards out and twice from the 1-yard line. Dart scampered in untouched on his 20-yard TD run and connected with Wan’Dale Robinson on a 35-yard catch-and-run to the end zone.</p><p>The rookies who each fumbled on Sunday in a turnover-heavy loss at New Orleans responded the way coach Brian Daboll expected. Dart finished 17 of 25 for 195 yards passing and 13 carries for 58 yards after getting a concussion test following a big hit, while Skattebo rushed 19 times for a career-high 98 yards.</p><p>This was just the Giants’ fourth victory in their past 18 games against the Eagles.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">First-time conservative event attendees discuss debate over 'owning the libs' at TPUSA campus tour</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Multiple students told Fox News Digital on Thursday that the latest Turning Point USA gathering was their first conservative event, another sign of the growing fervor on the right in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination last month.</p><p>The University of North Dakota was the latest stop on the conservative group's "This Is The Turning Point" campus tour. Fox News Digital spoke to attendees of the event about whether they had prior involvement in the conservative movement, and if conversations and debate needed to be prioritized over "owning" liberals.</p><p>During the TPUSA event that took place this week at Montana State University, Vivek Ramaswamy made comments regarding conversations that conservatives ought to aim for, and students were asked to respond. </p><p>"Own the libs" has been a popular slogan in conservative circles over the last decade, but Ramaswamy believes that mindset is a thing of the past. </p><p>"We don't care about owning the libs. Not anymore," Ramaswamy said.</p><p>Students were asked whether they believe the most effective way to win over Americans is through debate and conversation rather than confrontation.</p><p>"I don't think that the conversation should really be about owning anyone, or it shouldn't be like attacking, either side attacking each other. I think we should… try to have productive conversations to get towards our end goal," said Brandon. </p><p>Easton said, "I'd say each group has felt like they've owned the other one during times, but I wouldn't ever say that the conservatives have owned the liberals."</p><p>Abbie pointed to Kirk, who founded TPUSA in 2012, as an example of how conversations ought to be done. "I think that's what Charlie was the best at, that he wouldn't kind of try and one-up them. He would try to respect them and just say the facts on why their opinions were wrong, I guess."</p><p>Andrew said, "It's obvious after the death of Charlie Kirk that… there's factions in this country that don't want to solve issues with debates and constructive arguments."</p><p>Zach said, "They're [liberals] honestly kind of so crazy at this point, they're owning themselves."</p><p>"When you choose violence, you're already losing regardless… the best thing we can do is kind of honestly follow like Charlie Kirk's model. You know, just talk to them, no matter what they spit or shout at you," he added.</p><p>Easton didn't hold back.</p><p>"Obviously, they don't want gun violence, but that's kind of what they turn to when they feel like they've been wronged in a way. So I'd almost agree with that statement to an extent," he told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Several students discussed attending the event as a first for their involvement in the conservative movement.</p><p>"This is my first conservative event. I really just, I'm just going to check it out though," Brett said. </p><p><i>"</i>I didn't know much about Turning Point before the passing of Charlie Kirk," Jace said. "And so I kind of wanted to just see what it was about."</p><p>Andrew said, "I'm really just curious to see what their stance on Israel is."</p><p>Zach, Cooper, and Devin, almost in unison, shared that the event was their first official conservative gathering. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Los Angeles Dodgers topped the Philadelphia Phillies following an 11-inning thriller in Game 4 of the National League Division Series on Thursday night.</p><p>The Dodgers had the bases loaded with two outs in the bottom of the 11th with outfielder Andy Pages at the plate against Phillies reliever Orion Kerkering. Pages hit a bouncing grounder to Kerkering, who had a tough time fielding the ball. He needed to make a rushed throw to the catcher J.T. Realmuto, but he tossed it too high and out of his reach.</p><p>Hyeseong Kim scored the game-winning run to give Los Angeles the 2-1 victory. The Dodgers’ World Series title defense was still alive.</p><p>Phillies players were seen consoling Kerkering in the dugout as he stared out at the field in disbelief.</p><p>Philadelphia drew first blood in the top of the seventh. Nick Castellanos doubled to left field and scored Max Kepler. Philadelphia just needed to use its depth in the bullpen to keep Los Angeles at bay and live to play at least one more game.</p><p>However, Cristopher Sanchez walked Mookie Betts. It allowed Justin Dean to score and tie the game.</p><p>The Dodgers received a huge pitching performance from Roki Sasaki. The rookie, who was originally signed over from Japan to be a starter, delivered three scoreless innings for the Dodgers. He struck out two on 36 pitches.</p><p>It was an all-around game that helped the Dodgers win the game and finish the series.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Earle-Sears comes out swinging in heated debate as Spanberger dodges Jay Jones questions</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears came out swinging against what she called former Rep. Abigail Spanberger’s dodges on calls for fellow Democrat Jay Jones to drop out of the attorney general contest after texts envisioning the murder of a Republican leader came to light.</p><p>Throughout the debate, Spanberger mostly declined to make eye contact with Earle-Sears and ignored her when she was interrupted.</p><p>Earle-Sears repeatedly addressed Spanberger directly during both women’s answers but did not receive any direct responses in return.</p><p>Early on, Earle-Sears interrupted Spanberger, asking her to give a direct answer. The Democrat told the moderators she was "aware of these messages" and that they were "absolutely abhorrent."</p><p>"I denounced them when I learned of them and I will denounce them every chance I get," Spanberger said, as Earle-Sears interjected once more to attempt to press for a straight answer.</p><p>"I didn’t hear an answer on [the Jones] question," co-moderator Deanna Albrittin told Spanberger.</p><p>Since Earle-Sears had already called for Jones to drop out, the moderators asked her instead about President Donald Trump’s stated "hate" for political opponents after the murder of Charlie Kirk.</p><p>Earle-Sears later turned to Spanberger and admonished her for refusing to give a yes-or-no answer on Jones, asking whether it would take Jones "pulling the trigger" to actually condemn what he had said about then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah.</p><p>The Republican was later asked whether she needs Trump’s endorsement, as he has explicitly endorsed lieutenant governor candidate John Reid but offered more muted comments for Earle-Sears during the span of the race.</p><p>Earle-Sears also criticized Spanberger for purportedly waiting several days before condemning a left-wing protester’s racist sign at an Arlington anti-transgender-sports demonstration headlined by the Republican candidate.</p><p>The sign said that Earle-Sears should not be able to share water fountains (as a Black woman) if transgender students cannot share bathrooms.</p><p>In the latter regard, moderator Tom Schaad asked Spanberger whether transgender girls born male should be able to use female bathrooms and be on co-ed sports teams.</p><p>"Nothing is more important to me than their safety and their experience in schools," Spanberger said, before offering a lengthier answer that also cited her experience as a former federal agent investigating crimes against children.</p><p>"That work, in part, has earned me the endorsement of the Police Benevolent Association," she said.</p><p>Schaad reiterated the question, saying there had been no direct answer, and later attempted to ask whether Spanberger would rescind an executive order by Gov. Glenn Youngkin laying out a bathroom policy along biological lines.</p><p>"My opponent will not answer the question because she voted for men nude in girls' locker rooms," Earle-Sears later said.</p><p>Later, both candidates were asked whether they would continue or undo any specific policies from Youngkin – whom the moderators reported enjoys high approval ratings as he closes out his last three months of his term.</p><p>Earle-Sears said she would not disclose private conversations with Youngkin but that she would not undo their progress.</p><p>Spanberger said she would continue Youngkin’s efforts to grow advanced nuclear power in the commonwealth.</p><p>After the event, Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, Jr., D-Portsmouth, spoke to reporters as a surrogate for Spanberger.</p><p>Scott said there is a "double standard" in pressuring Spanberger to call for Jones to drop out, claiming Earle-Sears has not denounced violent rhetoric from Trump.</p><p>The speaker, who represents the area just south of the debate site, claimed Earle-Sears did not as vociferously condemn Trump for a remark he made in 2024 when discussing neoconservatism, and former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney’s aisle-crossing endorsement of Kamala Harris.</p><p>"Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK? Let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face," Trump said as a rebuttal to people in the political establishment who are war "hawks" or support proverbial forever-wars.</p><p>The Trump campaign noted at the time that the president did not call for Cheney to be executed and that the press covered the remark "disgracefully," while fact-checker PolitiFact deemed the comment illustrative of a "combat zone" situation rather than a call for murder.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the Earle-Sears campaign for comment on the debate, including the way the candidates comported themselves on stage.</p><p>"If you’re wondering who’s capable of leading Virginia, this was the debate to watch," Earle-Sears spokesperson Peyton Vogel told Fox News Digital.</p><p>"Abigail Spanberger couldn’t even look Lt. Gov. Earle-Sears in the eye and confirmed she will not stand up to Jay Jones’ threat-laced, murderous rhetoric."</p><p>"If she can’t lead her own ticket, she can’t lead the Commonwealth," Vogel said.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Natasha Cloud warns against WNBA's declining activism edge, recalls pivotal 2020 season: 'We saved democracy'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The WNBA has experienced unprecedented growth and attention over the past few seasons.</p><p>New York Liberty guard Natasha Cloud reflected on how players have wielded the league’s growing influence, particularly during the 2020 season. That year marked the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, while incidents of police brutality sparked social justice and equality protests across the U.S., bringing the height of the Black Lives Matter movement to the forefront.</p><p>That summer, in the bio-secure bubble in Florida, players across the WNBA used their platforms to display activism. Cloud was among those who spoke out.</p><p>She credited WNBA players with being leading voices and helping preserve democracy in America at a pivotal moment.</p><p>"I just wish that during this time we would have a little bit more voices from our league because there was a point where we saved democracy in 2020, and no one wants to give us that. But you were one of the heads of leading that and doing it in a very loud and harsh way, but a very subtle and graceful way," Cloud said during a recent appearance on "A Touch More with Sue Bird &amp; Megan Rapinoe.</p><p>"Which really just galvanized and impacted the sports world to do the same, and it put pressure on people."</p><p>While Cloud views 2020 as a hallmark year, she also expressed concerns about the decline she's seen in advocacy in today's WNBA.</p><p>"Every part of activism is important," Cloud said. "I just don’t want to lose that as the W because we always have been on the forefront, and I would say, like, the last two or three years I’ve seen us kind of fall back for the protection of obviously our families and how we provide for our families."</p><p>Cloud averaged 10.1 points and 5.1 assists per game in her first season with the Liberty. She joined the Phoenix Mercury in 2024 and spent the first eight seasons of her WNBA career with the Washington Mystics.  </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

The performers have been accused of normalizing or "artwashing" the Saudi Arabian regime with their entertainment.</p><p>One comedian who refused to participate in the festival, Atsuko Okatsuka, shared purported screenshots of a contract that performers allegedly had to sign ensuring their content did not violate the guidelines of the Saudi Arabian government. </p><p>The contract reportedly prohibited "any material considered to degrade, defame, or bring into public disrepute, contempt, scandal, embarrassment, or ridicule" the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>"This is, obviously, something that’s become a big part of the news because people, a lot of comedians especially, are very upset, because the people who paid the comedians to come to this are not good people. It’s a pretty brutal regime. They’ve done a lot of horrible, horrible things," Kimmel told Ansari, asking him why he'd done it.</p><p>Ansari answered that he put a great deal of thought into his choice to attend, noting an aunt of his who lived there for some time argued there are plenty of people in Saudi Arabia who don’t agree with what their government is doing, just like in the United States.</p><p>While Kimmel agreed in theory that "we’re doing horrible things over here" in America, he argued the Saudi Arabian government is clearly on a different level.</p><p>"They murdered a journalist. These are not good people over there," Kimmel said, in reference to the infamous state-sponsored murder of Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey in 2018.</p><p>"I was just there to do a show for the people," Ansari replied. "Whenever there’s repressive societies like this, they try to keep things out — whether it’s rock ‘n’ roll music or blue jeans — because it makes people curious about outside ideas, outside values. And this is a very young country. Like, half the country is under the age of 25, and things can really change. And, to me, a comedy festival felt like something that’s pushing things to be more open and to push a dialogue."</p><p>He said he hoped he'd pushed things "in a positive direction."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Denise Richards felt 'shameful' after leaked nudes, says daughter couldn't attend church</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>LOS ANGELES — Denise Richards continues to relive painful moments from her past. </p><p>On Wednesday, the "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" alum, who was granted a temporary restraining order against estranged husband Aaron Phypers July 17 amid their ongoing divorce, said her ex's alleged effort to destroy her reputation not only left her feeling ashamed and "embarrassed" but also affected her children.</p><p>According to Richards, weeks after Phypers filed for divorce from the reality TV star, the 53-year-old allegedly leaked nude photos of his estranged wife. </p><p>"It’s been difficult for my daughters, especially with the naked photos," Richards, who shares two daughters with ex Charlie Sheen, and one daughter with Phypers, told the judge during Wednesday's court proceedings. "I'm so embarrassed and shameful as a mom. [My daughter] couldn't go to church."</p><p>In July, Richards petitioned the court, claiming Phypers stole her computer and "disseminated private information, including nude photographs" to various news outlets. Judge Nicole Bershon ordered that Phypers return the device within 48 hours.</p><p>On July 29, the judge forbade Phypers from distributing any "private" or "sensitive information" or any photos of a sexual nature that he may have downloaded from her phone or computer.</p><p>"Aaron stole my laptop and sent private text messages he had stolen from my laptop without my permission. Aaron threatened that I would 'disappear' if I called the police," Richards wrote in her petition for a temporary restraining order.</p><p>In a statement to People magazine, Phypers denied Richards' allegations: "I absolutely deny the false allegations that I violated the restraining order or stole Denise's laptop or cell phones. These claims are not only untrue — they are being weaponized to damage my reputation and distract from the truth."</p><p>During Wednesday's hearing, Richards' attorney, Brett Berman, put Phypers in the hot seat. </p><p>"How did you obtain [those photos]," he asked.</p><p>"I took pictures with my phone of her phone," Phypers said. "This was stuff she was hiding from me. I didn't think it was private. … My wife was cheating on me."</p><p>When Berman asked Phypers if he thought disseminating this private material would have been "in violation" of Richards' privacy, he responded, "No absolutely not. She was already sharing with someone."</p><p>After Berman asked Phypers how he would feel if the roles were reversed, sensitive photos were released of him, he replied, "If I put it out there, I put it out there."</p><p>Phypers filed for divorce from Richards July 7. He cited irreconcilable differences and is seeking spousal support from the "Real Housewives" star.</p><p>A judge granted Richards' request for a temporary restraining order against Phypers amid their ongoing divorce on July 17.</p><p>"Throughout our relationship Aaron would frequently violently choke me, violently squeeze my head with both hands, tightly squeeze my arms, violently slap me in my face and head, aggressively slam my head into the bathroom towel rack, threaten to kill me, hold me down with his knee on my back to the point where I would have to plead with him to get off me so that he would not kill me and hack into my laptop and phone and download all of my text messages," Richards claimed in the documents, filed July 16.</p><p>"Aaron regularly threatened to ‘break my jaw’ and would cry, beg me to stay, and promise to get help – none of which ever happened. Aaron has caused me at least three concussions.</p><p>"Until now, I have been afraid to report Aaron to the police or file for a restraining order because he has repeatedly threatened to kill himself and me if I reported him to the police, among his other threats of harm to me and himself if he is reported for his abuse to anyone," Richards continued. </p><p>Phypers denied all allegations of mental or physical abuse in a statement at the time.</p><p>"I want to address recent rumors and speculation that have surfaced regarding my relationship with my wife, Denise Richards," he told People. "Let me be unequivocally clear: I have never physically or emotionally abused Denise – or anyone. These accusations are completely false and deeply hurtful. Denise and I, like many couples, have faced our share of challenges, but any suggestion of abuse is categorically untrue. I have always tried to approach our marriage with love, patience, and respect."</p><p>In court on Wednesday, Phypers again denied all physical abuse allegations. When asked by his attorney if he ever threatened to kill Richards, he said, "No, never." He later added, "I don't abuse my wife, no."</p><p>Phypers also testified that Richards' black eye was self-inflicted. "She said she fell, hit a pole," Phypers said, adding that Richards had been drinking tequila.</p><p>Phypers additionally testified that Richards called him 17 times in less than a week after she was granted the temporary restraining order. </p><p>For her part, Richards acknowledged she "called five times because this was after I had seen and heard … the pictures … and hearing about the things he was saying about me in the press I was just so … finding this in itself is so scary for me," she said, while crying on the stand.</p><p>During Monday's proceedings, Richards described multiple allegations of physical and emotional abuse as she detailed terrifying incidents that left the mother of three fearful for her life. </p><p>At one point during the hearing, Richards pleaded for a tissue and began crying while recalling a particularly abusive event in May. Richards claimed Phypers got "very volatile" with her at the Four Seasons hotel just hours after the reality TV star had undergone multiple cosmetic surgeries – including a face-lift. </p><p>Phypers allegedly tried to search through Richards' devices while she was sleeping. He allegedly hit her face and damaged a drain in the process.</p><p>"That is when I really, really knew that our marriage was over because there's been physical abuse, but it kept getting worse and worse," Richards testified. "But the fact that he did that to me five hours after coming out of a seven-hour surgery … made me feel a lot of things. Scared and vulnerable. I couldn't walk by myself.</p><p>"And the person I looked to as my husband to protect me wasn't anymore. That's when I really, really knew there wasn't going back. To do that to your wife coming out of surgery?</p><p>"I felt broken and defeated and so alone and just so vulnerable because I just had an extensive surgery. Him knowing the body and wellness and working on people ... and to do that to your wife?"</p><p>On Tuesday, Richards took the stand again to detail Phypers' alleged "manic" behavior throughout their relationship. </p><p>In response to the alleged leaked photos that were released of her by Phypers, Richards sent him a video — a part of which was played in court — referring to Phypers as a "narcissist" and detailing multiple instances of alleged physical abuse. </p><p>"You were the last person I thought would do that to me," Richards told Phypers via video recording that was presented in court. "I don't know why I'm having a hard time with this. Things were bad with Charlie and I, but he never hit below the belt.</p><p>"I told my dad, I just don't know why I believed you and I loved you, and I really thought you were my soulmate," she continued. "I never in a million years thought we were getting divorced."</p><p>Richards denied any infidelity but accused Phypers of stepping out on their marriage. </p><p>"You can claim I cheated, but I didn't," she said. "You did do stuff. And I don't care how long ago it was. The fights were so f---ing bad, especially after your family moved [into their shared home]. I tried my best to not have it be as bad as it was. I tried my hardest. I just could not do that s---show anymore."</p><p>"Aside from hitting me as much as you did and filing a police report … claiming that I hit you in the chest three times and scratched your eye. Like, come on," she continued. "Low blow. And I get you're upset that I filed the restraining order, but you hit me one too many f---ing times. Each time was getting worse and worse it was. You were manic," she alleged.</p><p>"You were the one person that I always thought I could trust and that would protect me, and you were the f---ing opposite," she added. "I think I'm having such a hard time because I was married to someone I never f---ing knew."</p><p>In court documents filed Sept. 29 and obtained by Fox News Digital, Phypers' lawyers named Richards' ex, Charlie Sheen, and "RHOBH" alum Brandi Glanville as witnesses. </p><p>In the filing, Phypers' attorneys stated that Sheen could testify regarding "Denise's history of not being truthful and of drug and alcohol abuse." </p><p>Richards and Sheen tied the knot in 2002 and were married for just under three years before Richards filed for divorce in March 2005, when she was pregnant with their second daughter, Lola. They welcomed their first daughter, Sami, one year prior. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Senate advances 2026 defense bill after weeks of delay as shutdown drags on</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Senate advanced its version of a colossal package to authorize funding for the Pentagon on Thursday in the midst of the ongoing government shutdown.</p><p>The 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which had been gathering dust as lawmakers worked to break through holds on the bill for over a month, advanced in the upper chamber on a bipartisan vote. The legislation would authorize roughly $925 billion in defense spending.</p><p>However, successful advancement of the bill after a marathon Senate vote on amendments came as the government entered Day 9 of the government shutdown with no clear end in sight. Lawmakers in the upper chamber aren't expected to return until Tuesday, all but guaranteeing that military service members won't get their paychecks next week. </p><p>Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, R-Miss., formally announced the breakthrough on the Senate floor after Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., teased a possible vote Thursday morning. Wicker noted that in a particularly partisan moment in the upper chamber, the NDAA was able to sail through committee earlier this year on a near unanimous vote.</p><p>"In this time, when we can't seem to muster up a 60-vote majority to keep us in business as a federal government, we were able to pass the National Defense Authorization Act by a vote of 26-to-1," Wicker said.</p><p>Lawmakers were finally able to move on the legislative package after Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., dropped his hold on the measure.</p><p>Gallego had called for a vote on his amendment that would have prevented Ashli Babbitt, who was killed during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, from receiving military funeral honors. The Air Force extended an offer for military funeral honors for Babbitt in August.</p><p>Senators charged through over a dozen partisan amendments and a massive batch of roughly 50 add-ons to the legislative package before moving the bill. The House passed its own version last month.</p><p>Among the failed amendments was one from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., which would have blocked money to retrofit a Boeing 747 that President Donald Trump accepted from the Qatari government earlier this year.  </p><p>Another, from Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., would have prevented Trump and governors around the country from signing off on sending the National Guard from one state to another if a governor or mayor rejected the move. </p><p>One successful amendment, from Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., would repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force for Iraq, which, at the time, authorized President George W. Bush to use the U.S. military as he deemed "to be necessary and appropriate" in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001.</p><p>It would also repeal a similar resolution passed in 1991 during the Gulf War. The House's version of the bill included repeals of both authorizations, too. </p><p>However, Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., had vowed to block the package Thursday afternoon in an effort to "secure a hearing to investigate this gross abuse of our military" in response to Trump sending the National Guard to Chicago and other cities across the country.</p><p>But she backed off her threat after Wicker promised a hearing on the matter "in the coming weeks."</p><p>"I look forward to asking tough questions of the Trump administration about their unconstitutional National Guard deployments to American cities against state and local officials' objections," she said in a statement. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">New York AG Letitia James' indictment sparks sharp partisan divide</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Lawmakers reacted sharply Thursday to the indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James on bank fraud charges, with Democrats calling it a politically motivated act of revenge by President Donald Trump.</p><p>A federal grand jury in Virginia charged James with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. The indictment centers on James’ purchase of a home in Norfolk. Prosecutors allege she falsely claimed it as a second residence to secure better loan terms before leasing it to tenants. James has denied wrongdoing, describing the charges as "political retribution."</p><p>"These charges are baseless, and the president’s own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost," James said in a statement.</p><p>James, a longtime Trump adversary, previously sued the president’s business empire for civil fraud and won a nearly $500 million judgment.</p><p>Lindsey Halligan, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said James faces up to 30 years in prison per count, up to a $1 million fine on each count and forfeiture if she's convicted.</p><p>"No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public’s trust," Halligan said. "The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served."</p><p>In a statement, U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said James has weaponized her office to go after Trump and his allies. </p><p>"Her hypocrisy is profound as she campaigned on the mantra that 'no one is above the law,' yet she now faces allegations of committing the very type of financial misrepresentation she baselessly pursued against President Trump," Stefanik said. </p><p>"I have spearheaded congressional efforts to expose James' abuses over the past several years through ethics complaints, bar complaints, public demands for investigations and oversight exposing her corruption". </p><p>Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., noted James' past statement that "no one is above the law." </p><p>"Today, Leti[t]ia James was indicted for bank fraud regarding a mortgage loan," she wrote on X. </p><p>Democrats rallied to her defense, accusing Trump of abusing his power.</p><p>"The politically motivated indictment of Attorney General Letitia James is an abuse of power — a weaponization of government — at its most outrageous and egregious," said Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y. "Rather than addressing the grocery and utility bills crushing American families, Donald Trump remains pathologically preoccupied with his personal enemies list."</p><p>Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., called the charges a "blatant abuse of power," while New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the case amounted to "nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department."</p><p>New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani praised James as "a champion for justice," saying Trump’s actions showed "fascist tactics — prosecuting his opponents, weaponizing the federal government and attacking the very fabric of our democracy."</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump was using the Justice Department as his "personal attack dog."</p><p>"This is what tyranny looks like," Schumer said. "President Trump is targeting Attorney General Tish James for the ‘crime’ of prosecuting him for fraud — and winning. This isn’t justice. It’s revenge."</p><p>Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, called the indictment "political weaponization of our courts, plain and simple — and proof that when you stand up to corruption, they come for you."</p><p>James' initial court appearance is scheduled for Oct. 24 in Norfolk, Virginia.</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>NBA fans may have to wait slightly longer than expected to see LeBron James make his debut for his 23rd season.</p><p>On Thursday, the Los Angeles Lakers confirmed that James is experiencing sciatica. The team expects him to miss three to four weeks. Lakers head coach JJ Redick added that James is "on his own timeline."</p><p>James had already missed both of this month's preseason games with a lower-body injury. He has not fully participated in training camp practices due to what Redick described in late September as "a little bit of nerve irritation in the glute."</p><p>Redick added that the NBA's all-time leader in minutes "probably (needs) a little bit longer of a ramp-up leading into opening night."</p><p>According to Johns Hopkins, sciatica, also known as lumbar radiculopathy, "is a pain that originates along (the) sciatic nerve" and radiates down the back of an affected person's leg.</p><p>The Lakers have four games remaining on their preseason schedule. James' latest setback will force him to miss the entire exhibition slate for the first time in his NBA career.</p><p>Earlier this week, James revealed that his much-teased "second decision" had nothing to do with his basketball future. Instead, a social media rollout helped launch an ad campaign for a limited-edition Hennessy bottle inspired by James' signature crowning gesture.</p><p>The Lakers went 6-6 in contests without James during the 2024-25 season.</p><p>The Golden State Warriors will visit the Lakers Oct. 21 to open both teams' regular season. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Democrat Virginia gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger faced repeated questioning during Thursday’s debate over her continued support for attorney general candidate Jay Jones after text messages surfaced in which he fantasized about putting "two bullets" in the head of then-Republican Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert.</p><p>Both the debate moderators and her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, repeatedly asked Spanberger whether she still endorses Jones, but Spanberger did not say outright that she no longer endorsed him.</p><p>Spanberger also would not say when she became aware of the inflammatory text messages, which also included violent rhetoric about Gilbert's children. </p><p>"Jay Jones advocated the murder — Abigail — the murder of a man, a former speaker, as well as his children who were 2 years and 5 years old. You have little girls. Would it take him pulling the trigger? Is that what would do it?" Earle-Sears asked. "Please ask him to get out of the race. Have some courage."</p><p>The text scandal has proven to be a major flashpoint in the race as concerns about violent political rhetoric have reached new heights after the assassination of Charlie Kirk and two attempted assassinations of President Donald Trump. </p><p>"We just want to clarify, what you're saying is, as of now, you still endorse Jay Jones as attorney general?" the moderator asked Spanberger. </p><p>"I'm saying, as of now, it's up to every voter to make their own individual decision. I am running for governor. I am accountable for the words that I say, for the acts that I take, for the policies that I have put out," Spanberger responded. "I am responsible for the policies I put out and the work I will endeavor to do tirelessly for the people."</p><p>Spanberger did repeatedly point out that she condemned the rhetoric the moment she learned of it and that she will denounce violent rhetoric at every opportunity she gets. </p><p>Meanwhile, Spanberger accused Earle-Sears of only condemning violent rhetoric when it is targeting her political party but not when it targets her opponent's. She cited an example from Kirk's memorial service last month, during which Trump reportedly said, "I hate my opponent and I don't want the best for them."</p><p>"It is important that candidates always denounce violence no matter which side of the aisle. … We should always be focused and forceful in our denouncement of it," Spanberger said as she was peppered with questions on whether she would denounce Jones. "My opponent unfortunately only denounces violence when her side is the target."</p><p>In response to those accusations, Earle-Sears did not condemn the president's words but did say it was something she would not say herself personally. </p><p>"As I've said before, I would not say that," Earle-Sears said of the Trump comments.</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Cleveland Browns rookie Shedeur Sanders responded to recent comments made by former NFL coach and current ESPN pundit Rex Ryan Thursday. </p><p>Last week, Ryan condemned Sanders for his behavior during a segment on the network's "Get Up" show. </p><p>"This kid runs his mouth like, ‘I got could be a starting quarterback,’ with his arms crossed like this. Get your a-- in the front row and study and do all that. If I know, the whole league knows," Ryan said of Sanders. </p><p>"Quit being an embarrassment that way. You got the talent to be a quarterback. You should be embarrassed that you’re not the quarterback now."</p><p>Sanders responded to the criticism while speaking to reporters after Thursday's practice. </p><p>"He's just trying to start something," Sanders said. </p><p>"We not on no negativity from now on. We not doing that. I'm just here to be positive, and I don't speak on anything negative. That's the new way, that's what we going forward with. Anything negative, we not talking about it, we not speaking on it."</p><p>Sanders also addressed the public response to an incident last week, when reporters asked him his response to teammate and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel being named the team's starting quarterback. Sanders responded by mouthing words without saying anything. </p><p>"I guess not everybody likes playful all the time," Sanders said. "So, it's to understand how to be at all times and keep my personality a little bit slimmer, I guess. Because not everybody understands it at all times, and you may not have a full time to be able to explain things."</p><p>After the team traded away veteran quarterback Joe Flacco this week, Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski didn't confirm that Sanders would move up to the second-string spot behind Gabriel for Sunday's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Stefanski told reporters he will "let the week play out" before deciding between Sanders and practice squad quarterback Bailey Zappe.</p><p>Sanders said he sees a "light at the end of the tunnel" regarding the situation.</p><p>"I'm in a great mental space overall," Sanders said. "So, I would say you tend to get a little bit more excited when you see a light at the end of the tunnel, for sure. … Whatever my role is here, I'm thankful.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Dozens of Angel parents and families of fentanyl victims are calling for President Donald Trump to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, pointing to his unprecedented efforts to combat drug cartels, human trafficking and illegal immigration.</p><p>In a letter sent Thursday to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, members of The American Border Story (TABS), representing Angel parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants and families who have lost loved ones to fentanyl, urged recognition of Trump's leadership in bringing "peace and security" to neighborhoods across the country.</p><p>"Fentanyl took my child’s life, and it’s taken thousands more," Anne Fundner, whose son died from an overdose in 2022, told Fox News Digital. "President Trump didn’t look the other way. He went after the cartels and the traffickers poisoning our kids. He’s the only one who made this fight a priority, and because of that, lives have been saved. That’s why he deserves this recognition."</p><p>The families credit Trump with identifying cartels and traffickers as a "war machine that destroys lives." They say he made border security a priority and took action to halt the flow of drugs and violent criminals into the U.S. in a way no other leader has.</p><p>While many world leaders have sought peace abroad, the families say Trump's efforts have been focused on peace "right here at home."</p><p>Joe Abraham, whose daughter Katie Abraham was killed in a hit-and-run allegedly by an illegal immigrant earlier this year, said Trump is the only leader who treated the border crisis as a national emergency.</p><p>"My daughter was killed by someone who never should have been in this country," Abraham told Fox News Digital. "He stood up to the cartels, secured the border and fought to protect families like mine. That’s not just leadership, that’s bringing peace to American communities."</p><p>The group argues that the Nobel Peace Prize — created to honor those who reduce war and promote peace — applies to Trump's efforts to dismantle cartel operations.</p><p>"The Nobel Peace Prize was created to honor those who work for fraternity among nations, reduce the engines of war, and promote peace," the letter states. "Today, the greatest war many of us face is not in some faraway battlefield, it is in our backyards, waged by cartels that profit from human misery. President Trump understood this, and he has worked tirelessly to end it."</p><p>The letter was dated the same day Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., announced he was tapping Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize following his landmark agreement to end the Israel-Hamas war. Pro-Israel activist Lizzy Savetsky went further Thursday, suggesting that the Nobel should be renamed in Trump's honor to mark the world-changing achievement.</p><p>The deadline for this year’s nominations was Jan. 31. While some proposals for Trump came in before then, many arrived after the cutoff. If he does not win when the prize is announced Friday, he could be considered again next year.</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., mocked the Democratic Party’s obsession with identity politics along with female Republican governors during a podcast appearance on Thursday.</p><p>Throughout comedian Trevor Noah’s "What Now?" show, Sanders criticized the Democratic Party for no longer helping the working-class voter and focusing too much on race and gender politics.</p><p>He argued that President Donald Trump’s Cabinet and multiple female Republican governors throughout the country proved that diversity alone was not a productive goal.</p><p>"Look, all of us want to see parts of our society have good representation in Congress, and we're making some progress," Sanders said. "Donald Trump has surrounding him a whole lot of women. There are right-wing women governors all over this country, right? Are we all very proud? Oh man, thank God we got a woman in politics who does not believe in women's right to control her own body, who, you know, is terrible to workers and so forth, but we're proud that she's a woman!</p><p>"The issue is … Democrats have retreated from class issues, from economic issues, from a desire to take on big money to, ‘Oh, isn't it wonderful? We have a woman here, and we have a gay person here, and we have a Black person here and a Latino person over there.’"</p><p>There are four female Republican governors: Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte and Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds.</p><p>In a statement to Fox News Digital, Sanders blasted the senator's comments and his conditional support for women.</p><p>"Bernie Sanders made it clear: He only cares about women if they support his radical left agenda. President Trump believes in empowering every woman — and everyone — in America, and I’m proud to have his support as the first woman to lead my state and the youngest governor in the country," she said.</p><p>Sanders also criticized what he called the "Democratic establishment" during the "Flagrant" podcast in May, similarly mocking the party’s focus on identity politics.</p><p>"You know, is every gay person brilliant and wonderful and great? No, of course not. Everybody's a human being. So, the issue is, what you stand for? Which gets you back to what we discussed earlier. Class politics, in the sense of, which side are you on?" Sanders said. </p><p>"Are you going to stand with working families? Are you going to raise the minimum wage to a living wage or not? Are you going to guarantee — fight to guarantee — healthcare to all people or not? Are you going to demand that the wealthiest people [start] paying their fair share of taxes or not? Those are the issues, and no one cares what color you are, you know, what your gender is, etc."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">MSNBC panel uses Katie Porter backlash to blast 'double standard' for women in politics</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A panel on MSNBC’s "Chris Jansing Reports" on Thursday discussed whether the recent backlash against California Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter was because of a "double standard" against women in politics.</p><p>On Wednesday, Politico released an unseen clip from 2021 that showed Porter yelling at a staff member to "get out of my f------ shot!" during a video interview.</p><p>"Look, it’s uncomfortable to watch, as was the first one," Jansing said about the clip. "But here’s my question: Would the reaction be different if the candidate was a man? Is there still a double standard for women in politics, or is this just bad?"</p><p>Former Lincoln Project advisor Tara Setmayer said the clip was "bad all around," but that there was "absolutely" a double standard for women in politics.</p><p>"All you have to do is look at how Hillary Clinton was treated when she ran for president versus Donald Trump," Setmayer said. </p><p>"Look at how Kamala Harris was treated last year against Donald Trump. Look at the way the media treats people in the administration like Stephen Miller, who can have a meltdown on television, or Donald Trump threatening people constantly, or Tom Homan, the ICE czar, the border czar, and the nasty things he says. Go down the list of men who behaved badly but are seemingly rewarded for that with more power.</p><p>"So there is clearly a double standard in the way that society views how women behave versus men and what’s considered good and bad behavior. And that shouldn’t be the case. But with this case, with Katie Porter, that is just bad."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Porter’s campaign for comment.</p><p>Porter has come under fire over the last few days after clips of past interviews went viral. One clip from Tuesday night received backlash from both liberal and conservative journalists after it showed Porter threatening to end an interview with CBS California's Julie Watts.</p><p>In the clip, Porter grew visibly impatient with Watts’ follow-ups and even attempted to leave at one point in frustration, calling her interviewer "argumentative." Porter told Watts after being pressed that she didn't "want to have an unhappy experience" with her and that she didn’t "want this all on camera."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Pro-Palestinian agitators accused of being behind a riot Tuesday are now being charged with "promotion of anarchy" after the melee left several officers injured.</p><p>The Boston Herald reported that the Suffolk District Attorney’s Office on Thursday upgraded charges for all 13 suspects, who are now accused of violating a state law that makes "promotion of anarchy" illegal and is a felony charge, according to court documents.</p><p>On Tuesday night, between 200 and 300 people participated in a pro-Palestinian demonstration in downtown Boston that quickly descended into a riot. Thirteen people were arrested after police allege they became violent toward law enforcement officers.</p><p>A spokesperson for the district attorney's office told the Herald the upgraded charges come after a Boston Police Department review of posters promoting the so-called protest, which feature a quote from a Hamas spokesperson and a burning police cruiser.</p><p>"Peace be upon your souls that will one day soar in the skies of your liberated Al Quid’s and Al Aqsa, purified from the defilement of your killers," the poster read, according to police.</p><p>Because of that, police determined there was probable cause that the group "intended to conduct their rally and march in such a way that it induced fear, caused destruction and disruption, caused injury and promoted anarchy."</p><p>Four police officers were injured during the riot.</p><p>"Further investigation revealed violent imagery and rhetoric used in promotional media for the Oct. 7 incident," the DA's spokesperson said. "This organizing material promoted violence against police and presented an immediate threat to public safety which, combined with the actions of the individuals arrested, provided clear justification for the enhanced charges."</p><p>Boston police said the group "surrounded police cruisers, kicked vehicle doors and resisted dispersal efforts," adding that "several officers were assaulted during this period, including one struck in the face.</p><p>"As violence escalated," police said, more officers were sent to the area while the agitators "continued to resist dispersal."</p><p>Officers reported that the rioters were forcibly removing and damaging their equipment.</p><p>"During the disturbance, officers reported equipment being forcibly removed or damaged, including body-worn cameras, radios, bicycles and other duty gear," the agency said.</p><p>Police made arrests for unlawful assembly, violent resistance and obstruction of emergency response efforts, along with a slew of other charges including assault.</p><p>Osama El Khatib, 26, Roder Atwood, 21, Atalanta Carrig-Braun, 20, Haley MacIntyre, 24, Madeline Weikel, 27, Jacob Pettigrew, 22, Amun Prophet, 25, Laith Hintzman, 19, Benjamin Choucroun, 20, Owen Woodcock, 26, Prahlad Iyengar, 25, Styx Hatch, 19, and Gabrielle Smith, 28, were arrested on Tuesday night.</p><p>Bail was set on Wednesday and Thursday for those arrested, ranging from $500 to $10,000.</p><p>Notably, bail for Atwood, El Khatib and Hatch was set at $10,000. The Suffolk County District Attorney's Office alleges that Khatib punched police officers to help fellow suspects escape without being arrested. While the district attorney's office requested $5,000 cash bail, the judge set bail at $10,000.</p><p>The Boston Herald reported that Atwood allegedly broke a police officer's nose during an assault, according to prosecutors.</p><p>Suffolk County DA Kevin Hayden sent a message to future protesters in a statement on Wednesday: Remain peaceful or face prosecution.</p><p>"These defendants were not in court today because they were protesting," Hayden said. "They were in court because they committed crimes. If you assault police and commit other offenses, you’re going to be arrested and prosecuted, period.</p><p>"Peaceful protests happen all the time in this city," he said. "We support everyone’s right to protest. But these individuals chose against protesting peacefully, and they are now facing the consequences of those choices."</p><p>According to Boston.com, the initial protest was organized by local Students for Justice in Palestine chapters, which coincided with the two-year mark of the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas.</p><p>The protest was intended to "flood downtown for Palestine."</p><p>According to the report, people yelled "F--- you, Nazis" and "BPD is KKK" as they refused to leave the area.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Minnesota attorney general says trans athletes in girls sports 'doesn't harm anyone' despite complaints</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison responded to dozens of school board members who are urging the state to keep biological males out of girls sports by saying the issue "doesn't harm anyone."</p><p>A letter penned by more than 40 school board members expressing support for policy revisions to enforce Title IX and protect girls sports prompted the response from Ellison this week. </p><p>"Letting the very small number of transgender students in Minnesota play on their school sports teams doesn't harm anyone, but segregating them does," part of Ellison's statement read. </p><p>Ellison said this despite the fact that multiple girls high school athletes in his state have spoken out about how the experience of facing trans athletes has impacted them, and some have even filed a lawsuit over the issue. </p><p>Three anonymous Minnesota high school girls filed a lawsuit against the state's education agencies in the spring after having to compete against a transgender softball pitcher. </p><p>One of the plaintiffs previously told Fox News Digital about what it was like playing against the trans pitcher.</p><p>"This issue has affected me in ways that I never imagined. It’s simply unfair, and I hate that nothing is happening to change that. Boys should not be able to take girls' spots on teams just because they are capable of doing so. I hope that more girls affected by this issue will stand up against this." the player said. </p><p>Another anonymous player directly called out Ellison for supporting the policies that have allowed the trans pitcher to play against females.</p><p>"It’s really upsetting to know that [Ellison] isn’t taking rights of girls and women seriously. He is allowing boys to compete with girls, and it is not safe and completely unfair. To know that AG Ellison is in complete support of letting boys and men take advantage of females in sports is absolutely disgusting and wrong," one anonymous player previously told Fox News Digital. </p><p>Former White Bear Lake High School softball player Kendall Kotzmacher previously told Fox News Digital that losing to a trans pitcher in the state tournament left her in tears.</p><p>"How do you acknowledge that you lost to a biological male? How do you process those events that happened? And that was something that entire night, I still couldn't do it. … We lost to a biological male in a female state tournament," Kotzmacher said. </p><p>Minnesota's education agencies face a deadline Friday from the U.S. Department of Education to change their trans athlete policies. President Donald Trump signed the "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" executive order in February, but Minnesota was one of the first states to openly defy the order.</p><p>Ellison then filed a lawsuit against Trump and the Department of Justice over the executive order and appears staunchly opposed to complying with the DOE's Friday deadline. </p><p>"Exclusion is a violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act, which has protected the rights of trans kids to participate in all extracurricular activities for decades," Ellison's statement continued. </p><p>"I too am concerned about the Trump Administration’s threats to cut education funding for kids across Minnesota, but this matter is before the court right now. The federal government's threats violate the U.S. Constitution, Minnesota law, and Title IX itself. I’m fighting to prevent these harmful cuts, stop the Administration's bullying of transgender kids who just want to live their lives in peace, and protect the rights and freedoms of all our students in Minnesota."</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and top Democrats refused to answer whether they believe embattled Virginia Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones should drop out over violent text messages he sent, fantasizing about murdering a Republican opponent.</p><p>The Virginia attorney general race, and gubernatorial race along with it, have been rocked by recent revelations that Jones, a former Democratic member of the Virginia House of Delegates, has made several violent remarks, including saying he wanted to shoot then-Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert.</p><p>Though some Democrats, including Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger, have condemned Jones’ messages, Sanders, perhaps the top progressive voice in America, ignored Fox News Digital’s question about the texts and simply walked away.</p><p>Another prominent progressive, Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., also ignored Fox News Digital’s questions about Jones, turning her back on the reporter and stepping into an elevator.</p><p>Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., provided some answers, saying, "I’ll be honest with you, I don’t recall exactly what he said, but at least the reflections I got, I thought it was horrible, I really do."</p><p>"I don't know the dynamics of the race, as I'm focused right now on the New Jersey governor's race. So, I can't say that I've done my due diligence to really understand, but what I will say is what I saw was absolutely horrible," Kim added.</p><p>Kim also said, "I hope that in a time right now where there's so much concern about political violence. We can say that, yes, we need to make sure we're holding ourselves up to a high standard, especially those in elected office."</p><p>Asked if he could say whether Jones should drop out of the race after those violent texts, Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., answered, "I can't. I've got to go."</p><p>Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., also had a similar response, saying, "No, I’m getting a briefing right now," while a staffer said, "You’re more than welcome to reach out to her office though."</p><p>In text messages with another lawmaker, Jones wrote, "Three people, two bullets. Gilbert, Hitler and Pol Pot. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head."</p><p>Jones wrote in a subsequent text, "Spoiler: put Gilbert in the crew with the two worst people you know and he receives both bullets every time."</p><p>In another text exchange with a colleague, Jones said he hoped Gilbert’s children would die. He doubled down in a series of messages, saying that such grief might be "a good thing" if it advanced his politics.</p><p>Though the text revelations have shocked the public and turned the Virginia elections on their head, many Democrats questioned by Fox News Digital have refused to address the scandal or say whether they believe Jones should be disqualified from the race.</p><p>Asked whether Jones should quit his race, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., answered, "I haven’t given it a thought."</p><p>Pressed whether he had read the text messages, which have caused massive political fallout in an already tight Virginia election, Whitehouse said, "I have not."</p><p>Prominent Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., simply responded, "I don’t have time at the moment," and continued to walk away.</p><p>Speaking with Fox News Digital, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, called the Democratic senators’ silence "staggering, particularly with the spate of political violence we have seen."</p><p>"In my view, the notion that someone advocating for the murder of children because he disagrees politically with their father is manifestly unsuitable for public office, especially the chief law enforcement officer of Virginia, and I wish there were even one Democrat with the courage to say that publicly," said Cruz.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Jennifer Aniston is setting the record straight on why she never became a mother.</p><p>During a recent interview with Harper's Bazaar U.K., the 56-year-old "Friends" star opened up about why she chose to write an op-ed for The Huffington Post in 2016, addressing the long-standing rumors regarding why she never had children.</p><p>"They didn’t know my story or what I’d been going through over the past 20 years to try to pursue a family because I don’t go out there and tell them my medical woes," she said about the rumors. "That’s not anybody’s business. But there comes a point when you can’t not hear it — the narrative about how I won’t have a baby, won’t have a family, because I’m selfish, a workaholic. It does affect me. I’m just a human being. We’re all human beings."</p><p>At a certain point, she recalled thinking, "What the hell?" and wrote the op-ed "because I knew a lot of women at the time who were trying to have kids" and were going through the process of IVF. She explained that her decision to write the piece "was not only for myself but for any women who were struggling with the same issue."</p><p>Rumors of the actress putting her career over starting a family began after her divorce from actor Brad Pitt in 2005, with many speculating he left her because she didn't want to have a child. In reality, Aniston had privately been trying IVF, which ultimately was unsuccessful.</p><p>In the 2016 op-ed, Aniston slammed the media for defining "a woman’s value based on her marital and maternal status," saying she and her husband at the time, Justin Theroux, were being "harassed by dozens of aggressive photographers staked outside our home" trying to snap a photo of her and "uncover whether or not I am pregnant (for the bajillionth time... but who’s counting)."</p><p>"I have grown tired of being part of this narrative. Yes, I may become a mother some day, and since I’m laying it all out there, if I ever do, I will be the first to let you know. But I’m not in pursuit of motherhood because I feel incomplete in some way, as our celebrity news culture would lead us all to believe," she wrote. </p><p>"I resent being made to feel "less than" because my body is changing and/or I had a burger for lunch and was photographed from a weird angle and therefore deemed one of two things: 'pregnant' or ‘fat.’"</p><p>The actress discussed her fertility journey in a November 2022 interview with Allure, in which she admitted, "It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road." </p><p>She further explained that the "years and years and years of speculation" were difficult for her and now that she is past that point in her life, she "actually feel[s] a little relief now because there is no more, 'Can I? Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.'"</p><p>"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So, here I am today. The ship has sailed."</p><p>While she felt it was important to speak her truth at the time, Aniston now says, "The older I get, the less I care about correcting a narrative," because eventually the truth will come out on its own.</p><p>"The news cycle is so fast, it just goes away. Of course, there are times when I feel that sense of justice – when something has been said that isn’t true, and I need to right the wrong," she told Harper's Bazaar U.K. "And then I think, do I really? My family knows my truth, my friends know my truth."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Manila, Philippines </em>— A 7.4-magnitude earthquake Friday morning off the southern Philippines killed at least two people, damaged a hospital and schools, knocked out power and prompted evacuations of coastal areas nearby due to a possible tsunami.</p><p>President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., facing his latest natural disaster after <span class="link">a previous, deadly earthquake</span> and back-to-back storms, said the potential damage was being assessed and rescue teams and relief operations were being prepared and would be deployed when it was safe to do so. </p><p>The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said it was expecting damage and aftershocks from the quake, which was centered at sea about 27 miles east of Manay town in Davao Oriental province and was caused by movement in the Philippine Trench at a depth of 14 miles. But it canceled a tsunami warning it had issued.</p><p>At least two people died after being pinned in damaged houses in Davao Oriental, provincial Governor Nelson Dayanghirang Sr. told ABS-CBN News Channel, adding that about 250 patients were evacuated from a damaged hospital and would be temporarily housed in tents.  </p><p>Office of Civil Defense deputy administrator Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV said several buildings sustained cracks in their walls, including an international airport in Davao city, but it remained operational without any flights being canceled, Alejandro said.</p>
<p>"I was driving my car when it suddenly swayed and I saw powerlines swaying wildly. People darted out of houses and buildings as the ground shook and electricity came off," Jun Saavedra, a disaster-mitigation officer of Gov. Generoso town in Davao Oriental, told The Associated Press by cellphone. </p>
<p>"We've had earthquakes in the past, but this was the strongest," Saavedra said, adding that the intense ground swaying caused cracks in several buildings, including a high school from which about 50 students were brought to a hospital by ambulance after sustaining bruises, fainting or becoming dizzy due to the earthquake.  </p><p>Gov. Generoso is a town about  62 miles south of Manay, where classes at all levels were also suspended.</p><p>Wes Caasi, a local official in Tagum city, northwest of Manay, told French news agency AFP that a government event at the city hall was thrown into chaos as "the people panicked, they screamed and ran."</p><p>Caasi said he saw city workers scrambling down a 202-meter (220 yard)-high metal Christmas tree they were decorating when the quake hit.</p>
<p>Other witnesses said they saw students and workers poured out of schools, office buildings and shopping malls.  </p><p>Children evacuated schools in Davao city, which has about 5.4 million people and is the biggest city near the epicenter, about 155 miles west of Davao Oriental province.</p>
<p>The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu said small waves were detected on the coasts of the Philippines and Indonesia before the threat passed about two hours after the quake. It said small sea fluctuations may continue.  </p><p>Alejandro warned that tsunami waves could hit six nearby coastal provinces from Davao Oriental up to two hours after the temblor struck at 9:43 a.m. "We urge these coastal communities to be on alert and immediately evacuate to higher grounds until further notice," Alejandro said in a video news briefing. </p><p>Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency said small tsunami waves were detected in North Sulawesi province with heights ranging from 1.3 to 6.7 inches in Melonguane, Beo, Essang and Ganalo in Talaud Islands districts.</p><p>The Philippines is <span class="link">still recovering from a Sept. 30 earthquake</span> with a magnitude of 6.9 that left at least 74 people dead and displaced thousands of people in the central province of Cebu, particularly in Bogo city and outlying towns. </p><p>The archipelago also is lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms each year, making disaster response a major task of the government and volunteer groups. </p>
<p>Also Friday, an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.0 struck off the coast of Papua New Guinea. The U.S. Geological Survey said it was centered in the Bismarck Sea 257 miles northeast of Lae, the South Pacific island nation's second-most populous city. </p><p>Lae police official Mary Jane Huafilong said no damage was reported.</p>

<div class="article-title">Sister Jean, beloved chaplain of Loyola Ramblers basketball team, dies at 106</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, BVM — who became world-famous as the chaplain and biggest fan of the Loyola University Ramblers men's basketball team — has died.</p><p>Sister Jean died Thursday, Oct. 9, the university confirmed. She was 106.</p><p>"In many roles at Loyola over the course of more than 60 years, Sister Jean was an invaluable source of wisdom and grace for generations of students, faculty, and staff," Loyola President Mark C. Reed said in a statement. "While we feel grief and a sense of loss, there is great joy in her legacy. Her presence was a profound blessing for our entire community and her spirit abides in thousands of lives. In her honor, we can aspire to share with others the love and compassion Sister Jean shared with us."   </p><p>The university said it will announce funeral arrangements soon.</p><p>"Sister Jean Dolores was a woman of prayer, dedicated educator, and a bearerof hope who loved her BVM Community," BVM President LaDonna Manternach said. "She saw God present in all that surrounded her and trusted in His goodness. Her presence with us will be greatly missed."  </p>
<p>Sister Jean was born Aug. 21, 1919, in San Francisco. She played basketball at St. Paul High School, according to Angelus News.</p><p>But long before that, as a third grader, she was inspired by her teacher, a member of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or BVMs, and had a calling to join the order herself.</p><p>Sister Jean headed to Dubuque, Iowa to join the BVM order after graduating from high school. She received her habit at the BVM motherhouse on March 19, 1938.</p><p>In the 1940s, Sister Jean began her ministry in elementary education in the Los Angeles area.</p>
<p>As a teacher at St. Charles Elementary School in North Hollywood, Sister Jean started a sports program — and coached women's basketball, softball, volleyball, track, ping-pong, and yo-yo, Loyola University said.</p><p>While teaching on weekdays, Sister Jean pursued a college education — taking classes on Saturdays and during the summer. She earned a bachelor's degree in English at Mount Saint Mary's College, now University, and a master's degree at Loyola University of Los Angeles, now Loyola Marymount.</p><p>After completing her master's degree, Sister Jean moved to Chicago and began teaching college courses at Mundelein College in 1961. She was named acting dean of Mundelein College in 1970, having already served as associate dean and director of summer sessions, Loyola said.</p><p>Sister Jean served continued teaching and serving in several other administrative positions at the all-women's Mundelein College, until the school merged with Loyola University Chicago in 1991. At that point, Sister Jean became an assistant dean and academic advisor at Loyola.</p><p>In 1994, Sister Jean was 75 and ready to retire, Loyola said. But she had a new calling to help student athletes maintain their grades and thus keep up their eligibility.</p><p>She soon became chaplain of the men's basketball team — offering pregame prayers and becoming crucial to the team's success.</p><p>Sister Jean offered more than spiritual guidance to the players. She also provided a scouting report on their opponent during prayer before every game.</p>
<p>"I tell them guys to watch out for on the other team and to not let anybody get under their skin," she told CBS News Chicago in 2017. "We ask God to keep us free from injuries and play with great sportsmanship. We pray for the referees that they can see clearly and fairly."</p><p>In 2018, Sister Jean was catapulted to international celebrity during the Ramblers' Cinderella Final Four run. They won the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament to appear in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1985 — and the Final Four for the first time since 1963.</p><p>Sister Jean became a star along with the team. Orders for a Sister Jean bobblehead broke records, and Sister Jean got a shout-out from former president and Chicago resident Barack Obama.</p><p>After the 2018 season, Sister Jean remained a visible presence at games and on campus. </p><p>In 2023, Sister Jean published a book, "Wake Up with Purpose! What I've Learned in My First 100 Years."</p><p>Two years later, at the age of 106, <span class="link">Sister Jean retired</span> from all her roles at Loyola amid health concerns.</p><p>On her 106th birthday, Sister Jean wrote a message to the Loyola community — directed at students in particular as they began a new academic year.</p>
<p>"It has been wonderful for me to be with you these years and to watch you grow spiritually, intellectually, and socially, and to see the friends you've made. And to see the progress you've made in your academic life. I've always been happy to share my time with you," she wrote in part. "Let your dreams become reality. Don't let anybody stop you. You are the future leaders of our churches, our schools, our country, and our world."</p>

<div class="article-title">Chicago federal judge temporarily blocks National Guard deployment in Illinois</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A federal judge on Thursday granted a restraining order temporarily blocking the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, <span class="link">after state and local leaders objected to the deployment</span>.  </p><p>In a ruling from the bench, U.S. District Judge April Perry said no National Guard units may be deployed in Illinois for the next 14 days. A full written ruling will be published on Friday, and Perry said she expects her order will be appealed.</p><p>The restraining order expires at 11:59 p.m. on Oct. 23, but Perry has scheduled a telephone hearing for 9 a.m. on Oct. 22 to determine if it should be extended for another 14 days.</p><p>Perry's ruling means National Guard units already sent to the Chicago area cannot operate on the mission they were sent for — to protect federal agents and facilities in Illinois, including a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Broadview, where 45 soldiers arrived overnight.</p><p>While the restraining order remains in effect for 14 days, the Trump administration had moved to deploy troops in Illinois for at least 60 days, so it's very possible both sides will be back in court before the restraining order expires.</p>
<p>Perry said her decision came down to a "credibility determination," and she found the Department of Homeland Security's assessment of recent events in the Chicago area to be "unreliable."</p><p>The judge ruled there is no credible evidence of an organized rebellion in Illinois, despite multiple protests and some assaults against federal agents, nor was there any evidence that the federal government has been unable to enforce the law without bringing in troops amid an ongoing <span class="link">immigration crackdown in the Chicago area.</span></p><p>The judge said there is "no doubt there have been acts of vandalism and assaults" during the ICE operation in Chicago, but she could not agree that local law enforcement have been unable to handle the situation, calling the Trump administration's claims otherwise "unreliable." </p><p>She also noted that federal grand juries have <span class="link">refused to indict a number of protesters</span> who were arrested outside the Broadview ICE facility, casting "significant doubt" on Homeland Security's credibility and assessment of what's happening on the streets in the Chicago area.</p>
<p>The judge also said there is overwhelming evidence that deploying troops would lead to civil unrest, and said the provocative nature of ICE agents' actions, and in some cases constitutional violations, has led to an increase in protest activity already.</p><p>"I find that allowing the National Guard to deploy will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants have started," she said.</p><p>Because the National Guard is not trained in law enforcement functions or de-escalation tactics, the judge said allowing troops at the Broadview ICE facility or anywhere else would not be responsible, noting state and local police have indicated they are able to provide protection and keep the peace.</p><p>The judge said adding militarized and untrained troops to the situation would not be in the community's best interest.</p><p>In a statement Thursday night, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said: "Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like [JB] Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court."</p><p>Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said he believes the judge "did a very careful job of weighing the evidence" and "made the correct decision to enter a temporary restraining order."</p><p>"This is an important decision not just for the state of Illinois, but for the entire country. The question of states' sovereignty was addressed in this decision. The question of whether or not the President of the United States should have unfettered authority to militarize our cities was answered today," he said.</p>
<p>In a statement, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson called the judge's ruling "a win for the people of Chicago and the rule of law."</p><p>"Judge Perry echoed many of the points that we have made repeatedly: Trump's deployment is illegal, unconstitutional, dangerous, and unnecessary. There is no rebellion in Chicago. There are just good people standing up for what is right," Johnson said. "The judge established that the Trump administration is unreliable. They lie, misrepresent, and put people in danger. We will continue to use all of the tools at our disposal to end the Trump administration's war on Chicago." </p><p>Gov. JB Pritzker also praised the judge's ruling in a post on X.</p><p>"Donald Trump is not a king — and his administration is not above the law.  Today, the court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois.  And no place for the National Guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago," Pritzker wrote.</p><h2>Lawsuit filed by Chicago and Illinois called Trump's deployment of troops "patently unlawful"</h2><p>In a lawsuit suit, filed Monday, the state of Illinois and city of Chicago claimed that the Trump administration's "deployment of federalized troops to Illinois is patently unlawful." </p><p>"Plaintiffs ask this court to halt the illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional federalization of members of the National Guard of the United States, including both the Illinois and <span class="link">Texas National Guard</span>," the lawsuit states.</p><p><span class="link">The federal government filed its response with moments to spare</span> before a midnight deadline Wednesday night, in a 59-page filing that argued President Trump has the legal authority to deploy the troops and that state objections should not block the operation. </p>
<p>Attorneys for the federal government also argued the courts should be "highly deferential" when reviewing a president's judgment, saying it's within the scope of the authority the executive branch is given by the Constitution and statutes.</p><p>Perry began hearing arguments in the case at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse in Chicago at 11 a.m., and noted at the start of proceedings that the hearing has taken on new urgency because in the time between the lawsuit being filed Monday and today's hearing, the government has already deployed 500 National Guard troops to Illinois and Chicago. </p><p>The judge initially declined to grant an emergency temporary restraining order in the hours after the lawsuit was filed but warned the federal government they should "take a pause" on deployment amid the legal proceedings. </p><p><strong>READ MORE: <span class="link">U.S. District Court chief judge says National Guard not needed at Dirksen Federal Building</span></strong></p><p>Lawyers for the state of Illinois and the federal government gave opening statements before being questioned for hours by Judge Perry. Many of her questions focused on what exactly the National Guard would be authorized to do in their capacity of "protecting" federal property and federal agents. </p><p>Judge Perry admitted the open-ended nature of the president's order is cause for concern. </p><p>The federal government's attorneys argued repeatedly that the president's judgment in deciding to federalize the National Guard in Illinois is not reviewable by the courts, and declined to articulate clear parameters on the guard's orders because the situation is fluid. They said orders issued would be tailored to the needs of the moment. </p>
<p>Would they be limited to protecting ICE? The attorney for the government said probably. When Judge Perry asked if the guard might go into neighborhoods, hospitals and schools, the attorney said there is a vetting process but didn't describe it. </p><p>Could they help any federal agency? The government's attorney answered, "I actually don't know the answer to that."</p><p>And the big question: Will they be fighting crime in Chicago? "Certainly to an extent," the Trump administration's attorney said. "The mission, again, is a federal protection one."</p><p>The attorneys repeatedly cited violence and "riots" in Illinois, particularly at the Broadview ICE facility, but the judge questioned whether the government was presenting an accurate representation of the violence on the ground, at one point pointing out the gulf between statements made on social media and reporting in Illinois.</p><p>We do know 45 members of the Texas National Guard were at the Broadview ICE facility ahead of Thursday's hearing. In the state's opening argument, they mentioned internal communications from the person in charge at Broadview said "the situation was under control."</p><p>Perry also asked the government's lawyers about two temporary restraining orders issued against ICE in the past 48 hours for violations of the First and Fourth amendments — one in a lawsuit in Chicago filed against ICE by reporters and media members, the other filed by an immigration attorney to prevent ICE from searching his phone — which the government said they were not aware of. </p><p>Perry questioned the government about its definition of the "danger of rebellion," and what acts would comprise such a rebellion. At one point, when asking the government about threats made toward ICE and other federal agents, Perry noted, "I agree with you about threats across the U.S. now. Mine started about 10 minutes after I got the case."</p>
<p>Perry had fewer questions for the state, asking them about their definition of rebellion, the distinction between state and local law enforcement powers and military forces and their objections to using the military to protect federal property. Illinois attorneys argued the power to determine military conditions belongs to Congress, and they do not believe the president can summon troops to places where other law enforcement can be used effectively.</p><p>Perry also asked about why they think a temporary restraining order is necessary. Attorneys for Illinois referenced statements made by Mr. Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, particularly at the meeting of generals and other military leaders who were called to the Pentagon. </p><p>In closing arguments, the state argued the president doesn't have the authority to send in troops to fight crime, and said the case is full of bad faith and abandonment of public virtues, and presents a "risk of wanton tyranny." </p><p>The federal government argued in return that there is coordinated and complex violence in Illinois, and the president has a right to respond. They argued that a temporary restraining order would interfere with the president's decision to protect personnel and property. </p><p><span class="link">Mr. Trump has claimed </span>that Chicago is "out of control" as justification for sending in the National Guard, and <span class="link">his administration and the Department of Homeland Security have claimed</span> that federal agents and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities need protection from protesters.</p><p>The president once again spoke about Chicago on Thursday, thanking Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for his troops and "doing what has to be done." Chicago Mayor Johnson reacted to his latest comments outside court, saying, "We said that this deployment had nothing to do with public safety. We said that this has nothing to do with immigration. This is purely political." </p>

<div class="article-title">New York AG Letitia James indicted in Virginia</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A grand jury in Virginia indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James on Thursday, marking the second Trump foe to face federal prosecution in recent weeks.</p><p>James was charged with one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. The <span class="link">indictment alleges</span> that James bought a house in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020 with a mortgage that required her to use it as a second home, but she ultimately rented it to a family and used it as an investment property. It accuses her of misrepresenting how the house was used to get a lower interest rate.</p><p>The indictment says James purchased the home for $137,000 and borrowed $109,600 — and by getting more favorable lending terms and a larger seller credit, she allegedly saved herself $18,933 over the life of the loan.  </p><p>Lindsey Halligan, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement: "No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust."</p><p>James called the charges "baseless" in a video statement.</p>
<p>"This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system," she said.</p><p>James's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said James "flatly and forcefully denies these charges" and said he is "deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge."</p><p>James has drawn Mr. Trump's ire for years. Her office sued the president and the Trump Organization for fraud in 2022, leading a judge to issue a nine-figure judgment against the company. Mr. Trump has referred to James as "scum," "corrupt" and "racist."</p><p>The indictment came exactly two weeks after a grand jury in the same Virginia courthouse <span class="link">voted to indict</span> another Trump adversary, former FBI Director James Comey, on charges of lying to Congress. James was indicted by a different grand jury than the one that indicted Comey, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Last month, Mr. Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into Comey, James and a third longtime Trump antagonist, Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.</p><p>In May, CBS News <span class="link">reported</span> that the Justice Department had launched a criminal probe into James around alleged mortgage fraud. Three months later, the Justice Department <span class="link">expanded its investigation</span> into James for her office's handling of its Trump Organization probe.</p><p>The mortgage fraud investigation began after William Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, <span class="link">wrote a letter to Bondi</span> alleging that James "has, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records to acquire government backed assistance and loans and more favorable loan terms."</p><p>Pulte claimed James received deals on mortgage terms by falsifying information related to several different properties over the course of decades — not including the 2020 purchase that led to Thursday's charges. Pulte's allegations include listing another home in Norfolk, Virginia, as her "principal residence" despite living and working in New York, buying a five-family property in Brooklyn with a loan that is only available for homes with four units or less, and an accusation that in 1983, James' father signed mortgage documents stating they were husband and wife.</p><p>James denied the allegations at the time, calling them "baseless." </p><p>In April, Lowell — an attorney for James whose firm frequently represents clients that it believes have been unfairly targeted by the Trump administration — sent a letter to the Department of Justice refuting the allegations laid out in Pulte's letter. </p><p>Lowell called the allegations "long-disproven" and referred to the investigation as "the latest act of improper political retribution — this time directed at Ms. James — publicly instigated and endorsed by President Trump."</p>
<h2>DOJ charges another longtime Trump foe</h2><p>Mr. Trump has sparred with James since she was elected New York attorney general in 2018 and began pursuing cases against the president, his businesses and his administration.</p><p>In the civil <span class="link">lawsuit</span> against Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization, James' office accused the company of fraudulently inflating the value of its real estate assets to gain more favorable lending terms in what she called "the art of the steal," a play on the name of Mr. Trump's book, "The Art of the Deal." The president denied wrongdoing, and he and his <span class="link">attorneys</span> lashed out at James, characterizing the case as politically motivated.</p><p>After a trial that delved deeply into Mr. Trump's <span class="link">business empire</span>, a judge <span class="link">ordered</span> the president and his company to pay a judgment in excess of $350 million — which <span class="link">ballooned to over a half-billion dollars</span> including interest. Judges on New York's appellate court later <span class="link">tossed out</span> the judgment over the summer, calling it "excessive."</p><p>Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has taken the unprecedented step of encouraging the Justice Department to look into people who he believes wronged him during his first term or his four years out of office — including Comey and James. </p><p>The moves have been met with some internal backlash. The acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, <span class="link">resigned last month</span>, amid concern from prosecutors in the office that the Trump administration could fire him for failing to prosecute James.</p><p>Siebert was <span class="link">replaced</span> as interim U.S. attorney by Lindsey Halligan, a former Trump attorney and White House aide. Just days after she was sworn in, the office asked a grand jury to indict Comey for allegedly lying during a Senate hearing five years ago.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump-aligned attorney Ed Martin — who leads the Justice Department's new Weaponization Working Group — pressed James to resign as state attorney general in an August letter obtained by the Associated Press.</p>

<div class="article-title">Tropical Storm Jerry could become hurricane by weekend, forecasters say</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Tropical Storm Jerry could become a hurricane by the weekend, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said early Thursday.</p><p>Tropical storm conditions are possible later today into Friday on portions of the northern Leeward Islands as Jerry passes nearby, forecasters said.</p><p>As of 11 p.m. ET Thursday, Jerry's core was some 100 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands, the Caribbean chain east of Puerto Rico that starts with the Virgin Islands and extends down to Guadeloupe. </p><p>Jerry had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph as it moved northwest at 17 mph, forecasters said, adding that "gradual strengthening is forecast during the next few days and Jerry could become a hurricane by late Friday or Saturday."</p><p>Tropical storm warnings were in effect for Anguilla, Barbuda, Sint Maarten, St. Barthelemy and St. Martin. Tropical storm watches were in effect for Antigua, Montserrat, Nevis, Saba, St. Eustatius and St. Kitts, as well as Guadalupe and the adjacent islands.</p>
<h2>Maps show Jerry's path</h2><p>On the forecast track, Jerry's center is expected to pass near or northeast of the northern Leeward Islands later today and tonight, the hurricane center noted. It wasn't <span class="link">posing any threat to southern Florida</span>.</p>
<p>"Through Friday," the center said, "two to four 4 inches of rain with local storm total maxima to six inches are expected across the Leeward and Virgin Islands. This rainfall brings a risk of flash flooding, especially in urban areas and in steep terrain."</p><p>What's more, "Swells generated by Jerry are beginning to reach the Leeward and Windward Islands. These swells will spread westward toward the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico tonight, then toward the rest of the Greater Antilles over the next couple of days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions."</p>
<h2>Hurricanes this season</h2><p>Jerry strengthened into a tropical storm Tuesday and is the 10th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. It developed on the heels of several Atlantic storms, including <span class="link">Hurricane Humberto</span> and <span class="link">Hurricane Imelda</span>, which emerged at the end of September. Concerns that both could strike Bermuda briefly circulated, but only Imelda ultimately brushed the coast of the island as a Category 2 hurricane before quickly weakening on its way out to the open ocean.</p><p>Humberto and Imelda also hit the southeastern United States with destructive surf, causing multiple coastal homes in North Carolina's Outer Banks <span class="link">to collapse</span>.</p>
<p>This has been a relatively <span class="link">quiet hurricane season</span>, which typically runs annually from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. While Jerry is the 10th named storm this year, just one of the nine others — <span class="link">Chantal</span> — actually made landfall in the U.S. </p><p>When the current season began, <span class="link">an outlook</span> released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration indicated that between 13 and 19 named storms would form in the Atlantic, with up to nine becoming hurricanes and as many as five strengthening into powerful Category 5 storms. But, as the months progressed, <span class="link">NOAA revised its outlook</span> in August to predict that 13 to 18 named storms would form, including five to nine hurricanes.</p>

<div class="article-title">Candidates in Virginia governor's debate clash over shutdown and violent rhetoric</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Republican Winsome Earle-Sears and Democrat Abigail Spanberger faced off for the first and only time on the debate stage Thursday night <span class="link">in Virginia's high-stakes gubernatorial race</span>. </p><p>It was a fiery affair in which <span class="link">Earle-Sears</span>, who is trailing in the race, went on the offensive from the very beginning, repeatedly interrupting <span class="link">Spanberger</span> and asking her several direct questions.</p><p>Spanberger, who largely avoided addressing her Republican opponent directly, sought to cast a bipartisan tone at times. Over the course of the hourlong affair, the candidates sparred over violent rhetoric, <span class="link">the federal shutdown</span> and transgender children. The economy was largely an afterthought. </p>
<p>Virginia is one of just two states choosing governors this November, and its election is often seen as a bellwether for the party in power across the Potomac River ahead of midterm elections next year.</p><p>Washington politics are especially relevant this year in Virginia, as President Trump's cuts to the federal workforce and Congress' current government shutdown have an outsize impact in a state filled with federal employees and military personnel.</p><p>Here are some takeaways from the debate at Norfolk State University:</p>
<p>Perhaps even more than policy differences, the candidates' personal styles shaped the hourlong debate. </p><p>Earle-Sears, with her only chance to confront Spanberger before Election Day, was far more aggressive. She repeatedly turned toward Spanberger and addressed her by her first name, interrupting almost every answer, despite being admonished by the moderators over and over.</p><p>The approach put the Democrat on the defensive after months of running the race largely on her own terms as the perceived frontrunner.</p><p>Spanberger, while she criticized her opponent at times, faced forward throughout, avoided eye contact, and only rarely addressed Earle-Sears directly. She did not speak during Earle-Sears' answers, even when her opponent asked direct questions, which happened often.</p>
<p>Earle-Sears also told Spanberger she "should have stayed in Congress" and frequently questioned her truthfulness.</p><p>"Don't lie like that, Abigail!" she shouted at one point.</p><p>The interruptions lasted up until the very final moments of the debate when the moderators cut off the microphones.</p><p>A scandal shaped the very beginning of the debate, although it was not a scandal directly involving either candidate onstage.</p><p>Instead, it was <span class="link">the Democratic candidate for attorney general</span>, Jay Jones. He has been heavily criticized in recent days following last week's publication of text messages from 2022 in which he suggested that Virginia's former Republican House speaker get "two bullets in the head." </p><p>While Spanberger had previously shared "disgust" about Jones's words, heading into Thursday night's debate she had not called for him to drop out of the race, while Mr. Trump and Earle-Sears publicly pressed Jones to do so. Over and over again Thursday night, Earle-Sears pushed Spanberger on whether she would do the same.</p><p>Earle-Sears, in her first comment of the debate, took an unrelated question about the state's vehicle tax and questioned Spanberger over the Jones issue. When asked by a moderator about Jones, Spanberger quickly denounced the text messages, as she had soon after they became public last week. But she was evasive when asked whether she continued to endorse Jones. After being pressed about the topic, Spanberger tried to distance herself from Jones and said it was up to voters to make an individual decision. </p>
<p>"Abigail, what if he said it about your three children? Is that when you would say it's time to get out of the race?" Earle-Sears asked. She later added of Spanberger, "She has no courage."</p><p>Spanberger had largely avoided the issue in the days leading up to the debate, aside from issuing a public statement condemning the texts. But facing repeated questions from the moderators and her opponent, she was forced to weigh in. The Democratic congresswoman declined to say whether Jones should leave the race, saying it's up to voters to make their own decision.</p><p>"Are you saying political murder is OK?" Earle-Sears charged. </p><p>"Once again, I have denounced political violence, political rhetoric, no matter who is leading the charge," Spanberger responded, pointing to violent rhetoric from Mr. Trump that Earle-Sears declined to denounce and trying to sound a bipartisan tone. </p><p>"You routinely refer to me as your enemy. I'm not your enemy. You are not my enemy. We are political opponents," Spanberger said.</p><p>In the race to succeed Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who under state law cannot run for another term this year, Spanberger has been viewed as having a sizable advantage. But statewide races in Virginia can become surprisingly close by election day, and Jones' words have been met with bipartisan backlash and helped galvanize Republican momentum.   </p><p>The clash comes as threats of political violence have escalated across the country following the shooting deaths of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and former Minnesota Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband.</p>
<p>The showdown over the shutdown flared Thursday night.</p><p>The federal shutdown, which has been underway for more than a week, is especially prevalent in Virginia, home to roughly 315,000 federal workers. Even before much of the federal government closed its doors last week, many Virginians were already affected by Mr. Trump's spring push to slash federal jobs and his ongoing threats to impose more mass firings.</p><p>Earle-Sears, a vocal Trump supporter, had perhaps the more difficult challenge during the debate. She argued that she is best positioned to strengthen the state's economy, even as she was reluctant to criticize the Republican president's job cuts in the state.</p><p>She declined to criticize Mr. Trump or call on him to end the shutdown when asked directly by the moderators Thursday.</p><p>Instead, she blamed Democrats for the mess and called on Spanberger to push Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both Democrats, to vote in favor of a spending bill that would end the impasse with the Republican-controlled Congress. </p><p>Spanberger complied.</p><p>"I would encourage everyone, our Democratic senators, our Democratic House members, our Republican House members, to work and come back to the table," she said. </p>
<p>Many voters say they're most concerned about the direction of the economy, but some of the most pointed moments of the debate were focused on cultural issues.</p><p>In particular, Earle-Sears pressed Spanberger on whether she would keep transgender youths out of high school sports and bathrooms.</p><p>The Republican lieutenant governor has flooded the airwaves with ads focused on the cultural divide that helped Mr. Trump win the presidency last fall, casting Spanberger as unwilling to protect Virginia's children from sexual predators. </p><p>"My answer is that each local community decision should be made between parents and educators and teachers in each community," Spanberger said, pointing to her background in law enforcement and role as a mother.</p><p>"Nothing is more important to me than the safety of all children," she said.</p><p>Spanberger declined to say whether she would rescind the measure signed by Youngkin that would require students to go only to the restrooms of their birth gender.</p><p>That did not satisfy Earle-Sears, who pressed Spanberger on what she would say if her own children were forced to undress in a bathroom with biological males. The Republican also implied that transgender students are a safety threat when asked.</p>
<p>"We know that biological men are larger in strength than women," she said. "This is biology."</p><p>Two women stood on the debate stage as the Democratic and Republican nominees for the first time in state history, a reminder that Virginia is poised to elect its first female governor, no matter who wins on Nov. 4.</p><p>Spanberger, 46, is a mother of three school-age children. She has represented a congressional district in northern Virginia since 2019. Her background is in law enforcement as a former CIA agent. </p><p>In one of the few warm exchanges of the night, Earle-Sears pointed to her role as a mother when asked what qualities she likes about her opponent. </p><p>"I believe she is a devoted mom. I truly believe that," Earle-Sears said. "And I do believe that she cares."</p><p>Earle-Sears, a Marine veteran, may be better known statewide, having served as lieutenant governor for the last four years. A native of Jamaica, the 61-year-old mother of two, is the first Black woman elected to statewide office in Virginia. </p><p>Spanberger complimented parts of her record. </p>
<p>"I admire her faith," Spanberger said, "and her service to this country."</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Maine Gov. Janet Mills is expected to launch a campaign for Senate on Tuesday, two Democratic sources familiar with her plans confirmed to CBS News.   </p><p>A Democrat, Mills is vying to unseat longtime Republican Sen. Susan Collins in one of the most closely watched contests of next year's midterm elections.</p><p>Mills' planned campaign launch was first reported by Axios.</p><p>Mills, who is term-limited, has served as governor of Maine since 2019, after working as the state's attorney general. She drew national attention earlier this year when she <span class="link">verbally argued</span> with President Trump at a White House event after he pressed Maine to comply with his administration's push to block transgender girls and women from competing in female sports.</p><p>"See you in court," Mills said to Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>Mills was a top recruit for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. She will enter an expanding primary field that includes three other Democratic contenders — among them Graham Platner, an oyster farmer who has emerged as a rising progressive and anti-establishment voice. </p><p>The Maine Senate race could mark a <span class="link">rare opportunity</span> next year for Democrats to flip a GOP-held seat and contest the Senate's 53-47 Republican majority, despite an otherwise challenging Senate terrain. Maine leans Democratic, with Joe Biden defeating Mr. Trump by 9 percentage points in 2020 and Kamala Harris beating Mr. Trump by 7 percentage points last year.</p><p>But Democrats have struggled for years against Collins, a five-term incumbent with a track record of breaking with Mr. Trump and her congressional Republican colleagues. She won reelection in 2020 by an 8.6-point margin, despite Democratic nominee Sara Gideon spending nearly $62.9 million on the race — more than double Collins' $29.6 million.</p>

<div class="article-title">California bill targeting loud streaming ads signed into law by Gov. Newsom</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Believe it or not, an 8-month-old's sleep schedule is what led to a face-off between California lawmakers and the entertainment industry over loud commercials on streaming services.</p><p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 576 into law this week. The bill, introduced by state Senator Tom Umberg, prohibits Netflix, Prime Video, and other streamers from blasting commercial volume way above the level of whatever show or movie you're watching in California.</p><p>This mission began when Zach and Rachel Keller were doing what new parents do: settling in to watch TV after finally getting their daughter, Samantha, down for the night.</p><p>That is when a blaring commercial abruptly ended their moment of peace, waking Samantha again.</p><p>"A lot of times, we have the volume so low that we just have subtitles running and still, the commercial ad volumes are so ear-piercing that it wakes her up," Rachel Keller said.</p>
<p>Federal law already prohibits regular TV broadcasters from running commercials that are way louder than the program you're watching. However, streaming services weren't around when lawmakers passed the federal Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act back in 2010. So it doesn't apply to them.</p><p>Zach Keller works for Senator Umberg and approached him about closing that loophole.</p><p>"I thought, 'I've got three kids, eight grandchildren. That's a good idea,' Umberg told CBS News California in August before Newsom signed the bill. "I think it's one of the most popular bills in the legislature, but it's not popular with everyone."</p><p>The bill was unanimously passed by the state Senate and sailed through its Assembly committee, but it stalled before its final vote as the powerful Motion Picture Association fought hard to kill the bill, arguing it could hurt small independent streaming services.</p>
<p>Unlike the broadcasting cable networks, streaming ads come from several different sources and cannot necessarily or practically be controlled by streaming platforms.</p><p>"'Are you kidding?' That's my response [to that]. They know which hand I use to basically control the remote. They can basically figure out how to make them within a normal range," Umberg said in August.</p><p>None of the streaming services responded to our emails, and the Motion Picture Association declined an interview.</p><p>As for Samantha and her very tired parents, they hope this ultimately helps babies across the country sleep a little more soundly.</p><p>"We heard Californians loud and clear, and what's clear is that they don't want commercials at a volume any louder than the level at which they were previously enjoying a program," Newsom's office said in a statement after the bill was signed into law.</p><p>The Kellers weren't the only ones who had been frustrated. Forum and forum, and review after review, people across the country have complained about loud streaming commercials and ads.</p><p>SB 576 demonstrates the power of the California lawmakers to do something the federal government can't.  </p>
<p>In a state this big, companies generally don't create one policy or product for California and another for everyone else. So as goes California, goes the nation.  </p><p>Now signed by Newsom, the commercial volume restrictions for streaming services will go into effect on July 1, 2026.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>During his regular checkup, a 9-year-old clouded leopard named Masala undergoes a procedure to get a tiny heart monitor implanted under his skin at the <span class="link">Smithsonian's Conservation Biology Institute</span> in Front Royal, Virginia.</p><p>Rosana Moraes, a Brazilian biologist, studies how high-stress levels in animals can hinder their ability to thrive and breed. Masala's new heart monitor will record changes in his body temperature, hydration and heart rate — which all tell a lot about an animal's level of stress and anxiety.</p><p>Moraes calls it a "gigantic" leap forward in animal care. </p><p>Clouded leopards are agile climbers that live in trees. In the wild, their population is in steep decline due to habitat destruction and illegal hunting for their coats and body parts. Masala is part of a breeding program to help preserve the vulnerable species. Lately he's been anxious and biting his tail, and they're not exactly sure why. The heart monitor will help biologists understand the exact moments when Masala becomes stressed.</p><p>In the wild, using a minimally invasive procedure, the Smithsonian says it has implanted these tiny Bluetooth heart monitors in eight species around the world, including giant anteaters in South America.</p>
<p>Tim Laske, a biologist who studies bears, is also the vice president of research at Medtronic — the world's largest medical device company — which donates the technology. The heart monitors are designed for humans, but Laske realized expired devices still had many years of life in them and could help with our understanding of animals.</p><p>"We've implanted more than 600 over the years. And these are all devices that would otherwise have been disposed of," Laske said.</p><p>Because of these monitors, scientists can now use data to assess which captive maned wolves, for example, have the best temperament to thrive in the wild or when a pack of scimitar-horned oryx out in the wild is stressed by humans encroaching on their habitat.  </p><p>For Moraes, the ability to visualize data in animals that was previously hidden excites her the most about the technology, offering powerful insights on a planet where our own activities are rapidly pushing beloved species closer to extinction.   </p>

<div class="article-title">Stalemate in Congress puts ACA subsidies, and millions of Americans, at risk</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Des Moines, Iowa</em> — Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill <span class="link">remained at a standstill</span> Thursday over how to reopen the government. Democrats claim they won't budge until <span class="link">health insurance subsidies</span> due to expire at the end of 2025 are extended, while Republicans are calling on Democrats to reopen the government, and then they will discuss the issue.</p><p>For Lori Hunt of Des Moines, Iowa, the debate isn't just numbers; it's about her ability to stay healthy and alive.</p><p>Hunt says she "couldn't afford" health insurance without the subsidies she receives through the Affordable Care Act. </p><p>"I'd have to cancel my insurance," Hunt told CBS News, joking that her insurance would consist of "thoughts and prayers." </p><p>"That's pretty much it, that's all I have," she adds. </p>
<p>Hunt survived breast cancer three years ago and was laid off from her job earlier this year. Without the federal help, she says her ACA premium would jump to about $700 per month.</p><p>"It would be more than my mortgage payment," Hunt said. </p><p>The tax credits were authorized under <span class="link">the American Rescue Plan Act</span> in 2021. The number of people who enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans doubled from 11 million in 2020 to more than 24 million in 2025, largely because of those subsidies, according to KFF Health News. </p><p>The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 3.8 million Americans won't be able to afford health insurance without the tax credits by 2035, including two million by next year. Without the credit, the average ACA premium would double by about 114%, KFF Health News says.    "When people lose health insurance, it can mean significant financial debt," said Sabrina Corlette, director for the Center for Health Insurance Reform at Georgetown University. "...It also means that people are waiting to the last minute to get necessary care, often ending up in our emergency rooms."</p>
<p>Corlette also says insurance companies will likely raise prices to cover the costs for the uninsured.</p><p>"The people affected will come from red states, they'll come from blue states," Corlette said. "...The folks who will be hit the hardest are in about 10 red states that have not expanded the Medicaid program."</p><p>Hunt says she has reached out to lawmakers for help and hopes that they can work together.  </p><p> "Why can't we just figure this out?" Hunt asks.</p><p> Corlette emphasized the ACA marketplaces are a safety net as more Americans move to gig work.  Health care advocacy groups told CBS News those under the ACA will probably be notified in the next few weeks whether their premium will increase. </p><p>"It's for entrepreneurs, it's for freelancers," she said. "It's for gig economy workers who are driving Ubers, or are doing Taskrabbit. So these are folks who are contributing to our economy."</p>

<div class="article-title">Robert Roberson granted stay of execution</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals halted the execution of Robert Roberson on Thursday morning.</p><p>The order was issued one week before <span class="link">Roberson's execution</span> was scheduled at the Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville. Roberson was sentenced to death after he was convicted of capital murder in the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki.</p><p>Roberson's defense contends that he has spent 22 years on death row as an innocent man. </p><p>His legal team has argued that Nikki was misdiagnosed with shaken baby syndrome. Testimony from medical experts cited by the defense suggests that the child died from severe viral and bacterial pneumonia, exacerbated by prescribed dangerous medications, rather than abuse.</p><p>"Robert adored Nikki, whose death was a tragedy, a horror compounded by Robert's wrongful conviction that devastated his whole family. We are confident that an objective review of the science and medical evidence will show there was no crime," Roberson's attorney Gretchen Sween said in a statement.</p>
<h2>Texas "junk science" law </h2><p>The Court of Criminal Appeals ruling from Thursday morning orders the trial court to weigh Roberson's arguments for overturning his conviction in line with what is known as <span class="link">Texas' junk science law</span>, and in light of the case of Andrew Roark.</p><p>The 2013 law allows a person convicted of a crime to seek relief if the evidence used against them is no longer credible.</p><p>"Robert lives to fight another day, and that really is a triumph," Sween said. "Many other things, such as infections like pneumonia, genetic disorders, etc., all can cause these same symptoms."   </p><p>Roark was convicted of injury to a child in 2000 and sentenced to 35 years in prison based on a shaken baby syndrome diagnosis. Last year, the Court of Criminal Appeals sent Roark's case back to the trial court due to the new research surrounding shaken baby syndrome. The next month, the Dallas County District Attorney exonerated Roark. </p>
<p>Since 1992, at least 40 parents and caregivers have been exonerated after wrongful shaken baby convictions, according to Roberson's defense team.   </p><p>New expert opinions found the shaken baby diagnosis unsound and asserted that the autopsy ruling the child's death a homicide was flawed, his legal team said. They claim that police and prosecutors rushed to judgment, leading to his wrongful conviction under the discredited shaken baby syndrome hypothesis.</p><h2>A series of delayed executions</h2><p>Since his first execution date more than nine years ago, Roberson's lawyers have filed multiple petitions with state and federal appeals courts, as well as with the U.S. Supreme Court, to try and stop his execution. Over the years, they have also asked the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and Gov. Greg Abbott to stop his lethal injection, as part of their efforts to get Roberson a new trial.  </p><p>After all of those avenues were exhausted, Roberson was <span class="link">scheduled to be executed</span> in October of 2024. But in an unusual move, a bipartisan group of legislators on state House Criminal Justice Committee issued a subpoena for Roberson to testify in a hearing, The state supreme court upheld the subpoena, and the warrant for Roberson's execution expired at midnight the next day.</p><p>The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, as well as some medical experts and other family members of Nikki, maintain the girl died because of child abuse and that Roberson had a history of hitting his daughter.</p><p>Ellis County State Representative Brian Harrison spoke out in support of the court's decision.</p><p>"I believe it is a matter of documented, unambiguous, unassailable fact that for over two decades, Mr. Robert Roberson has never, not once, been afforded due process and he has never had a fair trial," Harrison said.</p>
<h2>Roberson's legal team argues previously unrecognized autism </h2><p>Sween said Roberson had undiagnosed autism at the time of his conviction.</p><p>"We had disability rights groups, particularly in the autism community, who recognized how unfairly Robert had been treated based on symptoms of his then-unrecognized autism," Sween said.</p><p>Autism Society of Texas executive director Jacquie Benestante said she hopes Roberson's case sets a precedent in the future.</p><p>"We hope that this leads to a better understanding of failures that people with developmental disabilities face when they're in the criminal justice system."</p><p>Roberson's case is far from over.</p><p>"Robert has not yet been awarded a new trial. What he's been awarded is the right to go back to the trial court level and try to demonstrate before that court that he, too, should be granted a new trial," Sween said.</p><p>Joshua Burns was convicted of shaken baby syndrome, which was ultimately overturned.</p>
<p>"I know that there's so much more work to be done for Robert, to get this new trial and to get this underway," Burns said. "I am just hoping and praying that we can see Robert come home, and we can see Robert exonerated and declared innocent."</p><p>CBS News Texas reached out to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office for comment on the court's decision.</p>

<p>Former NBA star Paul Pierce was arrested on suspicion of DUI after he was found asleep behind the wheel on the 101 Freeway in Los Angeles on Tuesday, police said. </p><p>California Highway Patrol officers said that several lanes of the freeway were closed while they were investigating an unrelated multi-car crash that happened just south of Lankershim Boulevard at around 10:34 p.m.</p><p>"As traffic lanes reopened, officers saw a Range Rover SUV stopped in traffic lanes south of the crash scene," said a news release from CHP.

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo Thursday launching a task force to improve living conditions in barracks across the military. In the memo, he wrote, "Quality of life for our Warriors is a critical component to reviving our warrior ethos and rebuilding our military."</p><p>He's giving the task force 30 days to deliver a barracks improvement plan. </p><p>The defense secretary announced the task force earlier this week in a visit to Naval Air Station Oceana. </p><p>"It is simply unacceptable that in some cases, our warriors continue to live in substandard housing. Every warfighter of our joint force deserves housing that is clean, comfortable, and safe," Hegseth said. </p><p>He referenced a 2023 Government Accountability Report that included pictures of the filthy conditions at some of the barracks and said "poor living conditions undermine quality of life and readiness" of the U.S. military.</p>
<p>It was that report that led Rob Evans, an Army veteran, to create the app Hots&amp;Cots to allow service members to anonymously rate and post photos of the conditions in their barracks. </p><p>"There are some great installations to be at and there are ones you don't necessarily wanna be at," Evans said in an interview with CBS News. "And you know, there's no tools to understand what those conditions are like. And that was the driving force of creating Hots&amp;Cots." </p><p>As for what service members expect of the task force, Evans said that "it's more than just the mold and like the HVAC — those are the issues, but it's also the system in and of itself is broken. They don't trust the system."</p><p>Hots&amp;Cots received a call from a member of the Barracks Task Force to see how the app's mission could fit into the effort to improve living conditions for the military, according to a post on the Hots&amp;Cots X account Thursday. </p>
<p>Addressing concerns about conditions in barracks has been a problem plaguing several administrations. The GAO report found the Defense Department's budget placesbarracks low on the list of its priorities and says they "are chronically neglected and experience increased deterioration." </p>
<p>The Trump administration earlier this year diverted money from barrack construction to the southwest border mission, according to reporting from Military.com. The reconciliation bill passed over the summer includes about $1 billion for construction across the military branches.  </p><p><span class="link">CBS News reported in 2022 </span>on mold-infested barracks at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, that forced the temporary relocation of over 1,100 soldiers. Since then, the Army has demolished many of the barracks and upgraded those remaining to make them suitable for unaccompanied soldiers to live in. </p><p>Soldiers who participated in a survey for tenants in unaccompanied housing are overall not satisfied with barracks conditions. The survey had a small response rate, but it was the first time the annual tenant survey included a section for unaccompanied soldiers to rate barracks. </p><p>Out of 715 unaccompanied housing buildings that had surveys returned, 43% of buildings rated in the "Outstanding," "Very Good," "Good," "Average" for overall satisfaction, while a majority, 58% of buildings rated "below average" or lower.</p><p>One soldier who lives in barracks on an Army installation in a southern state told CBS News that if the Pentagon follows through on the task force, it "will probably be the best people-first initiative that the Army has ever seen since I've been in the Army."</p><p>"I'm really hoping that this is not the same thing where it's, hey, we are going to say that we're gonna throw a bunch of money at this, we're gonna say that we're gonna take this seriously, but then we're gonna kick this can down the road for a later time," the soldier said. </p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Dominion Voting Systems, one of the nation's largest election technology companies, has been acquired by St. Louis-based Liberty Vote. The acquisition caps a half-decade that saw Dominion thrust into the public eye amid false accusations of election rigging.</p><p>Liberty Vote announced the purchase of Dominion Thursday afternoon. The terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed.</p><p>Liberty Vote was founded by Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican elections director for St. Louis. He also founded KNOWiNK, which describes itself as the largest provider of electronic poll book technology in the United States, used in dozens of states. KNOWiNK says it was built "exclusively in America" and has a bipartisan team of former elections administrators, directors and poll workers, according to a company spokesperson.</p><p>In a statement Thursday, Liberty Vote said it would be "100% AMERICAN OWNED," and that "as of today, Dominion is gone." Dominion was incorporated in Toronto but in 2009, it moved its headquarters to Denver.</p><p>"Liberty Vote signals a new chapter for American elections—one where trust is rebuilt from the ground up," Leiendecker said. "Liberty Vote is committed to delivering election technology that prioritizes paper-based transparency, security, and simplicity so that voters can be assured that every ballot is filled-in accurately and fairly counted."</p>
<p>The acquisition marks a significant development in the U.S. election technology industry, bringing together two major players that would provide key infrastructure for voting and voter verification systems across dozens of states ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p><p>Dominion provided voting systems in key battlegrounds such as <span class="link">Georgia</span> — a state Biden narrowly won — which became the catalyst for unfounded narratives against Dominion that also led to harassment and threats against election officials in states where they utilized the company's voting tabulation systems. Dominion spent years fending off claims from President Trump and his allies, who alleged that the company's machines were manipulated to favor Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. </p><p>The fallout from those claims led to a series of high-profile defamation lawsuits. In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay nearly $800 million to <span class="link">settle</span> Dominion's suit, while <span class="link">Newsmax</span> settled for $67 million. The company alleged Fox broadcasted unsubstantiated allegations that Dominion's software manipulated vote counts. Dominion's lawsuit highlighted 20 such statements aired on a slew of shows on the network.</p><p>Dominion also filed separate cases against Trump allies, including a $1.3 billion <span class="link">lawsuit</span> against Rudy Giuliani, which ended in September with an undisclosed settlement. Giuliani was a leading figure in the effort to overturn Mr. Trump's defeat. The terms of the settlement were not made public.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A federal judge in New York tossed out a defamation lawsuit that Drake brought against Universal Music Group, ruling that lyrics branding the superstar as a pedophile in Kendrick Lamar's Grammy-winning diss track "Not Like Us" were opinion.</p><p>Judge Jeannette A. Vargas on Thursday  rejected the suit in a written opinion that began by citing "the vitriolic war of words" and saying the case arose "from perhaps the most infamous rap battle in the genre's history."</p><p>Filed in January, the lawsuit alleged that UMG published and promoted "Not Like Us" even though it included false pedophilia allegations against Drake and suggested listeners should resort to vigilante justice.</p><p>The lawsuit also alleged that the track tarnished his reputation and decreased the value of his brand.</p><p>Lamar was not named in the lawsuit.  </p>
<p>Universal Music Group, the parent record label for both artists, had denied the allegations.</p><p>"From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day," a UMG spokesperson told CBS News in a statement Thursday. "We're pleased with the court's dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake's music and investing in his career."</p><p>A spokesperson for Drake told CBS News in a statement, "We intend to appeal today's ruling, and we look forward to the Court of Appeals reviewing it."</p><p>CBS News has also reached out to representatives for Lamar for comment.</p>
<p>UMG owns both Interscope, Lamar's label, and Republic Records, where Drake has spent his entire career. </p><p>In February, Drake <span class="link">reached a settlement</span> with iHeartMedia in a separate court complaint filed in Texas over "Not Like Us."</p><p>In that complaint, Drake alleged that iHeartMedia had received illegal payments from UMG to boost radio airplay for "Not Like Us." iHeartMedia and UMG denied the allegations. </p><p>And in November 2024, Drake <span class="link">also filed</span> a similar complaint in New York against streaming giant Spotify and UMG, accusing them of conspiring to inflate streams of "Not Like Us." Both companies have also denied those claims.</p><p>Lamar and Drake <span class="link">have been beefing for years</span>, with the two rappers releasing several diss tracks about one another. The feud appeared to reach its height when Lamar called out Drake during his <span class="link">Super Bowl Halftime Show</span> in February. </p><p>In "Not Like Us," which was released in May 2024, Lamar makes disturbing accusations about Drake allegedly having inappropriate conduct with minors. He also makes similar allegations about Drake's friends and continues to question Drake's talent.</p><p>In his own responding diss track, Drake denied these allegations, as well as allegations about having a daughter. </p>

<p>Attorney General Letitia James, New York's top prosecutor, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia. </p><p>James faces one charge of bank fraud and another of making false statements to a financial institution.

<div class="article-title">Bill Belichick "fully committed" to North Carolina amid buyout rumors</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>With rumors and reports swirling that Bill Belichick's time at the University of North Carolina could be coming to an abrupt end, the head coach and the school have released a joint statement saying they remain committed to each other.</p><p>It was reported Wednesday that Belichick, the former New England Patriots legendary head coach, and North Carolina, have already discussed potential buyout options for the head coach, and he could be off the job within the next few weeks. Belichick has even shown a willingness to "trigger his own $1 million if he can find a soft landing with another team or in media," according to UNC insider Ollie Connolly. </p>
<p>Connolly also reported that UNC has already uncovered recruiting and practice violations by Belichick and his staff, which could lead to the head coach being fired for cause and not receive his full buyout from the university. It seemed like a parting of the ways was immanent throughout much of the day on Wednesday. </p><p>But Belichick and UNC athletic director Bubba Cunningham released a concise joint statement pushing back at an impending divorce late Wednesday evening.</p><p>"I am fully committed to the UNC program and what we're building here," Belichick said in a statement. </p>
<p> "Coach Belichick has the full support of the Department of Athletics and University," said Cunningham. </p>
<h2>Bill Belichick's first season at UNC</h2><p>The Tar Heels fell to 2-3 on the season after a 38-10 loss to Clemson last Saturday. It was UNC's second straight blowout loss and the third time they've lost by at least 25 points this season. </p><p>But the issues at UNC go beyond the football field. </p><p>A report from WRAL on Monday painted the picture of a dysfunctional staff in Chapel Hill. While Belichick has been praised for his one-on-one coaching, his ability to run a program is being questioned by players and their families. </p>
<p>Complaints range from a lack of communication between the coaching staff and families, and the lack of college experience from Belichick's staffers. Students who transferred when Belichick took the job are also getting preferential treatment -- extra tickets, better parking spots -- over those who remained from the Mack Brown era, which has created a divide in the locker room.</p><p>"It's an unstructured mess," one source told WRAL. "There's no culture, no organization. It's a complete disaster."</p><p>Players and parents also weren't thrilled to hear that <span class="link">Belichick has banned the Patriots from UNC</span>. Considering Belichick's big selling point was to prepare UNC players for the NFL, restricting one of just 32 options at the next level has backfired on the head coach.</p><p>Rumors of the school potentially looking to move on from Belichick reportedly stem from a rules violation from one of Belichick's staffers. UNC cornerbacks coach Armond Hawkins was reportedly suspended this week for giving extra benefits to the families of Tar Heels players, via The Athletic. </p><p>Despite the issues on the field and the problems in the locker room, UNC is seemingly preaching some patience with Belichick in his first year as a college head coach. He's clearly trying to integrate some of the elements that made him one of greatest NFL coaches to the college game, but is finding out that's not how things work in college football.</p><p>Belichick signed a five-year, $50 million contract to become the head coach of the Tar Heels. Only the first three years of the contract are guaranteed, per USA Today. </p><p>While it seemed like Belichick's time at UNC could be coming to a quick end Wednesday evening, the school and the head coach say they remain committed to each other and are working hard to turn around the Tar Heels football program.</p>
<p>The University of North Carolina is off this weekend and will play its next game Oct. 17 at Cal. </p>

<div class="article-title">Peru's Congress removes President Boluarte as a crime wave grips the country</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>LIMA, Peru — Peru's Congress voted early Friday to remove deeply unpopular President Dina Boluarte from office as a crime wave grips the South American nation.</p> <p>Lawmakers had set up a debate and impeachment trial late Thursday in the 130-member unicameral Congress after voting to accept four requests for a vote to remove Boluarte from office over what they said was her government's inability to stem crime.</p> <p>They requested that Boluarte come before them shortly before midnight to defend herself, but when she did not appear they immediately voted to oust her. In short order, 124 lawmakers voted just past midnight to impeach Boluarte. There were no votes against the effort.</p>
<p>The shocking turn of events came just hours after a shooting at a concert in the capital inflamed anger over crime roiling the country.</p> <p>Unlike eight previous attempts to remove her, almost all legislative factions expressed support for the latest requests.</p> <p>Boluarte took office in December 2022 after Parliament used the same mechanism to impeach her predecessor.</p> <p>The constitution calls for the president of the Congress to be next in the line of succession, but it was not immediately clear if it would be the body's current leader or if lawmakers would select another among them.</p> <p>Peru's first female president was its sixth leader in just under a decade. A normal presidential term is five years. Her term had been scheduled to end July 28, 2026 and elections had been scheduled for next April.</p>
<p>Boluarte assumed power in Peru in 2022 to complete the term of then-President Pedro Castillo, who was removed from office just two years into his five-year term after attempting to dissolve the legislature to avoid his own removal. She had served as Castillo's vice president before becoming president.</p> <p>There were more than 500 protests demanding her resignation in the first three months of her presidency.</p> <p>Plagued by scandals, her administration's inability to address Peru's incessant crime proved to be her undoing.</p> <p>On Wednesday, she partially blamed the situation on immigrants living in the country illegally.</p>
<p>"This crime has been brewing for decades and has been strengthened by illegal immigration, which past administrations haven't defeated," she said during a military ceremony. "Instead, they've opened the doors of our borders and allowed criminals to enter everywhere... without any restrictions."</p> <p>Official figures show that 6,041 people were killed between January and mid-August, the highest number during the same period since 2017. Meanwhile, extortion complaints totaled 15,989 between January and July, a 28% increase compared to the same period in 2024.</p> <p>The country's latest presidential crisis erupted after a man opened fire and injured five people Wednesday during a concert of Peru's most popular cumbia groups, Agua Marina.</p> <p>Prime Minister Eduardo Arana on Thursday defended Boluarte during a crime-focused hearing before Parliament, but it was not enough to dissuade lawmakers from pursuing the motions to see the president out of office.</p> <p>"Parliament's concerns are not resolved by addressing a request for impeachment, much less by approving it," Arana told lawmakers. "We are not clinging to our positions. We are here, and we knew from the beginning that our first day here could also be our last day in office."</p>

<div class="article-title">White House claims "more than 1,000%" rise in assaults on ICE agents, data says otherwise</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Immigration and Customs and Enforcement officials have claimed since June that assaults on their own officers have climbed sharply, with the White House insisting in a September executive order that attacks are up "more than 1,000 percent."</p> <p>While the number of assaults on ICE agents have increased, there is no public evidence that they have spiked as dramatically as the federal government has claimed.</p> <p>An analysis of court records shows about a 25 percent rise in charges for assault against federal officers through mid-September, compared to the same period a year ago.</p> <p>Undisputably, ICE agents have at times faced increasingly dangerous work conditions and assaults around the nation, including some that could have turned deadly.</p>
<p>The agency promises that every person who assaults an ICE agent "will face the full extent of the law," according to an executive order signed by President Trump.</p> <p>But Colorado Public Radio's search of federal court records for charges of assault on a federal officer over the last five years found no evidence for a rise in assaults on the scale the White House claims.</p> <p>Despite repeated requests for data to back up their eye-popping statistics, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly declined to provide any justification to CPR or NPR for continuing to make its claims.</p> <p>Going back five years, CPR News found that while the number of assaults on federal officers has risen, it has grown at nowhere near the rate claimed by the federal government.</p> <p>ICE is under pressure to find and remove millions of people from the country who are here without legal status. As operations and protests have increased, it's not surprising that the number of charges for assault against federal agents have climbed at least 25% this year - with increased confrontations between them and protesters in Los Angeles and Chicago. It can take weeks for charges to be filed, so the latest number may not reflect the total number of assaults that have occurred recently.</p>
<p><strong>Recent alleged assaults on ICE agents</strong></p> <p>Fifteen people were charged this summer after what authorities called a July 4 plot to lure ICE agents out of an Alvarado, Texas detention center, where they were then fired upon. A civilian police officer was wounded. In other cases, criminal affidavits show that Customs and Border Protection officers have been punched on patrol. Another ICE agent in California said he was dragged by a car. In Omaha, an ICE agent was slammed to the ground during an arrest and had to be hospitalized. Last month, a sniper opened fire on an ICE detention center in Texas, killing two detainees, though federal officials believe immigration agents were his target.</p> <p>But even taking into account those serious incidents, together they still don't come anywhere close to the administration's claim of a 1,000 percent increase in assaults over just a few months. </p> <p>Former FBI agent and leader Bob Pence said that when law enforcement officers engage in hype or make outright misleading statements, it jeopardizes trust in the criminal justice system.</p> <p>Pence, a 30-year veteran of the Federal Bureau of Investigation wrote a book published in 2020, "My Non-Political FBI: From Hoover to a Violent America."</p> <p>To Pence, exaggerating claims of assault on ICE officers has a cost.</p> <p>"There are a number of ramifications, if the public can't believe what law enforcement is saying then law enforcement probably can't depend on the cooperation of citizens to report information to them accurately," he said.</p> <p>Nationwide, charges of assault on all federal officers across all agencies didn't start to rise until recently.</p> <p>In the last three months, case filings of assaults on all police officers nationwide jumped 74 percent from the previous quarter, CPR's analysis shows. Most of that increase can be attributed to clashes in Los Angeles, where ICE has engaged in large-scale enforcement operations since June. </p>
<p>Those incidents have led to protests throughout that city. But those, and others nationally, have also provided indications that the public broadly is beginning to question the credibility of some of the federal government's claims.</p> <p>A man in Washington, D.C., in August threw a ham sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent and was charged with assaulting a federal officer. But prosecutors, a couple of weeks later, failed to get a grand jury to indict him.</p> <p>In Los Angeles, federal prosecutors attempted to get felony indictments against at least 38 people involved in those protests and civil unrest or near immigration raids. They persuaded citizens to indict their neighbors just seven times, according to local reporting. Other charges were dismissed, reduced to misdemeanors or resolved by plea deals.</p> <p>For Homeland Security and ICE claims of a 1,000 percent increase in assaults to be true, there would also have to be thousands of other assaults that did not result in criminal charges. This despite the government's claim that all assaults on federal agents will be prosecuted.</p> <p>But requests for any data kept by that agency were denied, with a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security declining to cite the source of that data or the methodology used to arrive at the 1,000 percent increase announced it in August.</p> <p>They did send one email with six links to previously issued press releases, again citing a 1,000 percent increase in assaults without explanation. Later, DHS sent an email with press releases for 12 cases of assault on agents.</p> <p>Even in cases where video does clearly show an assault — though perhaps not as dramatically as ICE claims — it is no guarantee that the case will result in a conviction.</p> <p>Take the case of Venezuelan Abraham Gonzalez-Romero.</p> <p>Gonzalez-Romero's initial Colorado criminal cases were shaky. State prosecutors charged him with attempted murder with little evidence except that he was in possession of a firearm at a scene where shots were fired. The only witnesses to the case were also in the country without authorization and had credibility problems.</p>
<p>The local charges were eventually dismissed.</p> <p>On Feb. 28, ICE agents were waiting for him as he left the Denver County jail, having been notified of his pending release by the Denver Sheriff after ICE asked about him. They flashed their badges and began walking towards him, he ran and was captured on jail video knocking an immigration agent to the ground.</p> <p>It was a minor skirmish with no injuries. But that didn't stop his case from entering the national immigration debate.</p> <p>Just a week later, House Republicans hosted a panel of big-city mayors, including from Denver, Chicago and Boston, to talk about so-called sanctuary policies.</p> <p>Colorado Republican Rep. Jeff Crank told the story about Gonzalez-Romero, but he went far beyond the ICE agent's account.</p> <p>"In Denver, you require that the Denver Police Department release Tren de Aragua gang members into the streets, uncuffed," Crank said, animated as he addressed Denver Mayor Mike Johnston in the House hearing. "Just last week, it resulted in an illegal Tren de Aragua member assaulting and biting — and biting! — an ICE agent … You're putting police officers at risk to score political points and it's outrageous."</p> <p>But in court, federal prosecutors made no effort to prove Gonzalez-Romero bit, or even attempted to bite, an agent and his attorney said it never happened. Federal public defender Kelly Christl also said in court, "there's no evidence to support that" he was a Tren de Aragua gang member. Crank's office did not respond to questions about where he got his information about the bite.</p> <p>Then, despite the promise that all assaults on ICE agents would be prosecuted to the fullest extent, the government dropped the charge of assault on an officer in a plea deal. Gonzalez-Romero was sentenced to time served on a gun charge, but remains in ICE custody in Denver.</p>
<p><strong>A former ICE agent's perspective</strong></p> <p>Scott Mechkowski, a former Deputy Field Office Director for ICE in New York City, said the court filings will never fully reflect the frequency of assaults on immigration agents.</p> <p>"The way it's presented and prosecuted in federal court is different for us," he said. "Like we were told — most of the time our guys got bit or they got punched — and we were told (by federal prosecutors) that's part of the job."</p> <p>Mechkowski said the only people who fully collect the number of assaults on ICE officers is ICE.</p> <p><strong>Other federal jobs more perilous, according to charges filed</strong></p> <p>While not backing up the enormous increases in assaults claimed by ICE and Homeland Security leaders, the federal data does make one thing clear: At least in Colorado, in recent years it has been far more dangerous to be an employee with the federal Bureau of Prisons or the Bureau of Indian Affairs than an ICE agent.</p> <p>Between 2015 and June 2025, the the largest number of assaults on federal officers in Colorado took place on Indian Country land and in the state's federal prisons.</p> <p>But Denver immigration attorney Christine Hernandez said that in cases where federal officials exaggerate statistics or agents distort facts, there is a credibility cost for federal law enforcement.</p> <p>Just this year, she has represented people where judges ask for evidence on links to gang affiliations and other stated facts and the prosecutors can't furnish it.</p> <p>"We've never seen this before," Hernandez said. "You don't know what the government is going to say. A lot of times, they don't have evidence, they don't present evidence to back up the charging document. You're supposed to have your evidence in place. That's their job. And it's not happening."<br/></p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Dominion Voting Systems, the company at the center of false fraud claims about the 2020 election, has been acquired by an entity called Liberty Vote.</p> <p>"As of today, Dominion is gone," the company said in a press release Thursday. "Liberty Vote assumes full ownership and operational control." Dominion's website now redirects to libertyvote.com.</p> <p>President Trump and his allies, including Rudy Giuliani, have falsely blamed Dominion and its machines for rigging the 2020 election, taking votes from Trump. The baseless claims against Dominion caused one of its executives to go into hiding in 2020, and led to numerous defamation lawsuits. </p>
<p>Giuliani recently reached a confidential settlement with Dominion. Most notably, Dominion won a nearly $800 million defamation case against Fox News.</p> <p>Earlier this year, an official with Trump's Justice Department reached out to county clerks in Missouri and asked to inspect Dominion voting equipment they used in 2020.</p> <p>The Liberty Vote release makes a couple of nods to conservative election priorities, including calling the acquisition "a bold and historic move to transform and improve election integrity in America." Conservatives in recent years have used the phrase "election integrity" and talked about increasing faith in the nation's voting systems.</p>
<p>The release also notes that one of Liberty Vote's priorities is "[l]everaging hand-marked paper ballots enabling compliance with President Trump's executive order, and ensuring election security and compliance with federal standards."</p> <p>Most U.S. voters already vote using hand-marked paper ballots. Much of Trump's March executive order on voting has been halted by federal judges.</p> <p>The new company is founded by Scott Leiendecker, a onetime St. Louis Republican election director who founded an election technology company that's broadly used by election officials.</p>

<div class="article-title">Justice Department indicts Letitia James after pressure from Trump</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A federal grand jury in Virginia has indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James on one count of bank fraud and one count of making a false statement to a financial institution — charges that come after steady pressure from President Trump to prosecute one of his longtime political foes.</p> <p>James, a Democrat who pledged to investigate Trump during her campaign, eventually sued Trump and his company for inflating the value of some of its properties, winning more than $450 million in the civil business fraud case. The financial penalty was later thrown out on appeal. </p> <p>At one of his own campaign rallies last year, Trump called for both James and the judge in that case to "be arrested and punished accordingly." The president has been persistent in his calls since taking office, writing "JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED" in a post on TruthSocial last month that was directed at Attorney General Pam Bondi. </p>
<p>Thursday's indictment accuses James of lying on her application for a $109,600 mortgage to buy a property in Norfolk, Va. in 2020, alleging she promised her financial lenders it would be a secondary property for her personal use — but that she instead rented it out. The government says she benefited from "ill-gotten gains" of $18,933 from favorable terms including a lower borrowing rate and a higher seller credit.</p> <p>In a video posted to social media, James denied the charges as "baseless" and criticized the president's actions as a "grave violation of our Constitutional order."  </p> <p>"This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system," James said. "He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State Attorney General." </p> <p>Federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia spent months on the case this year. A Republican career prosecutor there determined there was not enough evidence to bring a case against James. Then he was forced out of his job by the White House, only to be replaced by Lindsey Halligan, a former insurance lawyer in Florida with no experience as a prosecutor.</p> <p>"No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust," Halligan said in a statement. "The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served."</p>
<p>Last month, Halligan secured an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, who has pleaded not guilty to two felony charges.</p> <p>The charges for James have been pushed in part by Ed Martin, the weaponization czar inside the Justice Department who traveled to Brooklyn to stand outside one of James's properties, where he was photographed by <em>The New York Post</em>. </p> <p>Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for James, has criticized Martin for targeting Democratic lawmakers and other figures to settle scores for Trump. </p> <p>"We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge," Lowell said in a statement on Thursday. "When a President can publicly direct charges to be filed against someone — when it was reported that career attorneys concluded none were warranted — it marks a serious attack on the rule of law. We will fight these charges in every process allowed in the law."</p> <p>James is scheduled for an initial court appearance on October 24. </p>

<p>A ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war could formally take effect today, and Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners could start going home as soon as this weekend.</p>

<div aria-label="Transcript" class="transcript storytext">
<b class="icn-story-transcript-wrap">
</b>
<p>(CHEERING)</p><p>SCOTT DETROW, HOST: </p><p> Today, Israelis in Tel Aviv celebrated the announcement of a ceasefire deal in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners may start going home within a few days. And after two years, the most deadly war ever between Israelis and Palestinians may soon be over. For the latest, we are joined by NPR's Greg Myre in Tel Aviv. Hi, Greg.</p><p>GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Hi, Scott.</p><p>DETROW: A lot of moving parts to this ceasefire deal. What is happening now, and what would happen after that?</p><p>MYRE: Yeah. Israel's government is holding a late-night meeting. It's expected to approve the ceasefire deal, and when it does, it will take effect 24 hours after the vote. Now, this also starts the clock ticking for Israel to start pulling back troops, but it will still have about half of Gaza under its control during this first phase. Now, the clock will be ticking for Hamas, as well. It needs to get the Israeli hostages ready for release. There are believed to be 20 living hostages, 28 dead hostages. President Trump said today this could happen on Monday or Tuesday.</p><p>Meanwhile, Israel is to start releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Now, this will likely take many, many days. And on top of all this, Scott, Trump is expected to visit the region over the weekend. This would include a stop in Israel, where he's been invited to speak to the Israeli parliament, and possibly Egypt, where the negotiations for the ceasefire took place. So a very busy few days coming up.</p><p>DETROW: But Greg, we have had ceasefires in this war before, and they broke down pretty quickly. So why is this one different so far?</p><p>MYRE: Well, Trump put a lot more pressure on the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, more than he did when there was a ceasefire in January that collapsed, much more than President Biden did during his final year in office. Trump got Netanyahu to agree publicly to this deal, and then they put the pressure on Hamas. There was a lot of international support, particularly from Arab states like Egypt and Qatar, who work with Hamas. And the Israeli and Palestinian publics were just exhausted. There are strong majorities on both sides who wanted this war to end. So lots of hard days ahead and plenty could go wrong, but there's a lot more momentum and a lot more leaders invested in making this work.</p><p>DETROW: I want to go back to something you said a few moments ago, though. The war may be ending, but you mentioned Israeli troops will still be in Gaza. How long are they expected to stay?</p><p>MYRE: Scott, there's no clear timeline. Israel has agreed to pull back in phases. It will initially move out of places like Gaza City and other Palestinian population centers. Now, they're eventually supposed to retreat to a buffer zone along the Gaza border but still on the Gaza side of the border. Hamas had always demanded a full withdrawal of Israeli troops, but they just didn't have the leverage in these negotiations. With Israeli troops in Gaza, it wouldn't take much to restart hostilities. And just a final note, the ceasefire isn't yet formally in effect, and Israel did carry out a number of airstrikes today saying its forces came under threat.</p><p>DETROW: One big question that people have been asking for years, really - who would rule Gaza going forward?</p><p>MYRE: Yeah. That is a huge question. Trump's plan, as outlined last week, says Hamas, which has ruled there for almost 20 years, is supposed to step aside, but they haven't publicly agreed to do that. It's - the plan calls for Palestinian technocrats to take over, at least temporarily, but no one knows exactly who these people are, what authority they would have, how long they'd be there. And on top of this, there's supposed to be a committee - a Gaza committee - that Trump and the former British prime minister, Tony Blair, would head as a so-called board of peace. But they wouldn't be involved in the day-to-day running of Gaza, and it's not clear how they would address problems that might crop up.</p><p>DETROW: That is NPR's Greg Myre joining us from Tel Aviv. Thank you so much.</p><p>MYRE: Sure thing, Scott.</p>

<div class="article-title">Once the Gaza ceasefire goes into effect, what happens next? Here's what to know</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement for the "first phase" of a plan promoted by President Donald Trump to end the devastating conflict in Gaza.</p> <p>The initiative begins with a ceasefire that is expected to go into effect after Israel's Cabinet votes on the truce agreement reached with Hamas following indirect talks in the Egyptian beach resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. That Cabinet vote to approve the deal is expected Thursday.</p>
<p>Here is what to expect after the Israeli Cabinet approves the deal, according to a person briefed by Egyptian officials close to the talks who was not authorized to speak publicly. NPR has also seen a copy of the agreement that the Israeli Cabinet is voting on.</p> <ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"><li>On Thursday night or Friday, a ceasefire goes into effect. (It must begin within 24 hours of Israeli Cabinet approval).<br/></li><li>Also Thursday night or Friday, within 24 hours of Israel cabinet approval, Israel begins pulling back its troops from parts of Gaza to an agreed line.</li></ul><ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"><li>After the 24-hour period, Hamas then has 72 hours to free the 20 hostages that are still alive. President Trump says this could happen on Monday or Tuesday. </li></ul><ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"><li>As the hostages are released, Israel begins freeing some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.</li></ul><ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"><li>A further 28 hostages are presumed dead and Hamas says recovering their bodies — some of which lie under the rubble of destroyed buildings — will take much more time.  </li></ul><ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"><li>By Monday, hundreds of trucks of humanitarian aid are expected to be allowed to enter Gaza. Tom Fletcher, the U.N. humanitarian chief, told reporters that officials have 170,000 metric tons of medicine, aid and other supplies ready for Gaza once they are given a green light.</li></ul>
<p>President Trump says he expects to visit the region and that the White House is "working on the timing." Trump says he plans to go to Egypt for an "official signing." He's also been invited to speak to the Israeli parliament.</p> <p>But this remains a delicate moment where much could still go awry. For example, Reuters reports that the list of Palestinian prisoners Israel will free is still being debated.</p> <p>Reaching a lasting peace may be harder still. The next phases of President Trump's 20-point plan require further negotiation on essential issues, including the fate of Hamas and who will rule Gaza when the fighting ends.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key points in the plan:</p> <ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"><li>It requires Gaza to be initially governed by a temporary committee of technocrats, including "qualified Palestinians and international experts" responsible for running public services in Gaza. It says this body will be supervised by a new international transitional body called "the Board of Peace," to be headed and chaired by Trump. </li></ul><ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"><li>Palestinians are to be allowed to remain in Gaza and "those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return." The plan says, "We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza."</li></ul><ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"><li>Hamas and allied factions give up any role in governing Gaza and agree to disarm, handing over weapons in a decommissioning process overseen by "independent" monitors.</li></ul><ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"><li>A temporary "International Stabilization Force" organized by the U.S. with Arab nations and other countries would "immediately deploy" in Gaza. The force would train "vetted Palestinian police forces" and act longer-term as an internal security force — and have a role in securing border areas with Israel and Egypt. </li></ul><ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"><li>Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. The Israeli military is expected to gradually withdraw completely from Gaza "save for a security perimeter presence."</li></ul><ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"><li>The plan includes a provision for creating a "credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people."<br/></li></ul>
<p>Hamas has repeatedly rejected Israel's call for it to disarm, and after the plan was announced, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said publicly that Israel has not agreed to a Palestinian state.</p>
<p>And President Trump's proposed "Board of Peace" has attracted controversy for giving a role to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Blair is widely reviled — especially in the Middle East for deciding that Britain should join the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Blair's think tank has also been criticized over leaked plans to turn Gaza into a "Trump Riviera."</p> <p>Getting both sides to agree to all these terms remains a complicated prospect. And even once a peace agreement is negotiated, applying a deal to the reality of a shattered Gaza — where entire areas have been reduced to rubble by airstrikes and bulldozers, and the population traumatized in a conflict that has forced the vast majority — will be a perhaps even bigger challenge.</p> <p><em>NPR's Aya Batrawy contributed to this report from Dubai.

<p>TONYA MOSLEY, HOST: </p><p> This is FRESH AIR. I'm Tonya Mosley.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)</p><p>TINA KOTEK: To put military troops in American cities is a threat to our democracy. If you think about the speech that the president gave to the hundreds of generals that were gathered a week or so ago to talk about training our troops in the cities of America, we're not at war with ourselves here. There is not an insurrection or a rebellion not only in Portland or Chicago or other places. Look, there are challenges. There's lawful demonstrations. Local law enforcement is handling the situation. And I think this is an overreaction to the situation, and it's just not true. Facts should matter.</p><p>MOSLEY: That was Oregon governor Tina Kotek on NPR reacting to President Donald Trump's order to deploy national guard troops into several U.S. cities. Her words capture the anxiety and disbelief reverberating through many city halls and state houses and even inside the Pentagon. In Portland, a federal judge has temporarily blocked the guard's arrival. In Chicago, city and state leaders are suing to stop similar deployments. But that resistance is falling largely along partisan lines. While Democratic governors oppose the deployments, some Republican governors are welcoming them. Louisiana governor Jeff Landry requested up to 1,000 troops for New Orleans and Shreveport and Baton Rouge, citing high crime rates. And at least six Republican-led states, including West Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio, have sent hundreds of guard troops to Washington, D.C., at Trump's request. But the deployment orders are just one part of a larger shift happening inside of the military itself. Last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivered what's being described as one of the most politicized military addresses in modern history.</p><p>Speaking to about 800 generals, admirals and senior leaders, Hegseth called for reshaping the armed forces around a warrior ethos and suggested the military must be ready for domestic urban operations. He rejected what he called woke weakness. My guest today is Nancy Youssef, a national security staff writer with The Atlantic. She's been reporting on the reaction inside the Pentagon to Hegseth's speech and what this moment means for civil military relations in America. Prior to joining The Atlantic, Youssef covered the military and the Arab world for The Wall Street Journal. Our interview was recorded yesterday.</p><p>Nancy Youssef, welcome to FRESH AIR.</p><p>NANCY YOUSSEF: Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>MOSLEY: Nancy, President Trump has been deploying National Guard troops from states like Texas to cities like Chicago and Portland and others. And these deployments, as we know, have faced legal challenges from federal judges and lawsuits from state officials. Can you bring us up to speed on where this stands and help us understand what's happening?</p><p>YOUSSEF: Sure. I should begin by describing sort of what the National Guard does and under what authority they can deploy. Most National Guard answer to governors, and their job is to respond to demands within that state under the authority of the governor. So you might think of it or seen it as National Guardsmen responding to natural disasters - hurricanes, tornadoes, other natural disasters within their state. They might get support from nearby states, but all of those guardsmen are under the deployment of a governor. And then there are instances where the National Guard can be federalized, which means that they are under the authority of the federal government. The most sort of common one that we would think of is when they are deployed overseas because they are needed to sort of supplement the active duty component. We saw this both in Iraq and Afghanistan. What the president is doing is he is federalizing troops in these cities over the objections of the governor. And so by doing so, he is limited in terms of where he can deploy them because the governor hasn't signed off on them. So they're going to federal buildings because that's under the federal government, and they are escorting ICE agents around on some missions.</p><p>MOSLEY: I want to ask you some questions about some of the rhetoric from the president's deputy chief of staff, Steven Miller, because I think we can't overstate some of the language being used. He is describing what's happening in Portland as a terrorist assault - an organized terrorist attack on federal officers. As you have said, many local leaders and governors are saying that's just not true. In Oregon, the Oregon governor actually says the protests are so small, they just span a city block. Tell me first what role Miller is playing here and what his rhetoric might tell us about where this could be heading.</p><p>YOUSSEF: Well, based on my reporting, I think he is someone who's a proponent of using military force in cities that he sees it as a necessity and that he believes that the president has wide authorities to deploy them into American cities because the threat as he sees them as domestic terrorists and he's described it widely, what constitutes a threat to the United States. What's interesting is not only the language that you pointed out, but in a tweet over the weekend, he said that the Portland local authorities are unwilling to protect these areas. And the reason that's important is the use of the Insurrection Act can happen when local governments are unable or unwilling to protect streets. And so I think that raised a lot of eyebrows here in Washington. Was he laying the groundwork for potentially invoking the Insurrection Act to an American city, to Portland or somewhere else? And the president made reference to it earlier this week and said he could invoke it but didn't have an immediate plan to but certainly suggested that that was something he would consider doing.</p><p>MOSLEY: I actually want us to hear his words directly. So this was President Trump when asked about the Insurrection Act during a White House press briefing on Monday. Let's listen.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'd do it if it was necessary. So far, it hasn't been necessary, but we have an Insurrection Act for a reason. If I had to enact it, I'd do that. If people were being killed and courts were holding us up or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I'd do that. I mean, I want to make sure that people aren't killed. We have to make sure that our cities are safe. And it's turning out - and we started with D.C. It's been so successful. Think of it. People wouldn't go to restaurants. The restaurants were closing. We were losing a lot of restaurants, as you all know. And now restaurants are opening, and they're thriving.</p><p>MOSLEY: That was President Trump being asked about the Insurrection Act. Walk us through the legal chess game in this instance because we know that the deployment of National Guardsmen up to this point, using that other statue that you brought up, is being contested in the courts. How likely could something like invoking the Insurrection Act be a reality?</p><p>YOUSSEF: I think, frankly, it could be because the legal language around it gives wide discretion to the president. The Insurrection Act, it gives the president the power to federalize National Guard troops anywhere in the United States to restore order during an insurrection, during some catastrophic, major breach of security in the country. And that hasn't happened yet, but there has been increased talk about it. The president has described what's happening in Portland, for example, as an insurrection, but hasn't provided evidence to support that. And, in fact, the local government says that they are able to maintain order, that they haven't made any arrests and that they don't need federal troops at federal buildings, and they certainly don't need the use of the Insurrection Act in their city. The reason I think there's a lot of concern about the use of the Insurrection Act is that has been used for extraordinary circumstances. It's been used less than 30 times across the history of this country. I think the time that we think about it that most listeners might be familiar with was in 1992 after the riots in response to the Rodney King trial. And so that was an extraordinary circumstance. And I think the concern is that if this is allowed to proceed, that it will lower the threshold for when the federal government can put military troops on American streets, that it's no longer for extraordinary circumstances but ones that fall far short of that.</p><p>MOSLEY: Have you heard anything about how these deployments are sitting with the National Guardsmen themselves?</p><p>YOUSSEF: It's funny. When you talk to them, there's a whole wide spectrum of responses. You'll have people who are really frustrated, for example, in Washington because some missed the first days of school with their children during this deployment. Some of them are feeling the stress in their own homes, in their own communities, in their own businesses. Then there are some who are delighted to be a part of this mission and that they see themselves as defending the nation's capital, that they're carrying out the president's mission.</p><p>We did a story with National Guardsmen, and one thing that jumped out to me is that when we ask them, what is your mission or the president's mission? - which was an interesting use of language to me because some might see themselves as really carrying out the vision of the use of National Guard as the president wants it. But that's different from a guard that often, up until that point, really largely defined themselves as protecting their communities or protecting the nation.</p><p>MOSLEY: ...The nation.</p><p>Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, we're talking with Nancy Youssef, national security staff writer for The Atlantic. We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF SLOWBERN'S "WHEN WAR WAS KING")</p><p>MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR, and today we're talking with Nancy Youssef, national security staff writer for The Atlantic. Our interview was recorded yesterday.</p><p>So, Nancy, all of this - the deployments, the legal battles, the rhetoric about the enemies within - it all connects back to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's speech last week, where he told military leaders, about 800 generals and admirals from around the world on short notice - and basically told them that the old military is over. And I want us to listen to just a bit of it.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PETE HEGSETH: This administration has done a great deal from Day 1 to remove the social justice, politically correct and toxic ideological garbage that had infected our department, to rip out the politics. No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses. No more climate change worship. No more division, distraction or gender delusions. No more debris. As I've said before and will say again, we are done with that [expletive]. I've made it my mission to uproot the obvious distractions that made us less capable and less lethal. That said, the War Department requires the next step. Underneath the woke garbage is a deeper problem and a more important problem that we are fixing and fixing fast. Common sense is back at the White House. So making the necessary changes is actually pretty straightforward.</p><p>MOSLEY: That was Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on September 30 at a Marine Corps base in Virginia. Nancy, beyond what he actually said, what we just heard, what made that gathering itself so unusual?</p><p>YOUSSEF: A couple things. I've been covering the Pentagon, and I was in Iraq and Afghanistan before that, so since 2003, and I've never seen a gathering of all generals and admirals. I mean, logistically, it's such a challenge. There were admirals who had to be pulled off of ships and then flown from ship to shore and then from shore to Washington for this gathering. And they arrived not knowing what the purpose of the meeting was. Some were asking themselves privately, what would I do if I was asked to take a loyalty test, for example? Some were telling their staffs I'm - what they would or wouldn't do in those situations. Some were trying to protect their staffs. And so usually, you would not gather that many because - and this sounds flip - they're busy. These guys are busy and they're busy on important missions, and they're supporting troops on the front line. And then to not know why sort of created a - I think, a climate of fear in the run-up to it.</p><p>And then during the conversation - you know, usually, secretaries of defense in the past have focused on sort of thinking about fighting the next war, the future of the military 10 or 20 years. And what they heard from Hegseth was a lot of focus on things that usually don't come from a secretary in terms of the priorities - fitness and social programs. Usually, those are things that are reserved for lower-ranking officers. It was, to me, a speech that was sort of an extension of his book in which he argues a lot of these same points, and those views and that book was based on his experience as a National Guard major. And so I think a lot of those in the room heard a message that this secretary of defense wants a very different force. I think if you're a woman - and we heard from women who kind of kept hearing if there's going to be same standards across, and then they want to be judged for what they do. You know, he said repeatedly, we have to - sort of suggests that there have been lower standards for women. There haven't been.</p><p>And I think the message that the generals heard more than anything was - I mean, frankly, a lot of them joked that they kind of got lectured by a major. But they didn't hear something that sort of was unifying, but really looking for ways to narrow the definition of what makes an exceptional soldier, sailor, airman or Marine. Up until this point, I think the military really celebrated exceptional Americans of different backgrounds, different races, different genders. And the secretary really kind of narrowed that definition to a certain kind of troop, a certain kind of American with certain views. And I think that was the message that came across more than any other.</p><p>MOSLEY: That's really interesting about how they said they felt like they were being lectured by a major because, of course, in the military, hierarchy is super important. Many of those people in the room have more experience than Hegseth. What are you hearing from both rank-and-file service members afterwards? When they were able to talk about it and parse out, what was the takeaway for them to go back to their bases and places? Like, what did they interpret as the directive?</p><p>YOUSSEF: The thing I hear more than anything is sort of fear about what they can say, what they can do, what they cannot do. For some in the room, I think they wondered if they were being sort of personally targeted in some way, that they wouldn't be welcome in a military that they spent decades serving.</p><p>MOSLEY: Because many of them are those identities. They are women. They are people of color.</p><p>YOUSSEF: And they got there because of their qualifications. This assumption that there was some sort of favor done to let them in, you know, in many ways, the military - and I'm not saying that it's perfect, but it is a meritocracy. It is harder for women and people of color to advance in this military. I don't want to oversimplify it. But there's a lot of meritocracy in that system as well. And there has been efforts over time to make sure that that is more in place, not less so. I did a story a few years ago with a general who was trying to interview future colonels and put them behind a screen so that those evaluating them couldn't see them, that they could remove identifying factors so that you could really judge rising colonels based on their merits. So there have been efforts to get at this. The other interesting thing that happened is there was such an awareness about the message they were sending with their response.</p><p>If you'll remember, in June, President Trump came to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. And there were lower ranking troops there who were cheering when he was mocking President Biden, who were buying Trump merchandise that was being sold nearby and putting it on their uniforms. And there was such an awareness that how they reacted was going to send a message to the force and to the country, that they see themselves as an apolitical force and that they are there to defend the nation, and that they're there not to only defend certain causes or certain parts of the country or against certain threats. And so there was a real awareness about reactions, which is why you didn't see any. I think they were trying to send a message to the country, but also to lower ranking troops, that this is the expectation in terms of how you respond, that we remain America's military and we are here to defend the nation.</p><p>MOSLEY: I mean, just thinking about some of those initiatives that really have been part of the fabric of the military for several decades. If you're a woman in the military right now or LGBTQ, a person of color, where do you turn at this moment if you face discrimination? Have the headwinds turned pretty quickly? What are you hearing?</p><p>YOUSSEF: I'm hearing people really consider whether they can stay and also what to tell people coming up behind them, whether they should encourage them to stay in because they don't know. I mean, in that speech, the secretary also said, you know, people are accused of bullying too often and that we need to reassess that sort of standard, that we're not going to ruin people's careers over minor infractions but then was quite vague about what a minor infraction was. Which for some people, these were a lot of the checks that were put in place to make sure that there's an equal opportunity, to make sure that people are protected - that if they, for example, complain of sexual harassment that it won't be career-ending for the person who was harassed but for the person who did the harassment.</p><p>And so what I hear from a lot of people is a question about whether they can continue to serve. Now, having said that, there are people both in that room and certainly across the force who saw that message as important and necessary, that too much time had been taken, focused on social issues and not enough on war fighting, that the military needs to get back to a standard, that it needs to be more focused on physical fitness. So for some people, it resonated that the force had gotten too off of mark of its priorities. For others, though, I think particularly for women and minorities that I've spoken to, there's a feeling that maybe I'm not welcome here anymore. And I've had service members tell me that directly, really asking themselves, is there a place for me in this military going forward?</p><p>MOSLEY: You know, the timing is striking because I was also reading that there has been, over the last few years, a steady uptick of particularly Black recruitment and Hispanic recruitment under the military's DEI policies. Is there kind of the bet that Hegseth can attract more recruits from a conservative base that might be turned off by diversity? And does that math actually work when there has been a struggle in the past to find qualified people to enlist?</p><p>YOUSSEF: I think it depends on what kind of military you see in the future. If you see a smaller military, if you see one that doesn't need to represent, sort of in terms of its physical composition, the American population - it doesn't fully now, right? The middle of the country is where the majority of service members come from. But if that's the goal then this becomes harder.</p><p>If the goal is a smaller military, one that sort of is more homogenous in terms of values - where they're more focused on internal threats, where we don't have as many troops in Europe or in the Middle East, where we're depending more on drones and other technology and less so on having a physical foot presence in those areas - then it might work. And I think that's the ultimate question. What kind of military do they see? They're hinting at it, but they haven't spelled it out.</p><p>MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. Our guest today is Nancy Youssef, national security writer for The Atlantic. We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Tonya Mosley, and this is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF WAYNE HORVITZ'S "IN FIELDS THEY LAY")</p><p>MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Tonya Mosley. And today, I'm talking with Nancy Youssef, national security writer for The Atlantic. She's been reporting on the fallout from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's recent remarks and what they potentially signal about the future of the U.S. military and its relationship to American democracy. Youssef has covered national security and the military for two decades, reporting in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Pentagon. Her latest story explores how senior military leaders are interpreting this moment and what it could mean for civil military relations in the United States. Youssef has also worked for The Wall Street Journal and McClatchy newspapers. Our interview was recorded yesterday.</p><p>You know, something that Hegseth referred to - he referred to the time period of the 1990s almost as some sort of golden age. And there's a lot of change that was happening back then, but I also wanted to note that women first flew combat missions in the '90s. But then there was also Don't Ask, Don't Tell as a policy. So what version of the '90s does he want to return to?</p><p>YOUSSEF: He didn't say in this speech. He said, we'll just pick a year. He mentioned General Schwarzkopf as a kind of general that the U.S. military should be like. I think he sort of suggested because that was the last major military win and referring to the Gulf War. I mean, the thing is, though, you know, one year after that period was the Tailhook scandal in which 70-plus women and seven men were sexually harassed and assaulted at a convention. Generals had tried to complain about this conference and the behavior that happened there in the years prior and were ignored. A lot of the reforms that we have in place now were a product of the mistakes of that period.</p><p>Moreover, the idea that the 1990 war was sort of the metric, you could argue that the U.S. had to - didn't finish that war. And one of the reasons that you saw the U.S. intervention ramp up afterwards in the Middle East was because of sort of the consequences of that war. And so he seemed to suggest that it was a time when you had fewer women, you had fewer restrictions. But just scratch below the surface, it was not a time that everybody could serve and serve in an environment that they felt that was safe and fair to them.</p><p>MOSLEY: Nancy, Hegseth isn't just changing who's in the military and what they do. He's also controlling who military leaders can even talk to. So you reported on this back in July. Tell us what happened with the Aspen Security Forum. And it might actually help for you to go over exactly what is the Aspen Security Forum and then tell us what happened.</p><p>YOUSSEF: Sure. This is part of a broader restriction that the secretary's putting on generals, admirals, civilians to talk about what the Pentagon is doing. So military officers go to maybe hundreds of conferences across the services a year, and one reason they go is to show the American public who they are, to engage, to have conversations, to hear ideas from different places. And there's one that's held every year, every summer in July called the Aspen Security Institute, and it's sort of one of the bigger ones where you see a lot of four stars going. They meet with top policymakers, and that's really an opportunity to have sort of a broad discussion about national security.</p><p>Immediately before that conference was supposed to begin, the secretary issued guidance that essentially said that those generals and admirals couldn't go, that there would be restrictions on what they could go to going forward and that they needed approval from the department before they go to such conferences in the future. And so you had people, in some cases, getting ready to board flights who had to cancel their plans because they were not allowed to go to something that has been really a staple in terms of formats where there can be discussions outside of the Pentagon about national security. And I've gone to several of them, and I do find that often when you're in Washington, you know, you end up looking at things from where you sit, and that there are so many opportunities at those kinds of forums to just hear different thoughts or get a sense in terms of how national security policy is being received outside of the building. And so I think that's why so many agree to do it. And so now you're seeing far fewer generals and admirals going to such events and even lower ranking, for that matter, and that those that they are allowed to go to tend to be organizations that are perceived to have a political affiliation or agreement with the administration, which hadn't happened historically in the past.</p><p>MOSLEY: Can you briefly just go a little bit deeper on the value of these events for these military officials? Because I just want to get a clear understanding of what could potentially happen when you cut the Pentagon off from those types of events.</p><p>YOUSSEF: Well, you know, only a small, small percentage of Americans even serve in the military. So even though it gets nearly a trillion now of taxpayer dollars, I think a lot of people don't understand the military. They haven't been exposed to it in a way that gives them a real understanding of what the military does. And sometimes these formats offer opportunities for the military to introduce themselves to the American public.</p><p>In addition, so many of these events that they go to, there are people who are doing work that might on the face of it not seem relevant or useful to the military. But they might introduce the military to new technologies where interest can overlap, where they can sort of advance a technology because they're seeing it used somewhere else. Sometimes it's meeting officers from other countries and seeing how they're tackling a threat versus how the United States is tackling a threat. Sometimes it's just the face-to-face meeting to get to know somebody so that in the future, if there is some sort of conflict and you need to be able to get somebody on the phone, you've had that face-to-face interaction that can be the difference between the right and the wrong response to a crisis.</p><p>And so it's just an opportunity for real discourse that their jobs usually don't allow. They're often so immersed in the problem set in front of them and around other military officers, around like-minded thinkers that the opportunity to get outside of that and think outside of that. And how each side can bring lessons and experiences to the other has - from the cheap seats where I sit, has been beneficial.</p><p>MOSLEY: Well, let's talk a little bit about the cheap seats where you sit, your job. In September, Hegseth told Pentagon reporters, sign this pledge. Don't report anything, even unclassified information, without our approval. Now The New York Times is reporting that those rules have been relaxed. What's actually going on?</p><p>YOUSSEF: So...</p><p>MOSLEY: And how has your job been impacted?</p><p>YOUSSEF: I don't see the rules as loosened. Well, let me begin by saying what the rules were. So we've had a wonderful opportunity as Pentagon reporters in that we could walk most of the building. Now, that doesn't mean we could go into secure rooms or go into areas. There are many, many, many secure areas, most of them. But you could walk and hear and get a sense of how headquarters, the mood of headquarters as it was contemplating these decisions. And so it's been an enormous resource for us.</p><p>Now, having said that, it's also been to the great benefit of the Pentagon, because the Pentagon had never let us in as a favor to us, but they understood that if you're going to ask for such an enormous amount of money, and for American families to volunteer their sons and daughters to serve, that they had an obligation and actually a benefit in showing the American public what was being done with that money, the decision-makers behind it. It's why they did embeds, for example, when they allowed us the experience of being in the Humvee with them and experiencing what we as a country were asking them to do.</p><p>And so this has been the case since the Pentagon opened in 1943, through many wars, through many tense moments between the press and the Department of Defense. In May, we were told we could only walk through certain hallways. And now they set new rules that in order for us to continue to be in the building, they have to sign off on what we ask - not publish, ask - that the mere solicitation of information unapproved could lead to us being kicked out of the building. So for example, if I were to...</p><p>MOSLEY: Right, I was going to say, yes, how did that work?</p><p>YOUSSEF: I don't know. Let's say I ask someone, where is the USS Truman operating in? What ocean? That's a violation because it wasn't sort of through the channels as they spell them out. And I should note, this wasn't brought about because there was some egregious security violation, there weas some breach that happened, there was some threat to national security that demanded some change. This has been part of a consistent message from the secretary that he doesn't want the military engaging with mainstream press, for lack of a better term. That he wants to engage directly on social media and only speak to those who sort of are like-minded in their views of his conduct.</p><p>He doesn't do regular interviews. You know, up until this point, and certainly during the wars, we had secretaries and chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff who regularly came into the brief room and answered questions. That doesn't happen anymore. There aren't regular briefings. It's so hard to get basic information now. And once we're out of the building, if that's what happens, it'll be even harder. And I worry about the chilling effect because the messaging is, you, general officers, you, leadership, don't have to engage. You don't owe anybody answers to such consequential decisions that you're making.</p><p>MOSLEY: You're worried about the chilling effect. But, I mean, isn't this also a violation of the First Amendment? Doesn't this run into First Amendment problems?</p><p>YOUSSEF: So here's what the Pentagon would say. You can keep reporting. You just can't do it from the building. You just can't have access to the building. So therefore, we're not violating your First Amendment right. Now, does that go with the spirit of the First Amendment, the spirit of this country? I would argue, no, that we have encouraged a robust conversation about policies and demanded answers of the leaders making them. So that's the way that they're arguing in terms of the First Amendment right, because they have the discretion over who comes into the building. But it's not clear whether we can still go to any military installation. And does it create sort of two tiers, those who agree and those who don't?</p><p>MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, we're talking with Nancy Youssef, national security staff writer for The Atlantic. We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF THE AMERICAN ANALOG SET SONG, "WEATHER REPORT")</p><p>MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. And today, we're talking with Nancy Youssef, national security staff writer for The Atlantic. Our interview was recorded yesterday.</p><p>Nancy, I want to talk just a little bit about how the military is now operating outside of the country. There was this incident that happened back in September in the Caribbean. Trump announced the U.S. Navy struck a boat from Venezuela, killing 11 people who were aboard that boat. There have been more strikes since then. I think there are more than 20 people who have died. What is the latest that you know about that situation?</p><p>YOUSSEF: So it's a great question because it is an unprecedented use of military force against drug traffickers. So the administration has said that they want to use the military to combat drug trafficking, and that they have named some narco trafficking groups as foreign terrorist organizations. When they describe those on these boats, they use language that we used to reserve for al-Qaida and ISIS, calling them combatants and saying that...</p><p>MOSLEY: Unlawful combatants, yes.</p><p>YOUSSEF: That's right, which we hadn't - you know, you think of that more for groups like al-Qaida. And that they need to strike these boats to stop the flow of drugs into the United States. The problem is we don't actually know, nor have they told us in any detail, who's on these boats, why striking these boats in particular combats that problem. The president has described fentanyl as the drug that he wants to stop from entering the United States. Well, fentanyl doesn't come from Venezuela. There are countries that are trafficking more drugs than Venezuela by a lot. Venezuela is more for transiting drugs. But Colombia, Mexico, if we're going after a drug problem, it would seem like those are the countries one would target more.</p><p>And it's not clear how hitting these boats, even if they have drugs on them, has an enduring impact on drug trafficking in the United States, nor has the administration described it. Secretary Hegseth has put out on social media this is protecting the American people. but I'm not sure that it's clear how. If this is truly about going after drugs and using the military for something that had been reserved for law enforcement - and you would bring in the Coast Guard in a law enforcement capacity as part of that. If we're going to turn that now into a military mission, it's not clear why now, why these targets, what the end state looks like and whether it is legal to go after drug traffickers, because the foreign terrorist designation in and of itself doesn't legally justify it. Again, we haven't gotten any clarity from the administration. Earlier this week, Pam Bondi was on Capitol Hill and asked about the legal justification and said she wouldn't answer it. We've heard from the administration that this is a new, better use of the U.S. military, that we're going to focus on threats in the Western Hemisphere, that this is a threat to the United States. But I don't know that there's been a clear line drawn between these specific strikes and that threat.</p><p>The other interesting thing to me is, you know, this idea of going after non-state actors. This has faced legal questions than before - with al-Qaida, the courts had some questions at the beginning about it and said because they are seeking to destroy the United States, they can be considered a threat that should be dealt with militarily. These drug traffickers have not said that. Their aim is not to destroy the United States. Their aim is profit. And so it's not clear to me legally how these strikes are being justified. They are because they're still happening, but we haven't heard more of an explanation. What we have heard the administration say is that more of these strikes are coming.</p><p>MOSLEY: You're actually - you've been doing some reporting on this. What are some things that you're looking at and watching for?</p><p>YOUSSEF: So what's interesting to me is why the administration has chosen this to use U.S. military force on. I mean, these are the most aggressive strikes happening by the U.S. military from anywhere that I can say. I mean, we've had strikes against Iran and against the Houthis in Yemen, but right now this is the most aggressive military campaign.</p><p>And I think there's a Venn diagram of sort of interest happening where you have people like Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has been a long advocate of opposition in Venezuela, who want to see the Maduro government fall. It's an illegitimate government by the United States' standards, stayed in power even after election deemed otherwise. There are people like Stephen Miller and JD Vance who I think see this as a way to project power. They see it as a form of deterrence against drug traffickers, that even if they're not the sort of ones that are posing the biggest threat, that the hope is that drug traffickers will see this and take from it that they shouldn't be sending drugs into the United States. And then there's the president himself who has indicated that he wants to use the U.S. military in different ways, who sees these strikes as a way to sort of have an influence on the world stage. And it's hard to push back, I think, for some because the administration will say you're defending drug traffickers. So the sort of questions around these strikes, I think, are harder for some who oppose them to make.</p><p>MOSLEY: Nancy, you've covered the Pentagon for decades. How would you characterize this moment?</p><p>YOUSSEF: I think it's a potential inflection point in terms of the use of U.S. military force, what we constitute as a threat, how big we want the military to be, what we want it to look like. The decisions that are being made now will reshape the military for many years. It takes years to kind of train an officer, to build an ethos within the force. And, like, the changes can happen very quickly, but the consequences of them will take years to play out. And I think we're at this point where there's a real question about what is the U.S. military here for now? What kind of threats do we consider a priority? What is our relationship with our allies? What can they count on us for? There's a lot of changes happening. And to be clear, there are some people who welcome those changes. But it is an important inflection point for a military that has really projected itself as the leading defenders of the rule-based order and a certain moral view on how foreign policy should be conducted.</p><p>MOSLEY: Nancy Youssef, thank you so much.</p><p>YOUSSEF: Thank you.</p><p>MOSLEY: Nancy Youssef, national security correspondent for The Atlantic. Coming up, film critic Justin Chang reviews Luca Guadagnino's new film "After The Hunt," starring Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri.

<div class="article-title">What to know about the Nobel Peace Prize</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Anticipation is growing and bookies around the world are taking bets on who'll be awarded this year's Nobel Peace Prize, with President Trump among the most high-profile — and controversial — contenders.</p> <p>On Friday, the Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the winner. The committee says the award goes to the person or organization that has done the most "for fraternity between the nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses."</p> <p>Trump has received multiple nominations and has never made a secret of his desire to win the prestigious accolade. And, as the first phase of his Gaza peace plan makes headway, the focus on the prospect of him winning is intensifying.</p>
<p>Here's what to know ahead of this year's announcement.</p> <h3 class="edTag">How did the peace prize come about? </h3> <p>In his 1895 will, Swedish inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel declared his fortune should be divided into five parts to honor outstanding achievements in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and for work in peace.</p> <p>The first prizes were given in 1901 and are now announced every October and awarded in a ceremony in December. In 1968, a new prize was established — the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences.</p>
<p>Thousands of people can choose to nominate a person or organization as a candidate for the peace prize, though you cannot nominate yourself. Those eligible to nominate a candidate include members of national governments, officials with international peace organizations, university professors and former recipients.</p>
<p>The recipients of four of the prizes are decided by a Swedish committee, while the recipient of the peace prize is decided by a Norwegian committee composed of five members appointed by the Norwegian parliament. The peace prize committee deliberates in secret for months before coming up with a shortlist and narrowing it down to pick the winner.</p> <p>The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize receives a medal and about $1.17 million in prize money.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Who has won it in the past?</h3> <p>Some of the world's most famous names have won in the past, including former South African presidents Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk in 1993 for bringing a peaceful end to apartheid and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1964 for his nonviolent civil rights struggle. Mother Theresa, the Dalai Lama and Malala Yousafzai are also all past winners.</p>
<p>The prize has also gone to people or groups that are not household names. Last year it was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo, a Japanese grassroots movement of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p> <p>The awarding of the prize has also courted controversy. Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger received the prize in 1973 along with North Vietnam's chief communist negotiator, Le Duc Tho, for establishing the Paris Peace Accords — which led to America's exit from the Vietnam War. Tho declined the award, but the decision to award Kissinger shocked many of his critics who saw him as a warmonger.</p>
<p>Also controversial was President Barack Obama's Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, just months into his first term. Some criticized the decision, saying the president hadn't had time to prove himself. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed received the award for efforts to reach peace with neighboring Eritrea in 2019. He later went on to wage a brutal war in Ethiopia's northernmost region of Tigray.</p>
<p>Leaders in the Americas, including Costa Rica and Colombia, as well as human rights defenders in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine have also won the award.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Who is nominated this time?</h3> <p>There are 338 candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize this year — 244 individuals and 94 organizations.</p> <p>At the center of intense speculation about this year's award is President Trump, who is currently engaged in negotiations to end the war in Gaza. </p> <p>The Nobel website does not list the candidates, although some of the nominators have told the media who they've put forward. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have both confirmed they nominated Trump.</p>
<p>Trump has  repeatedly said he deserves the prize, saying he's ended multiple wars this year already, although fact-checkers dispute the claim as several conflicts he has attempted to end remain ongoing. Earlier this year he said at the White House: "They will never give me a Nobel Peace Prize. I deserve it, but they will never give it to me."</p> <p>Other names making the rounds as possible winners this year include Sudan's Emergency Response Rooms, a volunteer network helping civilians despite great risk in the midst of the country's civil war, and Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny.</p> <p>In terms of the likelihood of Trump winning, the Gaza ceasefire may come too late to change the outcome of this year's award, and the committee is known to value sustained peace efforts over quick political wins.</p> <p>However, as of Thursday morning, bookmakers' odds had Trump and the Sudanese group as the joint favorites, according to Oddschecker.</p>

<div class="article-title">The 10th and final escapee from a New Orleans jailbreak is captured after five months</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Derrick Groves, the last of the 10 men who escaped from a New Orleans prison in May, was captured in the crawl space of a home in Atlanta on Wednesday.</p> <p>The escapees, who ranged in age from their teens to early 40s, broke out of the Orleans Parish Justice Center in the early hours of May 16 by climbing through a hole in the wall behind a toilet, scaling a fence and crossing an interstate.</p> <p>By the time authorities discovered them missing during a routine morning head count, they were long gone, leaving behind a smiley face and several taunting messages — including "To easy LoL" — scrawled on the bathroom wall.</p>
<p>Three of the escapees were recaptured in New Orleans later that same day, and all but two had been taken into custody by the end of May. The ninth inmate, Antoine Massey, was apprehended six weeks after the jailbreak, in late June.</p>
<p>That left only Groves on the run. The 28-year-old convicted murderer eluded authorities for months, despite a multiagency effort to track him down.</p> <p>Louisiana State Police Superintendent Robert Hodges told reporters on Wednesday that the task force investigating the jailbreak learned in early October that Groves was likely in the Atlanta area. They traced him to a particular residence through "information gathered via multiple search warrants and other investigative means."</p> <p>Police, U.S. marshals and a SWAT team arrived at the house in southwest Atlanta to execute warrants and ultimately took Groves into custody after what police described as a brief standoff.</p> <p>"We deployed a number of canisters of gas to help move him throughout the house … he moved to the basement of the house," Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Kelley Collier said at the scene. "Soon after, Clayton County K-9 was deployed in the crawl space of the location, and found him in that crawl space."</p> <p>Officials declined to say what brought Groves to that particular house or how long he had been there. But Collier said no one else was inside at the time of his apprehension.</p>
<p>A video of Groves' arrest, shared by the Atlanta Police Department, shows Groves blowing a kiss to the camera as he is helped into the back of a cruiser.</p> <p>Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry cheered the news of the 10th and final escapee's capture on social media.</p> <p>"You picked the wrong State," Landry wrote. "Thank you to our incredible law enforcement officials from the federal, state, and local level who worked tirelessly to put each of these men back where they belong: BEHIND BARS."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">What happens next? </h3> <p>Groves was convicted last October and sentenced to life in prison on two counts of murder in connection with a 2018 Mardi Gras-day double shooting.</p> <p>He was also convicted of two counts of attempted murder and a federal firearms charge, for which he was awaiting sentencing at the Orleans Parish Justice Center at the time of the jailbreak.</p> <p>Groves, like the other nine escapees, has also been charged with simple escape. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said he has a hearing scheduled for Thursday at which he can choose to waive extradition, or else the state will initiate proceedings to bring him back.</p>
<p>"He will be arraigned on those charges as soon as we get him back from Georgia," Murrill said at Wednesday's press conference, adding that he will eventually join the other escapees in the Louisiana State Penitentiary.</p> <p>Murrill said her office is looking into whether it can upgrade Groves' charges to aggravated escape in light of the materials discovered at the Atlanta house, which she said "included weapons and drugs."</p> <p>She also said she expects Groves to be prosecuted in Georgia, "and possibly by the feds."</p> <p>"He's got a lot of trouble and a lot of things to answer to, to both the state of Louisiana and the state of Georgia," Murrill said, adding that the manhunt was expensive, as well as scary for district attorney staff, victims and witnesses in the cases that put Groves behind bars.</p>
<p>"It's a very unsettling thing to have somebody out like this … so today is a very good day."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Who else is facing charges? </h3> <p>Murrill vowed that anyone who may have helped Groves will be arrested and prosecuted.</p> <p>More than a dozen people have been arrested for aiding the escapees, both in prison and once they got out.</p> <p>Those include a jail employee who told investigators that he turned the water off in the cell after one of the inmates "threatened to shank him" (he maintains he was just unclogging a toilet and was unaware of the escape plans), as well as another man being held in the same prison who faces 10 counts of "principal to simple escape."</p> <p>In the weeks after the jailbreak, authorities charged 11 other people with "accessory after the fact" for alleged actions including contacting the inmates by phone before and after their escape, transporting them on the outside and supplying some with food and cash.</p> <p>Another twist came in June, when a former correctional center employee — and Groves' girlfriend — was arrested on a felony charge of conspiracy to commit simple escape "in connection with the recent escape of multiple inmates."</p>
<p>Murrill's office said Darriana Burton, Groves' "on-again, off-again" girlfriend of three years, was a sheriff's office employee from August 2022 until March 2023, when she was fired — but not charged — for bringing contraband into the jail.</p> <p>The Associated Press, citing a police affidavit for Burton's arrest, reported that Groves video-called Burton on a jail-issued iPad two days before the escape and she helped him speak with an unidentified man in a vague conversation that "appeared to coordinate communication on other, unmonitored lines." A judge set her bond at $2.5 million.</p> <p>Louisiana politicians say there are others to blame for the jailbreak, pointing the finger at each other as well as broader systemic failures.</p>
<p>Gov. Landry, a Republican who has pushed a tough-on-crime agenda, has blamed progressive politics and ordered multiple investigations into New Orleans' criminal justice system. Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson has taken responsibility for the jailbreak but also blamed a lack of resources, from faulty locks to staffing shortages, as well as the escapees' network of accomplices.</p> <p>In July, another inmate at the same jail was mistakenly released due to what officials say was a clerical error stemming from two similar last names. Khalil Bryan was captured in August after a monthlong manhunt, and two deputies were fired over the incident. That same month, Hutson announced the facility had secured $15 million to make safety and security upgrades.</p>

<div class="article-title">Why being in credit card debt doesn't mean you're bad with money</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>People can feel a lot of shame about being in credit card debt. They think it means they're bad with money. That it's something to avoid, or a burden they can never pay off.</p>
<p>But for financial educator Rita-Soledad Fernández Paulino, founder of Wealth Para Todos, we should simply see debt for what it is. "It's just what we use when we don't have access to cash reserves," she says. </p> <p>And unfortunately, our assumptions and emotions around debt can prevent us from managing our money with confidence,<strong> </strong>she says. They can stop us from being honest with ourselves about our financial situation, getting the support we need to pay off our debt or even leveraging debt to our advantage.</p>
<p>Here are three common debt myths and how they can affect our finances.</p> <h2 class="edTag">Myth: People in credit card debt are terrible with money </h2> <p>Some people think that those with debt have a spending problem or don't know how to budget, says Fernández Paulino. But that's often not the case.</p> <p>About 45% of respondents to a 2025 Bankrate survey said that their credit card debt came from emergencies or unexpected expenses. That includes car problems, medical bills and home repairs.</p> <p>People also rack up debt during stressful life events. "The clients that come my way have usually dealt with the death of a loved one and are struggling with so much grief that they struggle to show up for work," Fernández Paulino says. "Or they've been dealing with medical issues and are in debt for treatment."</p> <p>That's why it's so important to stash money away for emergencies while creating your plan to pay down your debt, she says. If an unforeseen event happens and you don't have those funds, you may get stuck in another cycle of debt.</p> <p><strong><em>Create your plan to pay down debt. Sign up for Life Kit's newsletter series. </em></strong></p> <h2 class="edTag">Myth: You should avoid debt at all costs </h2> <p>People may feel scared or guilty about using a credit card for many reasons. Maybe they grew up in a family that struggled with debt, didn't talk about finances or dealt with bankruptcy or a home foreclosure, Fernández Paulino says. "They grow up thinking: Debt is the problem, so I'm never going to use it."</p>
<p>Others avoid credit cards because they grew up with misconceptions about debt, stemming from a lack of knowledge about how finances work in the U.S., says Fernández Paulino, who works with many immigrants. "So when they start using a credit card, they don't know how to use it."</p> <p>Everyone should have at least one credit card in good standing, says John Kiernan, managing editor of WalletHub, a personal finance website. "It sends positive information to the credit bureaus each month, which makes your credit report look better and leads to a better credit score, which opens a lot of doors for lending."</p> <p>Learning more about how debt works can help you understand how to use your credit card strategically, Fernández Paulino says.</p> <p><strong><em>To learn more about how credit cards work, sign up for Life Kit's newsletter series. </em></strong></p> <h2 class="edTag">Myth: Getting out of debt is impossible </h2> <p>"It isn't true that you can't get out of debt," Fernández Paulino says. "What's true is that without enough monthly surplus — money left after fixed expenses and variable expenses, minimum payments and some saving — progress is slow."</p> <p>If you want to pay off your debt faster, focus on "building a surplus so there's significant extra cash to throw at balances," she says. That might mean tightening your budget to save more money, or getting an extra source of income.</p> <p>"When clients build that surplus, they can make dents quickly," she says. "I've had clients eliminate five figures of debt in six months, others take 12-36 months."</p> <p>The timeline of when you pay off your debt is driven by three variables: starting balance, interest rate and consistent extra cash flow, she says.</p> <p><strong><em>Find out how to save money in your budget to pay off debt.
