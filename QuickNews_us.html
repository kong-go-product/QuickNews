<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Pakistan's defense minister on Wednesday threatened to "obliterate" the Taliban, which controls neighboring Afghanistan, after negotiations toward lasting peace between the two sides failed.</p><p>Peace talks wrapped up in Istanbul, Turkey, without a "workable solution," according to Pakistan Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, which comes after deadly clashes this month. Dozens were killed along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan in the worst violence in the area since the Taliban took control of Kabul in 2021.</p><p>Negotiations ended with a disagreement over terror groups allegedly using Afghanistan as a base to attack security forces along Pakistan's border.</p><p>"Pakistan does not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding," Pakistan Defense Minister Khawaja Asif said on X.</p><p>The two countries agreed to a ceasefire brokered in Doha, Qatar, on October 19, but they could not find common ground in a second round of talks mediated by Turkey and Qatar in Istanbul, according to Reuters.</p><p>Both countries blamed the other for the talks falling apart.</p><p>"The Afghan side kept deviating from the core issue ... on which the dialogue process was initiated," Pakistan's information minister said on Wednesday, accusing the Taliban of engaging in deflection, ruses and playing a "blame game."</p><p>"The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution," he said.</p><p>A Pakistani security source told Reuters that the Taliban had been unwilling to agree to reining in the Pakistani Taliban, a separate terror group that Pakistan says operates without consequences from inside Afghanistan.</p><p>An Afghan source familiar with the talks told the outlet that negotiations ended after "tense exchanges" on the matter, noting that Afghanistan claimed it had no control over the Pakistani Taliban.</p><p>The Pakistani Taliban launched attacks against the Pakistani military in recent weeks.</p><p>The clashes began earlier this month after Pakistani air strikes targeted the head of the Pakistani Taliban in Kabul and other locations.</p><p>The Taliban retaliated with attacks on Pakistani military posts along the length of the 1,600-mile border that remains closed.</p><p>Pakistan's defense minister said on Saturday that he believed Afghanistan sought peace but that the failure to reach an agreement in Istanbul would mean "open war."</p><p>And despite a ceasefire between Pakistan and the Taliban, clashes over the weekend resulted in the killings of five Pakistani soldiers and 25 Pakistani Taliban members near the border with Afghanistan.</p><p><i>Reuters contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Blue Jays one win from World Series title after Trey Yesavage's dominant Game 5 performance</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Trey Yesavage’s final start of a wild 2025 season, which began in Single-A ball to pitching his second World Series game for the Toronto Blue Jays, ends with a pivotal masterpiece.</p><p>Yesavage, the 22-year-old who worked his wall through the Blue Jays’ minor league system to eventually cement himself as a key member of this postseason run, delivered a seven-inning masterclass on the mound at Dodger Stadium to help Toronto defeat Los Angeles, 6-1, in Game 5 of the World Series. </p><p>Thanks to the efforts of Yesavage, and some more timely hitting by this Blue Jays lineup, Toronto is heading back north with only one more win needed to win the World Series. </p><p>Yesavage struck out 12 Dodgers hitters and allowed just three hits and one earned run over a 104-pitch performance that saw 10 of those strikeouts in the first five innings of the contest. </p><p>The only other person to do that in MLB history? Dodgers legend Sandy Koufax, who was right behind home plate watching Game 5 at Dodger Stadium. </p><p>In Game 1, Yesavage didn’t have his go-to pitch, a sharp-dropping splitter, which forced him to use his slider more often than he was used to. As a result, he was touched up by the Dodgers, though the Blue Jays’ own offensive onslaught resulted in a Game 1 victory at home. </p><p>This time around, Yesavage had the perfect touch with the pitch and the Dodgers couldn’t figure it out like the New York Yankees and the Seattle Mariners before them this postseason. Also, the slider was quite complementary with his mid-90s fastball keeping hitters honest at the dish. </p><p>And it also helped that Yesavage had some quick insurance on the scoreboard as his opponent, Blake Snell, allowed two solo home runs on the first three pitches of the game. </p><p>First, it was Davis Schneider taking the first pitch he saw over the fence to set the tone immediately for Toronto. Then, Vladimir Guerrero Jr.’s dream postseason continued as he belted his eighth home run this October to make it 2-0 in favor of the road team in this crucial Game 5. </p><p>In the bottom of the third, Yesavage’s only blemish of the game came on a 2-0 count to Enrique Hernandez, who didn’t flinch at a splitter up in the zone. He turned and parked it, as the baseball flew over the left field fence and reenergized the Dodger Stadium crowd that had been lifeless since the Guerrero homer. </p><p>But it didn’t last long, as the Blue Jays responded in the next frame. Teoscar Hernandez overplayed a Daulton Varsho hit to right field, and it cost him, as Varsho sprinted all the way to third base. Ernie Clement would hit a sacrifice fly to score him and take the two-run lead back. </p><p>As Yesavage kept cruising, the Blue Jays widened the gap necessary to come away with the victory in the top of the seventh when Addison Barger scored on a single and three wild pitches, while Bo Bichette singled home Andres Gimenez to make it a 5-1 ball game. Isiah Kiner-Falefa’s single in the top of the eighth was added insurance, as Clement came across to score. </p><p>With Yesavage’s night complete, Blue Jays manager John Schneider went to Seranthony Dominguez and closer Jeff Hoffman to shut the door on Game 5, and that’s exactly what they did to give themselves two chances at securing the franchise’s first World Series since 1993. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Dodgers, winners of last year’s World Series, have their backs against the wall. They will need to win the next two games to retain their title, and they’ll have the right man on the mound for it. </p><p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto seeks his third straight complete game, as he was a much-needed leader in Game 2’s victory for Los Angeles. He will face Kevin Gausman, who had a great performance until giving up some solo homers in Game 2 in Toronto. </p><p>First pitch in Game 6 will come on Halloween night in Toronto at 8:08 p.m. ET.   </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Baseball Hall of Famer Derek Jeter knows all too well the feeling of celebrating on the baseball diamond after clinching a World Series title.</p><p>The New York Yankees legend and MLB on FOX analyst spoke with Los Angeles Dodgers star Mookie Betts ahead of Game 5 of the 2025 World Series. </p><p>Jeter asked Betts, who won a World Series with the Boston Red Sox before joining Los Angeles, about the total number of championship rings he’s earned.</p><p>"How many rings you got?" Jeter asked.</p><p>"Three," Betts responded.</p><p>"Two and a half?" Jeter quipped as Betts laughed. Jeter then clarified, "I'm just playing. Dodgers fans, I’m playing. It's a joke amongst friends, I'm just joking."</p><p>Jeter won five World Series rings during his storied career as "The Captain" of the Yankees.

<div class="article-title">Trump cuts China tariff after Xi signals tougher fentanyl enforcement, rare-earth pause</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump on Thursday said he will cut tariffs on Chinese imports after a highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, citing new understandings on fentanyl enforcement, farm trade, and a pause on rare-earth export limits. </p><p>The meeting in the City of Busan marked the final stop of Trump’s Asia trip, which also included stops in Malaysia and Japan, and focused on cooling the economic standoff between Washington and Beijing. </p><p>Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has levied major tariffs on Chinese imports – a move that prompted Beijing to tighten its control over exports of rare earth elements. Both leaders signaled interest in reducing tensions to avoid further shocks to the global economy. </p><p>Ahead of Thursday's summit, U.S. and Chinese aides signaled the discussion would center on tariffs, advanced technology exports, and supply chain competition – key sticking points that have long defined the relationship between the two powers. Trump told reporters he believed the two sides could reach common ground. </p><p>After the talks, Trump said he and Xi had "an amazing meeting" and that both sides had reached "an outstanding group of decisions" on key economic and security issues. The president said Xi agreed to begin immediate purchases of U.S. soybeans and other farm goods and that China would work "very hard" to block fentanyl from entering the U.S.</p><p>Trump said he would cut the tariff rate on Chinese imports by 10 points – from 20% to 10%, according to his description – though an aide clarified that the rates would be closer to 45-47%, in response to Xi’s promise to crack down on the flow of fentanyl.</p><p>"I believe he’s going to work very hard to stop the death that’s coming in," Trump said.</p><p>The two sides also reached an understanding on rare earth exports, as China agreed to pause planned export controls for a year, Trump said. A senior administration official later clarified that both leaders agreed to revisit the agreement next year, and that the arrangement could be extended at that time.</p><p>The U.S. president also said he spoke to Xi about chip technology. He said China would be in discussions with Nvidia about additional semiconductor purchases but that the company's newest generation of advanced processors were not part of the conversation.</p><p>The president described the outcome of the deal as a one-year framework agreement aimed at being renewed annually.</p><p>"We have a deal," Trump said. "Every year we’ll renegotiate the deal, but I think it’ll go on for a long time."</p><p>Trump also said the administration announced plans for reciprocal visits, with the U.S. president traveling to China in April and Xi visiting the U.S. later this year.</p><p>The meeting, which lasted roughly an hour and forty minutes, concluded with a brief photo opportunity before the two leaders went their separate ways. Afterward, neither side released details about what was discussed. Trump departed Busan without taking questions, waving to the press pool as he climbed the steps to Air Force One. </p><p>As cameras clicked, Trump leaned toward Xi and appeared to speak quietly before shaking hands and boarding the plane. </p><p>Trump and Xi spoke briefly to the press before heading into a closed-door session for less than two hours with senior aides.</p><p>"It’s an honor to be with a friend of mine," Trump said of Xi, adding that while some issues remain unresolved, "I think we’ve already agreed to a lot of things."</p><p>Xi said in his opening remarks that "it feels very warm seeing you again because it’s been many years." </p><p>The Chinese leader acknowledged that occasional friction between major powers is natural, adding that the U.S. and China "can still find ways to thrive side by side." </p><p>Earlier aboard Air Force One en route to South Korea, Trump suggested he may reduce tariffs imposed on China due to Beijing's cooperation in curbing fentanyl exports.</p><p>"I expect to be lowering that because I believe that they’re going to help us with the fentanyl situation," Trump said, adding, "The relationship with China is very good."</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">JD Vance reveals why Christian values are key to America’s future during TPUSA tribute to Charlie Kirk</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Vice President JD Vance spoke at length during a large Turning Point USA gathering at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) in honor of Charlie Kirk, during which he shared the slain conservative activist's impact on his faith and told students that "a properly rooted Christian moral order" is key to the future of the country.</p><p>After the audience heard from Kirk's widow, Erika, Vance took the stage and spoke for a brief time before taking questions from the audience on a range of issues from immigration to National Guard deployments and the Second Amendment. But several of the questions revolved around Vance's faith and the impact it has had on how he governs as Vice President. Some asked about his views on religious liberty while another questioned how he was raising his family in a dual-religion household where his wife is Hindu.   </p><p>"I make no apologies for thinking that Christian values are an important foundation of this country," Vance said when responding to a question about the separation of church and state. "Anybody who's telling you their view is neutral likely has an agenda to sell you. And I'm at least honest about the fact that I think the Christian foundation of this country is a good thing."</p><p>Meanwhile, Vance railed against contemporary liberalism in his comments about faith Wednesday night, calling it a "perverted version of Christianity."  </p><p>"There's nothing wrong, of course, with focusing on people who are disenfranchised, for example. That's the focus of liberalism. But if you completely separate it from any religious duty or any civic virtue, then that can actually become, for example, an inducement to lawlessness," Vance said while responding to a questioner. "You can't just have compassion for the criminal. You also have to have justice too. Which is why I think that a properly rooted Christian moral order is such an important part of the future of our country."</p><p>Vance went on to say that he does not think God must be kicked out of the public square, adding he did not believe that is what the founders intended. </p><p>"Anybody who tells you it's required by the Constitution is lying to you," Vance argued. "What happened, is, the Supreme Court interpreted ‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion’ to effectively throw the church out of every public place at the federal, state and local level. I think it was a terrible mistake, and we're still paying for the consequences of it today."</p><p>In addition to taking tough policy-oriented questions about faith and religion, Vance was also asked at one point about living in an interfaith household. Vance's wife is Hindu. </p><p>Vance noted how when the pair met he was not a Christian, but over time he and his wife, Usha, decided to raise their boys Christian. Vance said open communication and respect for each other's beliefs played a part in his marriage and his family's decision to raise their kids Christian.   </p><p>"Most Sundays she will come with me to church. As I've told her, and I've said publicly, and I'll say now in front of 10,000 of my closest friends, ‘Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved in by church? Yeah, I honestly, I do wish that.’ Because I believe in the Christian gospel and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way. But if she doesn't, then God says everybody has free will, and so that doesn't cause a problem for me."</p><p>Vance also spoke about the impact Kirk has had on his faith during the Wednesday night event honoring the slain activist. Vance said that, at least in part, Kirk moved him to be more vocal about his faith.</p><p>"This is another way in which Charlie has affected my life – I would say that I grew up again in a generation where even if people had very deep personal faith, they didn't talk about their faith a whole lot," Vance told the crowd while remembering his late friend. </p><p>"But the reason why I try to be the best husband I can be, the best father I can be, the reason why I care so much about all the issues that we're going to talk about, is because I believe I've been placed in this position for a brief period of time to do the most amount of good for God and for the country that I love so much. And that's the most important way that my faith influences me."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Erika Kirk delivers raw, faith-filled tribute to late husband at Ole Miss: ‘I slept on his side of the bed’</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Erika Kirk walked onto the stage at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) Wednesday night to a packed house for her first Turning Point USA campus appearance since the murder of her husband, Charlie Kirk.</p><p>"It’s hard not to cry after watching," she said of the video tribute that played before she took the microphone. "I haven’t seen that... that video since that day happened."</p><p>"Being on campus right now for me is a spiritual reclaiming of territory," she said. "There is a lot of symbolism in today. It’s Wednesday, seven weeks. And the more that I am coming to grips with the permanency of this nightmare, the more that I am starting to realize and witness that the enemy, he doesn’t want you."</p><p>He wants your territory. He wants your influence. And I could just hear Charlie in my heart. I could hear him say, ‘Go reclaim that territory, babe. Go — the battles that God’s love conquers.’ And that’s why I’m here today," she added.</p><p>Erika thanked the students who filled the arena, many wearing 'Freedom' T-shirts like the one she wore at the podium. "You have no idea how helpful it is to have all of you in my life, because you help me feel even more deeply connected to my husband," she told them.</p><p>She recalled how Charlie made a point at every Turning Point USA event to stop and talk with student leaders. "He would ask you what your name is, what you’re studying, what issues are going on on campus," she said. "He wanted you to know he was investing in you: into your chapter, into your school. That was a pulse point for him.""Earn your voice," she urged. "You are the courageous generation. That’s what you are. All of you, Gen Z, you are the courageous generation. Make him proud."</p><p>"I lost my friend. I lost my best friend," she said. "If you’re nervous about standing up for the truth, the murder of my husband puts into perspective all those fears. My husband never went with the flow. He believed the harder path was always the right one, because comfort doesn’t change the world."</p><p>She shared for the first time with the audience present that for weeks after Charlie's murder she avoided their bedroom at home.</p><p>"It took me a while to even just make it back into our bedroom," she said. "I used to sprint from the opening door into the bathroom and sprint out. I was not ready to walk into our bedroom yet, and when I was finally able to sleep in our bed for the first time, I slept on his side of the bed."</p><p>From that spot, she said, she finally saw what Charlie saw every morning, the framed words on the wall: "They will be known by the boldness of their faith."</p><p>"He saw that every single morning he woke up," Erika said. "I didn’t, because I was on the other side, facing the window. But from his side, that’s what he saw first."</p><p>On his desk, she added, were three questions Charlie had written out and asked himself each day: "What is something I can do for someone today? What is something I can do to add value to the world today? How can I honor God today?"</p><p>"Those were his action points for courage," Erika said. "Ask yourself those questions every day, and I promise you, you will get courage. What death amplifies even more is that you only get one life. So live like it matters."</p><p>"Love your family fearlessly. Love your spouse fearlessly. Love this country," she said. "Defend her and serve our God. And don’t think that it’s someone else’s role to do it. You do it. You do it." The audience broke into applause.</p><p>"This moment can either be your breaking point or your wake-up call," she said. "Essentially, your turning point."</p><p>She then introduced Vice President JD Vance, a friend of her late husband, calling him someone who "understands the fight that we’re up against and can articulate that in a way that transcends race and background."</p><p>"There will never be another Charlie," she said, "but I know he’d be proud to see us here tonight."</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The legal team representing two boys suspended for questioning a transgender classmate’s access to the boys’ locker room have now filed an amended federal complaint alleging fresh factual claims and a new conspiracy charge, as they escalate their federal case against the Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS) in Virginia.</p><p>America First Legal and the Founding Freedoms Law Center, who are representing the boys and their families, added new factual allegations to their previously submitted federal complaint on Wednesday, alleging LCPS engaged in a conspiracy to retaliate against the boys. It also claimed there were alleged inconsistencies in the district's handling of its Title IX investigation that found the boys guilty of sexual harassment and suspended them for 10 days.   </p><p>"Loudoun County Public Schools’ Title IX investigation into our clients inexplicably relied on non-credible evidence, ignored credible witness testimony, failed to interview keywitnesses, deleted potentially exonerating video evidence, and failed to disclose LCPS’s own admission that the allegations against our clients did not constitute sexual harassment," said Ian Prior, Senior Counsel at America First Legal. </p><p>"Making matters worse, and as we set forth in the amended complaint, it appears that the school board was passing along confidential information to a political action committee for the purpose of further retaliating against our clients and their families. If proven true at trial, and we intend to do exactly that, this entire affair is a travesty of justice, a waste of taxpayer money to defend, and everything that is wrong with the Loudoun County School Board and its misplaced priorities."</p><p>Earlier this year, LCPS, located in Northern Virginia, launched a Title IX sexual harassment investigation into two high-school-aged boys after they were videotaped by a biological female who identified as transgender inside the boys' locker room. The video caught them outwardly complaining to each other about the fact that there was a biological girl who identified as a boy using their facilities.</p><p>Before taking the case to federal court, the boys and their parents sought to appeal LCPS's Title IX sexual harassment finding to keep the boys from being suspended or marked as sexual harassers on their permanent record. However, their appeal was ultimately denied by the district, leading the families to pursue action in federal court.</p><p>On Wednesday, the families turned up the heat with fresh allegations not laid out in their original complaint, including that the district conspired with a local political action committee, Loudoun for All, for the purpose of retaliating against the boys and their families. </p><p>The amended complaint also points to inconsistencies in the district's Title IX investigation, such as relying on non-credible evidence, ignoring credible evidence and witness testimony, misrepresenting evidence, failing to interview key witnesses, and failing to disclose potentially exonerating evidence. </p><p>The fresh complaint claims that days after the federal court issued a preliminary injunction halting LCPS from suspending the boys or making Title IX findings part of their student record, the district reached out to Loudoun For All and corroborated with them in a press release and other messaging materials that included "a number of false and defamatory allegations" used to generate a public narrative against the boys and their families. The press releases and other materials, such as a timeline of the case's events, were listed on the political action committee's website, Facebook page, Reddit account and Bluesky account, and allegedly also contained privileged, confidential information pertaining to the case cited in a subsequent local media report titled, "Locker Room Lawsuit Against LCPS Involves Misinformation, Loudoun4All Says." </p><p>The press release Loudoun For All put out accused the boys' parents of "orchestrat[ing] a coordinated campaign of disinformation, knowingly misrepresenting facts to fuel political outrage," and argued that they were trying to "inflame voters ahead of an election."</p><p>It also claimed that 24 witnesses corroborated that the boys' called the female student, who identifies as transgender, a "girl," "it," "girl-boy," and told them "get out" while inside the boy's locker room. But, according to the boys' legal counsel, witnesses never corroborated these claims and the female student's accusations of when the harassment took place appeared to be inconsistent.</p><p>Loudoun For All did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p><p>Meanwhile, the complaint also alleges that LCPS failed to disclose that a video cited as evidence in the district's Title IX finding against the boys included the female student saying "I got it" while laughing. It adds that the district allegedly deleted other video the female student took of boys using or coming out of the bathroom.</p><p>The amended complaint notes that despite inconsistencies in the female student's story at times, they were credited with "superior credibility" by Title IX investigators in the district. Furthermore, it claims that a threat assessment of the male students found no threat and the district had previously concluded that a situation similar to the one at hand resulted in the district finding no cause for a sexual harassment under federal law.   </p><p>LCPS declined to comment on the amended complaint, telling Fox News Digital that it is the district's practice not to comment on pending legal matters.</p><p>Shortly after LCPS denied the boys' Title IX appeal, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights found LCPS violated Title IX by discriminating against the boys on the basis of sex. Specifically, the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights determined LCPS "failed to meaningfully investigate complaints of sexual harassment by two male students concerning the presence of a member of the opposite sex in male-only intimate spaces yet thoroughly investigated the female student’s sexual harassment complaint about the boys."</p><p>Both of the boy's parents told Fox News Digital in August that their sons attempted to voice discomfort to school officials about the female classmate using their locker room, but that their complaints fell on deaf ears.   </p><p>The Trump administration indicated LCPS would lose federal funding if they did not rescind its suspensions and sexual harassment findings against the two boys, review its initial findings, and investigate the Title IX complaint the boys filed against the female student for videotaping them in the locker room, which the boys' attorneys say was ignored by the district.</p><p>"The amended complaint we filed today unveils Loudoun County Public Schools' sham targeting of these boys while it ignored numerous, credible threats to their privacy and safety," said Victoria Cobb, President of the Founding Freedoms Law Center. "As alleged, a female student repeatedly filmed male students, including while using the bathroom, yet Loudoun did nothing. Instead, Loudoun appears to have conspired with an outside political organization to continue its attacks against these boys and their parents."</p><p>The Trump administration has also included LCPS among a list of five Northern Virginia school districts in violation of Title IX due to their locker room and bathroom policies. As a result of that determination, the districts' federal funding will now be "done by reimbursement only" and the Trump administration commenced proceedings to potentially terminate their funding altogether, the Education Department indicated over the summer. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump says US will restart nuclear weapons tests, blames rivals’ actions after Xi meeting</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump announced that he has ordered the United States to resume nuclear weapons testing "immediately," saying he directed the Department of War to match other nations’ programs. He called the move a necessary step to maintain global parity.</p><p>Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Wednesday night: "The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country. This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office."</p><p>"Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years," Trump said. "Because of other countries’ testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately."</p><p>Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One after a high-stakes meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Trump said it was a response to other nations’ recent actions.</p><p>"It had to do with others — they seemed to all be nuclear testing. We have more nuclear weapons than anybody. We don’t do testing. We halted it many years ago, but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also," Trump said.</p><p>Trump declined to provide details on where and when testing might take place when pressed for the information.</p><p>"It’ll be announced. You know, we have test sites. It’ll be announced," he said.</p><p>Trump also said he did not believe that resuming U.S. nuclear tests could make the global environment more dangerous.</p><p>"I don’t think so. I think we have it pretty well locked up," he said. "But we have more than anybody, and I see them testing. I say, well, they’re testing, we have to test too. I’d like to see a deneutralization … because we have so many. Russia’s second and China’s third. China will catch up within four or five years. I think de-escalation, or denuclearization, would be tremendous. We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something."</p><p>The announcement comes days after Trump warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that the U.S. has a nuclear submarine stationed "right off their shores." The warning followed Russia’s recent missile tests.</p><p>Trump made the comments during a conversation with reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday morning, saying the U.S. is "not playing games" with Putin.</p><p>"Russia said this week that they’ve tested a new missile that can go more than 8,000 miles. Is that saber-rattling for you? What is that?" a reporter asked.</p><p>"I know we have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores. So, I mean, it doesn’t have to go 8,000 miles, and they’re not playing games with us. We’re not playing games with them either," Trump responded.</p><p>"We test missiles all the time. But, you know, we do have a submarine, a nuclear submarine. We don’t need to go 8,000 miles. And I don’t think it’s an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying either, by the way. You ought to get the war ended. A war that should have taken one week is now in its soon [to be] fourth year. That’s what you ought to do instead of testing missiles," he added.</p><p>Trump later hinted he may impose additional sanctions on Russia, telling reporters simply, "You'll find out."</p><p>Russia’s defense ministry said Sunday it successfully tested a nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile, claiming it can travel more than 8,000 miles and pierce defense systems. Putin said Russia is moving to deploy the weapon.</p><p>Russia’s top general, Valery Gerasimov, told Putin the missile traveled 8,700 miles and remained airborne for about 15 hours during its October 21 test.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Anders Hagstrom, Christina Shaw and Reuters contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pushed back Wednesday at a local NBC News affiliate's report on an arrested illegal immigrant in California.</p><p>On Saturday, NBC Bay Area reported that federal agents arrested 42-year-old Gerardo in San Jose as he was leaving for work.</p><p>"According to the family’s Ring video, Gerardo was in his black truck at 7:45 a.m., about to head out to his construction job when multiple people, who appear to be federal officers, approached his truck and yelled for him to get out," the report read.</p><p>It continued, "His wife, Idalia, who says she is a U.S citizen, ran to the truck to try to stop the arrest. She said a woman, not in uniform, hit her 22-year-old daughter with a baton - the incident, however, is not shown on the footage."</p><p>DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, however, wrote on X that the local affiliate did not report the full details on the arrested suspect.</p><p>"Of course @NBCNews refuses to tell the American public that this illegal alien from Mexico has a rap sheet that includes: lewd and lascivious acts with a CHILD, battery of a spouse, domestic battery, compensation for prostitution, felony reentry after removal," McLaughlin wrote.</p><p>In a longer statement to Fox News Digital, McLaughlin confirmed that ICE officers arrested Gerardo Rojas-Leyva, an illegal immigrant from Mexico with a history of battery. McLaughlin said that Rojas-Leyva did not provide identification and resisted arrest, forcing an officer to deploy a taser and handcuff him.</p><p>"Rojas-Leyva’s criminal history includes lewd and lascivious acts with child of 14-15 years old, battery of a spouse, inflicting corporal injury on a spouse/cohabitant, and proving compensation for prostitution," McLaughlin said. "Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, if you break the law, you will face the consequences. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to NBC for comment.</p><p>McLaughlin previously attacked NBC over a report that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents used a 5-year-old girl with autism to pressure her father, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala, to surrender. She called the report a "disgusting smear" of ICE agents.</p><p>"Keep in mind, these men and women of ICE are fathers and mothers, and they are sons and daughters. These are people who just want to go home to their families at night and serve our great nation," McLaughlin said on "Fox &amp; Friends."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Louisiana governor asserts control over LSU's football coaching search after Brian Kelly's dismissal</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry declared Wednesday that LSU athletic director Scott Woodward would be stripped of his authority in the school’s search for its next head football coach.</p><p>LSU is pursuing a new football coach after deciding this week to part ways with Brian Kelly. Woodward announced Kelly’s departure Sunday, one day after the Tigers’ 49-25 loss to Texas A&amp;M. </p><p>Kelly left Notre Dame after the 2021 season and spent fewer than four full seasons in Baton Rouge.</p><p>"We had high hopes that he would lead us to multiple SEC and national championships during his time in Baton Rouge," Woodward said in the announcement. "Ultimately, the success at the level that LSU demands simply did not materialize, and I made the decision to make a change after last night's game."</p><p>LSU continues to finalize Kelly’s $54 million buyout, a figure that Landry has criticized.</p><p>"We are not going down a failed path," Landry said Wednesday during a news conference. "The guy that's here now that wrote that contract cost Texas A&amp;M $77 million. Right now, we've got a $53 million liability. We are not doing that again."</p><p>The $77 million figure Landry mentioned was a reference to former Texas A&amp;M coach Jimbo Fisher, whom Woodward hired and whose contract negotiations he oversaw. According to multiple reports, private donors could be tapped to cover some of the costs of Kelly's buyout, which could be further offset if Kelly lands another coaching job. </p><p>Woodward has served as LSU’s athletic director since 2019. The school paid Ed Orgeron a buyout of more than $17 million after his dismissal in 2021.</p><p>"No. I can tell you right now, Scott Woodward is not selecting the next coach," Landry said. "I'll let [President] Donald Trump select him before I let him do it."</p><p>The Republican governor added, "The Board of Supervisors are going to come up with a committee, and they're going to find us a coach." </p><p>Members of the board are appointed by the governor.</p><p>Fox News Digital contacted the LSU athletic department for comment but did not receive an immediate response.</p><p>Landry made it clear the Tigers' next coach would be "compensated properly." He did, however, call for placing "metrics" on the deal.</p><p>"I'm tired of rewarding failure in this country," the governor said.</p><p>Landry also confirmed that he participated in talks about a coaching change leading up to Kelly's removal.</p><p>"My role is about the fiscal effect of firing a coach under a terrible contract," he said Wednesday. "All I care about is what the taxpayers are going to be on the hook for."</p><p>Despite LSU's efforts to boost funding to pay transfer portal players, Kelly largely failed to meet expectations of competing for a national championship.</p><p>LSU is on a bye week; Alabama hosts the Tigers Nov. 8.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo warned Wednesday that President Donald Trump would try to "take over" the city if Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral race.</p><p>"If Mamdani wins, you are going to see Trump come in here and take over New York City. You mark my words," Cuomo said on "Straight Shooter with Stephen A."</p><p>When pressed by host Stephen A. Smith, the former New York governor argued that the federal government "controls everything" and could close airports and "basically bankrupt" the city under the Trump administration.</p><p>After Trump recently suggested he plans to "send more than the National Guard" to help with crime in Democrat-led cities like New York City, Cuomo said Trump would be motivated to do even more with Mamdani in charge.</p><p>"You know, President Trump needs an excuse to act, right?" Cuomo said. "He doesn't just send the National Guard. He sends the National Guard as a power play. He's making a statement: 'These Democrats don't know how to run a city. They're dangerous, these Democrats. I have to send in the National Guard to take care of the people in Portland and take care of the people in LA because the Democrats don't know what they're doing.'</p><p>"He needs that hook to do it. Mamdani gives him that hook on steroids. He'll send the National Guard, he'll send ICE. He'll say that he personally has to have his administration oversee the city because you have an incompetent 34-year-old socialist."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Mamdani's campaign for comment.</p><p>Cuomo gave a similar warning on ABC's "The View" earlier this month, suggesting that Trump is hoping Mamdani wins the election.</p><p>"He wants Mamdani for two reasons. One, going into the midterms, he will take a picture of Mamdani, run around the country and say, ‘Here is what happened to the Democrats. They are now communists. They hate the police. They legalize prostitution, legalize drugs. They want to elect this Democrat, no experience whatsoever — being mayor of New York would be his first real job,'" he said.</p><p>According to a Quinnipiac University survey, Mamdani holds a 10-point lead against Cuomo in the mayoral race, down from a 13-point lead earlier this month.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth announced the U.S. military on Wednesday struck another boat carrying people he claims were narco-terrorists.</p><p>The strikes were carried out in the Eastern Pacific region at the direction of President Donald Trump, killing four men on board, according to Hegseth.</p><p>The military "carried out a lethal kinetic strike on yet another narco-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) in the Eastern Pacific," Hegseth wrote on X.</p><p>"This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics," he said. "Four male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel — and killed — during the strike, which was conducted in international waters. No U.S. forces were harmed in this strike."</p><p>"The Western Hemisphere is no longer a safe haven for narco-terrorists bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans," Hegseth added. "The Department of War will continue to hunt them down and eliminate them wherever they operate."</p><p>This is the 14th strike on suspected drug boats carried out since September. A total of 61 have reportedly been killed while three survived, including at least two who were later repatriated to their home countries.</p><p>The Pentagon has refused to release the identities of those killed or evidence of drugs on board.</p><p>The Trump administration has been scrutinized in recent weeks over the strikes, including by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who raised concerns about killing people without due process and the possibility of killing innocent people.</p><p>Paul has cited Coast Guard statistics that show a significant percentage of boats boarded for suspicion of drug trafficking are innocent.</p><p>The senator has also argued that if the administration plans to engage in a war with Venezuela after it has targeted boats it claims are transporting drugs for the Venezuela-linked Tren de Aragua gang, it must seek a declaration of war from Congress.</p><p>Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee also penned a letter Wednesday demanding to review the legal justification behind the series of boat strikes they say appear to violate several laws.</p><p>"Drug trafficking is a terrible crime that has had devastating impacts on American families and communities and should be prosecuted. Nonetheless, the President’s actions to hold alleged drug traffickers accountable must still conform with the law," the letter states.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Major blue county in hot seat after violent illegal alien arrested 10 times finally nabbed by ICE</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> Fairfax County officials are in the hot seat after the Trump Department of Homeland Security says the county's sanctuary policies allowed an illegal alien to walk free despite having been arrested ten times and having 19 criminal charges, including for malicious shooting and unlawful wounding.</p><p>The top Fairfax County official is disputing DHS' characterization of it as a sanctuary county. However, Salvadoran national Jorge Armando Melendez-Gonzalez, 27, was arrested 10 times and has been charged with 19 different crimes in just over seven years, between March 19, 2018, and July 18, 2025, according to DHS.</p><p>He was finally arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Oct. 24 after DHS said officials at the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center declined to honor an immigration detainer it lodged against him on July 18.</p><p>The July detainer was not the first time Fairfax County ignored an ICE request to hold Melendez-Gonzalez. ICE also lodged a detainer against him in 2023. According to DHS, "Fairfax County officials refused to honor the immigration detainer and released this dangerous criminal alien back into the community."</p><p>The agency said Melendez-Gonzalez entered the U.S. illegally in June 2015. An immigration judge ordered his removal from the country just over a year later in October 2016.</p><p>Despite this, Melendez-Gonzalez stayed in the country for just over ten years, racking up a long list of offenses in Virginia. He has arrests for three counts of malicious shooting, unlawful wounding, use of a firearm in commission of a felony, assault and battery, assault on a family member, grand larceny, trespassing, possessing a false government identification, public intoxication, disturbing the peace and making a false statement to a law enforcement officer.</p><p>He has two felony convictions for unlawful wounding stemming from a 2023 shooting, which carry sentences of three years in confinement. However, his sentence was reduced to a year.</p><p>According to a statement from the Fairfax County Police Department, detectives arrested Melendez-Gonzalez in August 2023 in a shooting that injured three men outside a business in Falls Church, Virginia.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Fairfax County Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, a Democrat, for the reason for Melendez-Gonzalez’s sentence being suspended. A spokesperson for the commonwealth’s attorney’s office declined to comment, referring Fox News Digital to the Fairfax County Sheriff’s Office, which, the spokesperson said, "is responsible for handling ICE detainers."</p><p>Allyson Conroy, a spokesperson for the sheriff's office, which runs the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center, told Fox News Digital, "We did not have a judicial warrant on file from ICE for Jorge Armando Melendez-Gonzalez for either date, Aug. 28, 2023, nor for July 18 of this year."</p><p>Conroy said "the sheriff’s office could not maintain custody over Mr. Melendez-Gonzalez."</p><p>Regarding the suspension of Melendez-Gonalez’s sentence, Conroy said that decision "is in the discretion of the judge or the assigned commonwealth’s attorney. You should contact those individuals for further information."</p><p>Fox News Digital also reached out to representatives for Fairfax County regarding the Fairfax County Circuit Court’s decision but did not immediately receive a response.</p><p>Fairfax County Chairman Jeffrey McKay, also a Democrat, responded to Fox News Digital’s request for comment, saying, "Fairfax County, through the Board of Supervisors, does not control or make decisions regarding ICE detainers or judicial sentencing; those responsibilities fall to the sheriff and the courts, respectively."</p><p>He said Fairfax County "does not consider itself a sanctuary jurisdiction and continues to follow all applicable federal and state laws."</p><p>DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, however, placed the blame squarely on the county’s sanctuary policies.</p><p>"These sanctuary policies make Virginians less safe," McLaughlin told Fox News Digital.</p><p>"Fairfax County refused to honor two ICE arrest detainers and chose to release this criminal back onto Virginia’s streets. Virginia sanctuary politicians protected this criminal illegal alien and allowed him to terrorize American citizens," she added.</p><p>"Thanks to the brave men and women of ICE law enforcement, this serial violent criminal with 10 previous arrests is now off of Virginia’s streets."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Department of Veterans Affairs said the federal government shutdown has forced nearly 37,000 employees to be furloughed or work without pay.  </p><p>The department’s medical centers, outpatient clinics and veterans centers remain open and are operating normally during the shutdown because of advanced appropriations from Congress, the agency said. </p><p>"The Democrats’ government shutdown is limiting services for veterans and making life miserable for VA employees, and things are only going to get worse as time goes on," said VA Secretary Doug Collins. </p><p>"It’s time for Democrats to stop using the suffering of Americans as political leverage to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants.</p><p>"I call on them to open the government and enable VA to provide the complete and comprehensive services America’s veterans, families, caregivers and survivors have earned," he added. </p><p>Despite some services still being offered, others have stopped. </p><p>A news release said more than 900,000 veterans are unable to get assistance from the GI Bill hotline, which has shut down, and 100,000 enrolled veterans cannot get Veteran Readiness and Employment program counseling or case management services because employees from those departments have been furloughed.</p><p>In addition, 56 VA regional benefits offices are closed to the public.</p><p>More than 16,000 service members who are preparing to leave the military can't receive VA transition briefings because the contract that provides for this service is not operational during the lapse in appropriations. And 157 VA national cemeteries across the country are no longer doing maintenance or placing permanent headstones.</p><p>However, burials will also continue at VA national cemeteries.</p><p>VA benefit claims continue to be processed and delivered, including compensation, pension, education and housing benefits, the agency said. </p><p>Republicans have blamed Democrats for the ongoing shutdown, accusing them of prioritizing healthcare for illegal immigrants over taxpayers. Democrats say GOP leaders need to negotiate a bipartisan deal that also protects people from a spike in healthcare costs.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>North Carolina Tar Heels head football coach Bill Belichick used one of President Donald Trump’s famous lines to slam a report against his program. </p><p>During a recent news conference, Belichick was asked by a reporter whether he felt his UNC program was heading in a new direction since he released a statement maintaining that he is committed to the program despite a report stating school brass was discussing a potential buyout during his 2-5 campaign. </p><p>Belichick, whose Tar Heels narrowly lost to No. 15 Virginia over the weekend, fired back. </p><p>"It’s never been anything but that," he said, referencing the efforts of his players. </p><p>"Whoever that story came from, it’s already been taken down and everything else. It’s just total — as Trump would say — fake news. It’s just a novel.

<div class="article-title">Sia's estranged husband denied sole custody of son after he accused musician of drug abuse in emergency order</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A judge denied Sia's estranged husband an emergency custody request for their 19-month-old son Somersault (Summi) as part of their ongoing divorce, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital.</p><p>Dr. Daniel Bernad filed the request earlier this week, asking the court to grant him "sole legal and physical custody" of their son due to the "Chandelier" singer's alleged "reckless" conduct. He also accused Sia of being "an unfit and unreliable parent struggling with substance abuse and addiction." </p><p>The musician fired back that Summi never spent more than "two hours in Dan's presence" without Sia and claimed the initial "restrictive, agreed-upon arrangements" established in August for their son were due to Bernad's involvement in an investigation regarding alleged "illicit child pornography found on his computer hard drive."</p><p>On Wednesday, the court found "that sufficient exigency for the requested emergency relief has not been shown at this time," documents state. </p><p>"The parties entered into a stipulated legal custody and interim physical custody arrangement on August 1, 2025. Most of the facts asserted in Respondent's RFO were known at that time. The ex parte RFO is denied without prejudice. It may be resubmitted on the Court's regular RFO calendar."</p><p>Representatives for the estranged couple did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p><p>In Bernad's emergency request, the oncologist claimed his estranged wife deliberately and repeatedly concealed "that she was hospitalized for two weeks in September" during a time when she was supposed to be in Italy with their son. </p><p>"She tested positive for barbiturates and benzodiazepines, with no legitimate medical explanation," he claimed. "She unilaterally and unlawfully transferred written power of attorney over Summi to her nannies in direct violation of our joint legal custody agreement."</p><p>He alleged, "Sia is an unfit and unreliable parent struggling with substance abuse and addiction, rendering her incapable of providing safe or stable care for Summi. I am the only safe and reliable parent for our son. I am a doctor, young, healthy, and have no criminal history or drug or alcohol addiction issues. I request that the Court grant my Ex Parte to protect Summi from further harm and to guarantee that he is safe, secure and properly cared for."</p><p>Bernad claimed he witnessed Sia abuse "ketamine and other drugs" during their relationship. She allegedly purchased $20,000 worth of ketamine during a trip to Egypt and claimed she was "too famous and rich to ever get arrested." </p><p>In another alleged incident, Bernad claimed he discovered Sia on the ground in her bedroom with "approximately $15,000 of ketamine in her pockets."  </p><p>The doctor also asked for more than $77,000 per month in child support and for Sia to be fiscally responsible for all childcare costs.</p><p>In a response filed to her estranged husband's request, the "Unstoppable" singer claimed she's been sober for over six months and has "repeatedly agreed to drug testing."</p><p>She acknowledged that the Los Angeles Police Department's investigation into claims Bernad had child pornography on a hard drive was deemed "inconclusive" and "unfounded." As of Oct. 2, the case had been closed/suspended due to no evidence of a crime.</p><p>Sia filed for divorce from Bernad in March after two years of marriage, citing "irreconcilable differences." </p><p>"Since filing the Petition in March 2025, Sia has paid Dan approximately $300,000 including $100,000 in May, $50,000 per month since August, and covering five months of his hotel accommodations and psychotherapy and other expenses," she wrote. </p><p>"Dan’s attempt to weaponize my past sobriety journey – an issue long resolved and well-documented – serves no legitimate purpose and is intended only to distort the facts and undermine my credibility before this Court. His willingness to dredge up decades-old history to serve his own financial and strategic interests demonstrates the extent to which he will go, even at the expense of his child and the child’s mother."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>An associate dean at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has publicly called former President Donald Trump a racist and co-authored an academic paper suggesting the American education system, and even mathematics, is "inherently violent" toward Black students.</p><p>Percival Matthews, associate dean for the Office of the Dean and a professor in the Human Development Area at UW–Madison, shared his views in a series of Facebook posts and academic writings reviewed by Fox News Digital.</p><p>In a January 2018 Facebook post, Matthews appeared to label Trump a racist, writing, "What’s on my mind? This: When you get a guy in the ultimate seat of power with a history of racist endeavors who makes not-even-veiled racist comments that a decent portion of the people continue to defend, you’re left wondering what’s left to do."</p><p>He continued by invoking Malcolm X, saying, "For many, the name Malcolm X evokes the image of an unnecessarily violent man who hated America. But if you actually read the text of his best speeches (I recommend The Ballot or the Bullet as a starter), it’s clear that the frustration was fueled by a bald-faced (look the origin of that term up too) denial of an undeniable and obvious truth."</p><p>Matthews, who was appointed "special advisor for access and community" in April, a role that "recognizes the importance of advancing UW–Madison’s institutional efforts to create a welcoming and inclusive community for students and employees from every background," has also made reference to the concept of "violence" in education.</p><p>In a paper co-authored with Pooja Sidney, an associate professor at the University of Kentucky, Matthews claimed that systemic inequities in education leave Black students "shut out" of advanced courses, particularly in mathematics.</p><p>"This exclusionary narrative continues into the higher grades, with Black children routinely being shut out of advanced mathematics courses despite meeting achievement standards," the paper states. "In stark contrast, more privileged White children are sometimes tracked into advanced courses despite failing to meet those standards."</p><p>The paper goes on to ask, "How can a Black scholar work to improve a system through rigorous empirical research when that system is arguably inherently violent toward Black children, even the ones who excel at all the tests?"</p><p>In an older Facebook post from 2020, Matthews referenced the concept of violence after the death of George Floyd, writing, "A legitimate (adv) use of violence can legitimate (vb) use of violence. There are a number of ways to read that sentence" in response to the murder of George Floyd.</p><p>Another 2020 post rhetorically asked, "And people are surprised that Minneapolis is burning?"</p><p>In a statement to Fox News Digital, John Lucas, assistant vice chancellor for public affairs and institutional communications at UW–Madison, wrote, "UW-Madison supports free expression and doesn’t comment on the personal social media accounts of its students, faculty or staff."</p><p>A statement from the University of Kentucky's office of public relations and strategic communications told Fox News Digital, "The university wouldn’t have any comment on a faculty member’s scholarly work, which is protected by academic freedom and does not represent any university stance."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Matthews and Sidney for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Giants star Dexter Lawrence disputes team legend's claim NFL players don't respect him anymore: 'Delusional'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A New York Giants star is firing back at a team legend’s criticism of his play this season. </p><p>Carl Banks, one of the team’s best defensive players of all time, recently called out Lawrence, saying no one in the league respects him anymore. </p><p>Banks said he has a rapport with Lawrence, but a scathing performance statement like that, even from a team legend, doesn’t usually sit well. </p><p>Lawrence was asked about what Banks said at his locker Wednesday, and as you’d expect, he didn’t appreciate it. </p><p>"He’s delusional," Lawrence replied, per the New York Post. "His words are delusional."</p><p>Perhaps Banks was trying to motivate the Giants' star defensive tackle, but Lawrence doesn’t view it that way at all. </p><p>"Let’s say this. I hope people start trying to disrespect me. Let’s say that," he said. </p><p>"I hope they start not respect me because that’s not what’s showing on the field. They’re showing a lot of respect on the field."</p><p>The respect Lawrence is talking about refers to the double teams he consistently gets on game day, and that’s not at all uncommon throughout his Giants tenure. Lawrence is arguably one of the best at his position in the NFL, and it usually takes more than one man to stop him from getting into the backfield. </p><p>"I get a lot of attention," he noted. "Check the numbers."</p><p>The numbers, though, are what Banks and others in the Giants’ fan base are looking at with Lawrence this season. The three-time Pro Bowler had nine sacks last season and 44 combined tackles over 12 games. </p><p>This year, Lawrence had just a half sack with 20 combined tackles in eight games. He did record an interception in Week 4 against the Los Angeles Chargers, while also batting three pass attempts down at the line of scrimmage. Another telling stat is only having four quarterback hits and six total pressures, which is unlike Lawrence.   </p><p>"I think I’m playing well, yes," Lawrence said. "Those are strong words, but that’s how he feels. F--- it."</p><p>Banks said on X he is critical of all players on his former team, and that sentiment carried through in a response to the Post as well. </p><p>"I love Dex and will continue to support him and his teammates publicly," he said. "I wish them great success. He remains my favorite Giant. As I stated on my @BleavNetwork pod, in order to get out of the current mess, he and they will have to ask more of themselves. I have been, in my opinion, fair in my critiques, my observations as well as complementary of not just him but others as well. I do publicly weekly. </p><p>"If he is unhappy with me, I am OK with that. It won’t change how I feel about him. Hopefully, they will collectively ask more of themselves and finish strong."</p><p>The Giants, now 2-6 after a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, will be back at MetLife Stadium to take on the San Francisco 49er Sunday. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">America’s quietest crop is set to take center stage in Trump-Xi talks</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>As President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping prepare to meet Thursday, one soft-spoken U.S. export star will take center stage: soybeans. </p><p>The humble crop, a $30 billion pillar of U.S. agriculture exports, has become a powerful symbol of the economic interdependence and political tension between Washington and Beijing. </p><p>In short, soybeans have come to embody the volatility of the U.S.–China trade war. Beijing halted purchases of American soybeans in response to Trump’s earlier tariffs on Chinese goods. </p><p>China pivoted to suppliers in Brazil and Argentina, a move that underscored how quickly global trade patterns can shift and how vulnerable U.S. farmers are to diplomatic rifts between Washington and Beijing.</p><p>What began as tit-for-tat posturing between the world’s two largest economies has turned into a symbolic and economic gut punch for Trump’s rural base, whose livelihoods depend on the very trade ties now caught in the crossfire.</p><p>According to the American Soybean Association, the U.S. has traditionally served as China’s leading soybean source. Prior to the 2018 trade conflict, roughly 28% of U.S. soybean production was exported to China. Those crop exports fell sharply to 11% in 2018 and 2019, recovered to 31% by 2021 amid pandemic-era demand and eased back to 22% in 2024.</p><p>But some policy experts argue that China’s shift away from U.S. soybeans was already underway.</p><p>"China was always going to reduce its reliance on the United States for food security," Bryan Burack, a senior policy advisor for China and the Indo-Pacific at the Heritage Foundation told Fox News Digital. "China started signing purchase agreements with other countries for soybeans well before President Trump took office." </p><p>He added that Beijing has "been decoupling from the U.S. for a long time."</p><p>"Unfortunately, the only way for us to respond is to do the same, and that process is painful and excruciating," Burack said.</p><p>But for farmers thousands of miles from Washington and Beijing, those policy shifts translate into shrinking markets and tighter margins.</p><p>"We rely on trade with other countries, specifically China, to buy our soybeans," Brad Arnold, a multigenerational soybean farmer in southwestern Missouri, told FOX Business. He said China's decision to boycott U.S. soybean purchases "has huge impacts on our business and our bottom line."</p><p>"There are domestic uses for soybeans, looking at renewable diesel, biodiesel specifically produced from soybeans," Arnold said. "In the grand scheme of things, that's such a small percentage currently, you know it's going to take a customer like China to buy beans to make a noticeable impact. You can't take our No. 1 customer, shut them off and just overnight find a replacement."</p><p>That reliance on China adds new weight to the diplomatic stage this week as Trump and Xi prepare to meet in South Korea. The two leaders will meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Busan, South Korea, marking their first in-person talks since Trump’s return to office. </p><p>Ahead of the meeting, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expected China to delay rare earth restrictions and resume U.S. soybean purchases, calling it part of a "substantial framework" both sides aim to maintain. Bessent also said that trade negotiations were moving toward averting a fresh 100% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods.</p><p>And in a possible gesture of easing tensions, Reuters reported that China bought around 180,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans in the run-up to Trump and Xi's meeting.</p><p>Whether it marks a true thaw in U.S.–China trade relations or just a temporary reprieve, the purchase underscores how deeply intertwined diplomacy and agriculture remain.</p><p><i>Fox Business' Eric Revell contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Hollywood producer sentenced Wednesday for the deaths of two women who were drugged and dumped at Los Angeles hospitals was also previously accused by a deceased police officer of rape.</p><p>Lauren Craven, 25, of La Mesa, California, was one of seven women who said David Pearce raped them, the New York Post reported. The revelation came in court as Pearce received a 146-year prison sentence for the 2021 deaths of model Christy Giles, 24, and Hilda Marcela Cabrales-Arzola, 26.</p><p>Craven was struck and killed by a vehicle last week as she tried to help people trapped in an overturned car on a freeway.</p><p>Los Angeles County prosecutors revealed the information about Craven’s allegations as a judge handed down Pearce’s sentence.</p><p>Craven died just two weeks after her 25th birthday. She was returning to La Mesa from the San Diego Central Jail when she came upon a collision on Interstate 8, according to the La Mesa Police Department.</p><p>"After exiting her vehicle to assist, she was tragically struck and killed by another motorist," the police department said in a Facebook post. "Officer Craven’s actions in her final moments exemplified her unwavering dedication to service and the safety of others — a reflection of how she lived every day."</p><p>Craven had been identified only as "Jane Doe No. 5" during Pearce’s trial, the Post reported. Pearce faced charges not only for the fatal druggings but also in connection with seven rape victims — spanning from 2007 to 2021 — who came forward after his arrest, according to prosecutors.</p><p>On Nov. 13, 2021, Giles and Cabrales-Arzola met Pearce, along with Brandt Osborne and Michael Ansbach, at a warehouse party in East Los Angeles, police said. They later returned to Pearce’s nearby home, where he provided GHB — commonly known as a "date rape drug" — and fentanyl to the group.</p><p>Several hours later, the women were captured on surveillance video being dropped off at separate hospitals by masked men driving a car with no license plates, according to prosecutors.</p><p>Giles was pronounced dead after staff members found her body outside Southern California Hospital in Culver City. Cabrales-Arzola was resuscitated after being dropped off 2 miles away at Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Hospital, where she died 11 days later.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Julia Bonavita and Sarah Rumpf-Whitten contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Colin Farrell admitted that Tom Cruise "was not happy" with him during the filming of their 2002 movie "Minority Report."</p><p>During an appearance Tuesday on "The Stephen Colbert Show," the 49-year-old actor recalled that the science-fiction action thriller was one of his first major Hollywood movies, and he was thrilled to be working with Cruise, now 63, and director Steven Spielberg.</p><p>However, Farrell, who was battling alcoholism and substance abuse problems at the time, told Colbert he had a wild night out on his birthday and showed up to the set hungover.</p><p>"I had one of the worst days I’ve ever had on a film set," the "Phone Booth" star shared. "It was my birthday on May 31, and we were shooting. And I begged production — who did I think I was? — of a $120 million film if they [could] not have me working on my birthday.</p><p>"So, of course, my pickup was 6 a.m. on May 31, and I got up to all sorts of nonsense the night before. And I remember getting into bed, and as soon as I turned off the light the phone rang, and it was the driver [who] said, ‘It'’s 10 past 6.’ And I went, ‘Oh, s---.'"</p><p>Farrell recalled that the first assistant director David H. Venghaus Jr. met him when he arrived at the shoot and immediately told him, "You can’t go to the set like this.'"</p><p>"And I went, ‘Just get me six Pacifico cervezas and a packet of 20 [Marlboro] Red,'" he said as the audience laughed.</p><p>"Now, listen, it’s not cool because two years later I went to rehab, right?" Farrell said to more laughter from the crowd.</p><p>"But it worked in the moment," he continued. "All the holy people that we look to on how to live a life would say the present is all that counts."</p><p>The Oscar nominee remembered that he drank "a couple of beers" before heading to the set.</p><p>"It was terrible," Farrell admitted.</p><p>"I will never forget the line I had that I couldn’t get out. It was, ‘I’m sure you’ve all grasped the fundamental paradox of pre-crime methodology.’ That was the line that started the scene," he recalled.</p><p>"I remember one of [the crew] coming up and saying, ‘Do you want to go out and take a breath of fresh air?’" Farrell continued. "And I remember thinking, ‘If I go out and take a breath of fresh air, then I’ll be under more pressure when I come back in to be better.’ And I went, ‘No, we’ll just go through it.'</p><p>"We did 46 takes," Farrell said. "Tom wasn’t very happy with me. Tom, who I love, was not very happy."</p><p>"Minority Report" was based on famed science fiction writer Philip K. Dick's 1956 short story of the same name. Set in Washington, D.C. in 2054, the movie followed Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), who works for a police unit that arrests people for crimes before they commit them by using the visions of three psychics called "pre-cogs."</p><p>Farrell portrayed Danny Witwer, a skeptical Justice Department agent sent to audit the Pre-Crime program. When the system predicts that Anderton will commit a murder, he goes on the run to prove his innocence. He later kidnaps the most powerful of the psychics, Agatha, played by Samantha Morton. Together, they work to uncover the truth about the program.</p><p>"Minority Report" was both a critical and commercial success, making $358 million at the worldwide box office.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg reaffirmed his support for Andrew Cuomo on social media Wednesday, saying the former New York governor’s experience and toughness make him the best choice to lead New York City as voters begin casting early ballots.</p><p>Bloomberg said on X, "Four months ago I endorsed @AndrewCuomo because I thought his management experience and government know-how made him the best choice for New Yorkers. I still do. And today, with early voting underway, I wanted to reiterate my support for Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>"Being Mayor of New York City is the second toughest job in America, and the next mayor will face immense challenges.</p><p>"Andrew Cuomo has the experience and toughness to stand up for New Yorkers and get things done. I hope you will join me in supporting him."</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Cuomo's campaign for comment on the matter.</p><p>Bloomberg, who served three terms as mayor, first endorsed Cuomo two weeks before New York City’s June 24 primary, just four days before early voting began.</p><p>At the time, Bloomberg said he cares "deeply about the future of our city, and since leaving office, it has been difficult to watch its struggles, especially since the pandemic. In sizing up the field in the race for mayor, there is one candidate whose management experience and government know-how stand above the others: Andrew Cuomo."</p><p>With just over a week until Election Day, state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani holds a double-digit, 10-point lead in the race for mayor of New York City, though Cuomo is narrowing the gap, according to the latest public polling.</p><p>Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist state lawmaker from Queens, shocked the political world in June by defeating Cuomo and nine other candidates to win the Democratic nomination.

<div class="article-title">'Squad' Dem dishes out campaign cash to anti-Israel nonprofit tied to 'Terrorist University'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>: The campaign for "Squad" Rep. Ilhan Omar recently sent over a thousand dollars to a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that partnered with a Palestinian university with alleged terrorist ties, according to new Federal Election Commission filings reviewed by Fox News Digital.</p><p>The Palestine House of Freedom, also known by its Arabic name, "Dar Alhurriya," is a nonprofit headquartered just blocks from the U.S. Capitol building. </p><p>According to a video on the group’s website, it is "dedicated to the liberation of Palestine" and "the dismantling of apartheid in Palestine and the establishment of a free, democratic state from the river to the sea."</p><p>The group’s website emphasizes that Israel is "operating as an apartheid state." The website further states that its mission is to "embark on an aggressive educational campaign targeting everyone from lawmakers, staffers, the media, to the general public" to "show how dismantling apartheid and establishing a free democratic Palestine from the River to the Sea with equal rights, is the path to peace and will benefit all parties involved."</p><p>The filings show that Omar’s campaign, Ilhan for Congress, sent $1,559.25 to the anti-Israel Palestine House of Freedom for "event tickets" in September. However, it is unclear which event the payments were for.</p><p>The Palestine House of Freedom made headlines earlier this year for hosting a fundraiser in June for the Palestinian Birzeit University, a school that has alleged terrorist ties and has seen its student council elections favor the pro-Hamas wing of student council members, according to The Washington Reporter.</p><p>The university’s student council has long been dominated by the Hamas-affiliated Al-Wafaa bloc and has been previously dubbed, "Terrorist University." Student campus parades have also reportedly included people marching with mock suicide bomb vests and rockets, as reported by Memri TV.</p><p>A Fox News Digital review found that the Hamas-affiliated Al-Wafaa bloc has won several student council elections at Birzeit dating back to the 1990's, including victories in 2022 and 2023. After the 2023 victory, a top Hamas operative reportedly told the Middle East Monitor the victory represents an "extension" of the movement.</p><p>"The second message is that the bloc has proven its ability to adapt to changes, overcome complexities, and fill the void created by arrests, martyrdom, or deportation," Ismail Haniyeh, who was head of Hamas’ Political Bureau until he was assassinated by Israel Defense Forces last year in Tehran, told the Middle East Monitor.</p><p>He added that Hamas is "unbreakable" in its homeland and that it will confront the "occupier, oppression and terrorism." This wasn't the first time a top Hamas operative praised the Al-Wafaa bloc's victory at Birzeit. In 2017, a top Hamas spokesperson reportedly congratulated the student body on the election results.</p><p>Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, R-Mich., sent a letter Sept. 29 to Harvard University, expressing concern about the university's failure to issue a public decision on its prior partnership with Birzeit. In the letter, the lawmakers called Birzeit "an institution whose student body overwhelmingly supports Hamas" and a school that "explicitly endorses a U.S. designated terrorist organization."</p><p>Harvard announced this spring it would not renew its cooperation agreement with Birzeit and would issue a permanent decision about the partnership after an internal review, according to The Harvard Crimson.</p><p>According to the June event’s flyer, all the proceeds from the Palestine House of Freedom fundraiser, "From Birzeit and Beyond: How academia shapes resistance and resilience," went to Birzeit.</p><p>Omar was one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress in 2018. She has taken heavy criticism for making anti-American and antisemitic comments over the years, including saying that "some people did something" in reference to the 9/11 attacks and saying that "Israel has hypnotized the world." She later apologized for the comment about Israel.</p><p>In September, a vote to censure Omar over comments she made about the assassination of Charlie Kirk narrowly failed to pass the House of Representatives.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Harvard, the Palestinian House of Freedom, Omar’s office and Ilhan for Congress for comment but did not receive a response by press time.</p></body></div></body></html>

Melissa was <span class="link">one of the strongest hurricanes</span> ever recorded in the Atlantic basin when it reached Jamaica on Tuesday afternoon as a Category 5 storm.</p><p>Its wind speeds slowed since its landfalls in Jamaica and Cuba to 100 mph early Thursday, making it a Category 2 hurricane, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.</p><p>Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major <span class="link">impacts on the mainland United States</span>.</p><h2>Melissa's forecast and path</h2><p>In its latest update early Thursday, the hurricane center said Melissa's core was about 145 miles northeast of the central Bahamas and some 755 miles southwest of Bermuda. </p><p>Melissa was hurrying north-northeast at 21 mph. Hurricane-force winds extended out up to 60 miles from Melissa's center and tropical storm-force winds extended out up to 185 miles, the NHC said. </p>
<p>On the forecast track, Melissa's center would "move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas this morning, then pass near or to the west of Bermuda later today and tonight," the hurricane center said, adding that "further strengthening is possible today before weakening likely begins on Friday."</p>
<p>The storm made landfall in Cuba early Wednesday as a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph. Before that, it slammed Jamaica's southwestern coast Tuesday afternoon, packing maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, the hurricane center said. Hurricanes reach Category 5 — the top of <span class="link">the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale</span> — when their winds hit 157 mph.</p>
<p>Melissa was moving extremely slowly over Jamaica, heightening the destruction it was causing. </p><p>The strongest previous hurricane to pound Jamaica was Gilbert in 1988, which killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.</p>
<p>The crew of a U.S. Air Force 403rd Wing "Hurricane Hunters" flight ran into severe turbulence as it approached Melissa's eyewall on Monday and had to return to their base in Florida, but they did capture stunning images of the center of the storm. Another flight on Tuesday to gather data on the hurricane also had to turn back after hitting strong turbulence.</p>
<h2>Hurricane advisories</h2><p>A hurricane warning was in effect early Thursday for the southeastern and central Bahamas and Bermuda, and a tropical storm warning wass posted for the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p><h2>Rainfall forecasts</h2><p>"Over the Southeastern Bahamas," according to the NHC, "storm total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected through this morning, which will result in areas of flash flooding. For the Turks and Caicos, rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches are expected."</p><h2>Climate change has been fueling the storm</h2><p>Above-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures, made worse by <span class="link">climate change</span>, helped Melissa rapidly intensify into a major hurricane, according to climate scientists.  </p><p>"That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now — around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal," Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading in the U.K., told The Associated Press. "And it's not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm."</p><p>Stronger winds, heavier rainfall and higher sea level rise will make storm surge more intense.</p><p>Preliminary data from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists monitoring the effects of climate change, suggests that climate change has increased Melissa's wind speed by 10 mph. </p>
<p>"Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification," Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, told the AP.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump slashes China tariffs after "amazing meeting" with Xi Jinping</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington </em>— President Trump said Thursday he will cut U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods after he sat down with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a high-stakes summit in South Korea in the midst of a months-long trade war between the world's two largest economies.</p><p>"On the scale from zero to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12," Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One while flying back to Washington from the South Korean city of Busan. He called his more than 90-minute session with Xi an "amazing meeting" and a "great success."</p><p>Mr. Trump told reporters "we have a deal" on trade, saying he expects to sign an agreement "pretty soon," though he's likely to renegotiate it in future years. "A lot of things we brought to finalization" during Thursday's discussions, the president added, calling Xi a "tremendous leader of a very powerful country."</p><p>Mr. Trump said he decided to lower his overall tariff rate on imports of Chinese goods from 57% to 47%, after promises by Xi to curtail shipments of fentanyl ingredients to the U.S. <span class="link">Levies of 47%</span> would still leave China with one of the highest tariff rates the U.S. imposes.</p><p>He also told reporters China will resume purchasing U.S. soybeans "immediately" after a boycott by China left Americans farmers reeling, and he said a conflict over Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports was "settled." Details on those agreements remain sparse.</p>
<p>He told reporters he would go to China in April for new talks, and Xi will "be coming here sometime after that, whether it's in Florida, Palm Beach or Washington, D.C."</p><p>The two leaders met on a South Korean military base at the tail end of an almost weeklong trip through Asia by Mr. Trump. </p><p>Prior to the meeting, Mr. Trump said he has a good relationship with Xi "but he's a very tough negotiator. That's not good." </p><p>Xi said trade negotiators from both sides have made progress in addressing "major concerns" and he believes the U.S. and China should be "partners and friends."</p>
<p>"Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye-to-eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then," Xi said through an interpreter, though he noted that relations have been "stable on the whole."</p>
<p>China is the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner, behind only Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. buying $438.9 billion in Chinese goods last year, while China bought $143.5 billion in goods from the U.S. But Mr. Trump has pushed for higher tariffs on Chinese imports, both due to fentanyl trafficking and alleged unfair trade practices, sparking a trade war.</p><p>The two sides briefly levied massive tit-for-tat tariffs on each other in April, before delaying those levies to buy time for negotiations. In August, Mr. Trump signed an executive action delaying the reinstatement of higher tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days, extending the pause until mid-November. </p><p>U.S. and Chinese officials have been holding trade talks for months leading up to Thursday's Trump-Xi meeting.  </p><p>Earlier this month, Mr. Trump threatened to <span class="link">impose an additional 100% tariff rate</span> on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 in retaliation for China's increased export controls on rare earth minerals and magnets, which would bring total tariffs on Chinese imports as high as 155%. China has the vast majority of the world's supply of those raw materials, critical for manufacturing in key technology areas like semiconductors and missiles. Those extra 100% tariffs are "effectively off the table" for now, <span class="link">Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday</span> on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan." </p><p>Bessent said he also expects Mr. Trump and Xi to <span class="link">sign a deal</span> Thursday placing TikTok under majority U.S. ownership, although Chinese-owned ByteDance could still have a minority ownership stake of under 20%.</p><p>Defense is another point of tension between China and the U.S.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump's first secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he should commit to Taiwan's independence. </p><p>"Xi Jinping is expected to press President Trump for clarity about America's stance toward Taiwan at their meeting this week," Pompeo wrote on social media. "America should oblige — and affirm our unequivocal commitment to Taiwan's sovereignty and independence from Beijing."</p><p>But on the trip home, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Xi didn't discuss Taiwan. </p><p>Separately, moments before the meeting with Xi began, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that he's directed the Pentagon to restart nuclear weapons testing. And the president <span class="link">said earlier Wednesday</span> that he will allow South Korea, a rival of China's, to develop a nuclear-powered submarine. </p><p>The last time Mr. Trump and Xi met in person was on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan in 2019, during Mr. Trump's first term in office, although the two leaders have spoken by phone. The last conversation the White House disclosed between the two men was on Sept. 19. </p><p>Busan, known as an educational and cultural center along Korea's southeastern coast, is the second most populous city in South Korea behind its capital, Seoul. The Xi meeting is the final agenda item on Mr. Trump's schedule for his five-day Asia tour, concluding a trip primarily intended to strengthen economic ties and cement trade deals in the South Pacific region. </p>

<section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington —</em> President Trump directed the Pentagon on Wednesday to resume testing of nuclear weapons "on an equal basis" with other countries' tests, possibly ending a decades-long U.S. pause that stretches back to the end of the Cold War.</p><p>The announcement came moments before Mr. Trump <span class="link">walked into a high-stakes meeting</span> with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.</p><p>"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis," the president wrote on Truth Social, using his administration's preferred term for the Defense Department. "That process will begin immediately."</p><p>It's not clear when or if the military will carry out a test, or what the president meant by restarting tests "on an equal basis."</p><p>The U.S. conducted its last nuclear weapons test in Nevada in 1992. President George H.W. Bush then imposed a moratorium on testing in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, according to the National Nuclear Security Administration.</p>
<p>China has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1996, and Russia — or the then-Soviet Union — hasn't carried out such a test since 1990, though Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday his country had tested a new nuclear-powered drone, which came shortly after a test of a new <span class="link">nuclear-capable and powered cruise missile</span>.</p><p>But China has rapidly expanded its nuclear arsenal in recent years, a trend that the Pentagon expects to continue for the rest of the decade.</p><p>Mr. Trump's meeting with Xi is expected to primarily focus on trade and tariffs, but security concerns still lurk in the U.S.-China relationship. </p><p>The U.S. military is discussing a missile launch this week in a "show of force" against recent Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, CBS News <span class="link">reported earlier Thursday</span>. And some Trump allies have encouraged the U.S. president to recognize Taiwanese independence, a move that Beijing has long viewed as unacceptable.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has used his dayslong Asia trip to boost relations with U.S. allies in the region like Japan and South Korea, two rivals of China. Earlier Wednesday, <span class="link">he said he will allow</span> South Korea to build a nuclear-powered submarine.</p>

<div class="article-title">Hurricane Melissa leaves trail of destruction, kills dozens in Caribbean</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Hurricane Melissa has left dozens dead and widespread destruction across Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba, as it continues to threaten the Bahamas and Bermuda.</p><p>The storm was bringing damaging winds, flooding rains and dangerous storm surge to the Bahamas on Wednesday night, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said, and residents should remain sheltered.  </p><p>Melissa made landfall over eastern Cuba early Wednesday, near the city of Chivirico, as an "extremely dangerous" Category 3 storm, the hurricane center said. On Tuesday, it <span class="link">pummeled Jamaica</span> as one of the <span class="link">strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record</span> with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph.</p><p>On Wednesday night, Melissa's core was about 105 miles east-northeast of the central Bahamas and about 800 miles southwest of Bermuda, according to the hurricane center. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, making it a Category 2 storm, and was moving northeast at about 21 mph.</p><p>It was expected to continue moving over the southeast or central Bahamas Wednesday night and pass near Bermuda late Thursday, the hurricane center said. </p>
<p>Officials across the parts of the Caribbean already hit by Melissa were assessing the storm's impacts. At least 23 people have died in Haiti and 13 are missing, the country's Civil Protection Agency said in a statement. At least four deaths were reported in Jamaica, and one in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<h2>Jamaica rushes to assess the damage</h2><p>In Jamaica, more than 25,000 people were packed into shelters Wednesday and more streamed in throughout the day after the storm ripped roofs off their homes and left them temporarily homeless. Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaica's education minister, said 77% of the island was without power.</p><p>Outages complicated assessing the damage because of "a total communication blackout" in areas, Richard Thompson, acting director-general of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, told the Nationwide News Network radio station.</p><p>Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a statement that teams are working to rescue people and bring relief where it's needed the most.</p>
<p>"Recovery will take time, but the government is fully mobilized," he said. "Relief supplies are being prepared, and we are doing everything possible to restore normalcy quickly."</p>
<p>Officials in Black River, Jamaica, a coastal town of approximately 5,000 people in the southwestern part of the island, pleaded for aid at a news conference Wednesday.</p><p>"Catastrophic is a mild term based on what we are observing," Mayor Richard Solomon said.</p><p>Solomon said the local rescue infrastructure had been demolished by the storm. The hospital, police units and emergency services were inundated by floods and unable to conduct emergency operations. The storm also destroyed the facility where relief supplies were being stored. </p><p>In southwest Jamaica, David Muschette, 84, sat among the rubble of his roofless house. He said he lost everything as he pointed to his wet clothes and furniture strewn across the grass while part of his roof partially blocked the road.</p><p>"I need help," he begged.</p>
<p>The government said it hopes to reopen Jamaica's airports as early as Thursday to ensure quick distribution of emergency relief supplies.</p>
<p>The United States is sending rescue and response teams to assist in recovery efforts in the Caribbean, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a social media post. He said government officials were coordinating with leadership in Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas.</p><p>"Our prayers are with the people of the Caribbean," he wrote.</p><p>St. Elizabeth Police Superintendent Coleridge Minto told Nationwide News Network on Wednesday that authorities have found at least four bodies in southwest Jamaica. One death was reported in the west when a tree fell on a baby, state minister Abka Fitz-Henley told Nationwide News Network.</p><p>Before landfall, Melissa had already been blamed for three deaths in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic.</p><h2>Cuba rides out the storm</h2><p>People in the eastern Cuban province of Santiago de Cuba began clearing debris around the collapsed walls of their homes on Wednesday after Melissa made landfall in the region hours earlier. </p><p>"Life is what matters," Alexis Ramos, a 54-year-old fisherman, said as he surveyed his destroyed home and shielded himself from the intermittent rain with a yellow raincoat. "Repairing this costs money, a lot of money."</p><p>Local media showed images of the Juan Bruno Zayas Clinical Hospital with severe damage: glass scattered across the floor, waiting rooms in ruins and masonry walls crumpled on the ground.</p>
<p>"It has been a very complex early morning," President Miguel Díaz-Canel wrote on X. "As soon as conditions allow, we will begin the recovery. We are ready."</p><p>The hurricane could worsen Cuba's severe economic crisis, which has already led to prolonged power blackouts along with fuel and food shortages.</p><p>Cuba's National Institute of Hydraulic Resources reported accumulated rainfall of 15 inches in Charco Redondo and 14 inches in Las Villas Reservoir.</p>
<h2>Moving toward the Bahamas</h2><p>Melissa began affecting the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday, Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, said. Authorities in the Bahamas were evacuating dozens of people from the archipelago's southeast corner ahead of Melissa's arrival.</p><p>"The storm is growing in size," Brennan said, noting that tropical storm-force winds now extend almost 200 miles from the center.</p><p>Melissa's center is forecast to move through the southeastern Bahamas later Wednesday, generating up to 7 feet of storm surge in the area. By late Thursday, Melissa is expected to pass just west of Bermuda. </p>

<div class="article-title">DOJ puts 2 prosecutors on leave after they described Jan. 6 "mob"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Justice Department placed two D.C.-based federal prosecutors on leave after they filed court papers calling the Jan. 6 Capitol siege a "riot" perpetrated by a "mob," three sources familiar with the matter told CBS News on Wednesday.</p><p>The papers were submitted Tuesday in the case of Taylor Taranto, who was pardoned by President Trump on Capitol riot charges earlier this year but was later convicted of livestreaming a bomb threat. He was arrested in 2023 while livestreaming himself driving around former President Barack Obama's D.C. neighborhood while armed, according to prosecutors. </p>
<p>The filing — which asked a judge to sentence Taranto to 27 months in prison at a hearing Thursday — mentioned Taranto's Jan. 6 charges and briefly described the events of that day, writing that "thousands of people comprising a mob of rioters attacked the U.S. Capitol." </p><p>That unsparing description of the Capitol riot was notable, as Mr. Trump <span class="link">has called Jan. 6</span> a "day of love" and <span class="link">referred to the rioters</span> as "hostages." </p><p>The filing also said Taranto drove to Obama's neighborhood shortly after Mr. Trump posted the former president's purported address on Truth Social and Taranto shared the post.</p>
<p>Hours after the sentencing memo was submitted, two prosecutors whose names appear on it were placed on leave, CBS News has confirmed. U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and staunch Trump backer, was also listed on the filing.</p><p>Then, later Wednesday, a new, shorter sentencing memo appeared in the federal court database with the references to the Jan. 6 riot and Mr. Trump's post about Obama now omitted. Two different federal prosecutors were listed at the bottom of the filing, along with Pirro.</p><p>Pirro said in a statement to CBS News: "While we don't comment on personnel decisions, we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously."</p><p>"We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target," she said.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump granted clemency to more than 1,500 accused and convicted Capitol rioters shortly after returning to the Oval Office earlier this year. The near-blanket pardons drew outrage from Democratic lawmakers and <span class="link">pushback from some federal judges</span> who accused the president of downplaying the event and perpetuating a "revisionist myth." </p><p>Taranto is one of several pardon recipients who have faced prosecution for non-Jan. 6 crimes. Earlier this month, a pardoned rioter was <span class="link">charged with allegedly threatening</span> House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Others have been accused of burglary and "raising a firearm at police." </p>

<html><body><div><article class="content content-article lazyload" data-index="0" data-path="/news/trump-administration-strikes-another-alleged-drug-boat-pacific-killing-4/" id="article-0">
<section class="content__body">
<p>The U.S. military carried out another strike on an alleged "narco-trafficking vessel" in the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday, killing four people, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said — marking at least the 15th boat to be hit in the Trump administration's two-month-long campaign of strikes that have killed more than 60 people.  </p><p>Hegseth posted a video of a boat strike on X. He said the strike was conducted in international waters, and alleged that the boat was operated by an unnamed designated terrorist organization. He said no U.S. forces were harmed.</p>
<p>The military began striking alleged drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean Sea early last month, and expanded the operations to the Eastern Pacific in recent weeks. In some, but not all, cases, the Trump administration <span class="link">has said</span> the boats were linked to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. </p><p>The administration has vowed to continue carrying out the strikes, <span class="link">arguing</span> the U.S. is in an "armed conflict" with drug cartels and gangs in Latin America, many of which the U.S. has designated as foreign terrorist organizations. </p><p>"The Western Hemisphere is no longer a safe haven for narco-terrorists bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans," Hegseth wrote Wednesday on X. "The Department of War will continue to hunt them down and eliminate them wherever they operate."</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has also floated the possibility of strikes on land-based targets, saying last week, "The land is going to be next."</p><p>The campaign has <span class="link">drawn pushback from some lawmakers</span> who want more evidence that the targets were actually smuggling drugs and warn that it could draw the U.S. into a conflict in the region. Congress has not authorized the strikes, though the Trump administration argues it doesn't need permission from the legislature. </p><p>Venezuela and Colombia have also expressed outrage over the strikes, which are part of a broader military buildup in the Caribbean, with several U.S. ships and thousands of troops <span class="link">deploying to the region</span>. </p><p>The administration has heaped pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, accusing him of partnering with drug traffickers — a charge he denies. A U.S. warship <span class="link">docked in nearby Trinidad and Tobago</span> over the weekend, which the Venezuelan government called a "hostile provocation."  </p>

<div class="article-title">Robocalls are the top U.S. consumer complaint. How California and tech companies are fighting back.</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>How many spam calls have you gotten so far today? Unwanted robocalls are Americans' number one consumer complaint, and that has CBS News California investigative correspondent Julie Watts asking: What's being done to stop them?</p><p>Whether they're pushing payday loans, sketchy charities or they're just a straight-up scam, robocalls aren't just annoying. If that automated voice is asking you for money, odds are that it's illegal.</p><p>Once a world traveler working on development projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, Julie Heifetz feels like her new full-time project is fielding spam calls.</p><p>"I get so many. I say, 'Damn it, it's another robocall!' " Heifetz said.</p><p>In 2010, we first asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) why putting your number on a do-not-call list didn't seem to work.</p>
<p>"If you didn't have a do-not-call list, it would be even worse," the FCC said then.</p><p>Well, today, it is worse. During the first nine months of 2025, there were 40.8 billion robocalls, according to data from YouMail, a visual voicemail and spam blocking service. That's up 5% from the same period last year.</p><p>Most violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which makes it illegal to make unsolicited automated or pre-recorded calls.</p><p>"It's still happening because it's really hard to track these people down," said Mike Mizenko with Nomorobo, one of a growing number of companies that deploy technology to help consumers block unwanted calls. "They're using all sorts of new technology all the time. They're very creative."</p>
<p>We first featured Nomorobo over a decade ago when they won the Federal Trade Commission's robocall blocking challenge. Their technology has come a long way, but so have the scammers.</p><p>So Nomorobo is taking a new approach, with Mizenko saying the company has "filed four lawsuits in a couple of different federal courts."</p><p>Nomorobo tracked and recorded thousands of robocalls using their own network of more than a quarter million unused phone lines, essentially a huge "honeypot" built to catch robocallers in real time.</p><p>"We have this data. We know it's real. We can prove everything we allege," Mizenko said.</p><p>The company sued some of the bad actors, who so far have mostly been debt collectors.</p><p>"We can kind of make a statement and say, 'Hey. We're watching. We know what you're doing. We can prove what you are doing. You need to clean up your practices,' " Mizenko said.</p><p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta has taken legal action, too, joining a multi-state lawsuit against Avid Telecom for making billions of illegal robocalls.</p>
<p>Recently, Bonta joined other attorneys general in sending warning letters to companies suspected of generating major robocall traffic. We caught up with Bonta in San Francisco to ask him about how effective these letters can be.</p><p>"It's remarkably impactful, especially when it's multiple attorneys general," he said. "We'll monitor their response, and if they don't comply, a lawsuit will be the next step."</p><p>A recent analysis of FCC data finds that more than 50% of U.S. phone companies are not complying with the federal robocall law, which requires them to install mandated software and adopt anti-robocall policies.</p><p>"I think [the FCC] can do more and I think attorneys general can do more, and I'll say that because we have many Americans still suffering from robocalls," Bonta said. "Not pointing the blame but just trying to share the responsibility."</p><p>We emailed the FCC for comment and received an auto-reply saying that press inquiries won't be responded to due to the government shutdown.</p><p>"Unless they're stopped, it's just going to grow and grow because if they can get away with it, why not?" Heifetz said.</p><p>Avid Telecom asked a court to dismiss the multi-state lawsuit filed against it and was denied. We tried to contact the company for comment, but the website was down and the phone number was disconnected.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump gives approval for South Korea to build nuclear-powered submarine</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump said Wednesday that South Korea can build a nuclear-powered submarine. </p><p>"Our Military Alliance is stronger than ever before and, based on that, I have given them approval to build a Nuclear Powered Submarine, rather than the old fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel powered Submarines that they have now," the president wrote on Truth Social during a multiday visit to South Korea.</p><p>Mr. Trump added that the submarine will be built in Philadelphia, as the president and lawmakers seek foreign investments as a way to boost the American shipbuilding industry. A South Korean company bought the Philly Shipyard last year.</p><p>During a meeting with Mr. Trump earlier Wednesday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said he's looking for U.S. support in getting nuclear fuel for submarines. He argued that shifting away from diesel-electric submarines — which typically have more limited ranges — would allow South Korea to help the U.S. Navy patrol the region.</p><p>"We're not aiming for nuclear-armed submarines, but rather, conventionally armed submarines powered by nuclear energy," Lee said through a translator, saying his country's existing fleet has "limited capabilities" and "cannot really effectively monitor and counter any undersea activities from other countries."</p>
<p>Nuclear-powered submarines are a key part of the U.S.'s naval fleet, and the advanced technology necessary to build them is closely guarded by U.S. officials. The Biden administration <span class="link">inked a deal</span> with Australia to help the country build the submarines. </p><p>The move could pose concerns for the U.S. and South Korea's two mutual rivals in the region, North Korea and China. The Chinese navy has nuclear-powered submarines, and North Korea said earlier this year it had developed one. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday local time, for talks that are expected to focus on trade.</p><p>Mr. Trump announced the submarine deal as part of a broader trade agreement with South Korea, the United States' sixth-largest trading partner and a key military ally in the region. </p><p>He said the country has agreed to "pay the USA" $350 billion, invest in U.S. industry, and buy American oil and gas in exchange for lower U.S. tariffs on South Korean imports. Mr. Trump <span class="link">outlined a similar deal</span> over the summer, which called for 15% tariffs on South Korean goods.</p>

<p>"The site is under construction" is a sign that could greet visitors peering through the fence at the southeast corner of the White House, trying to catch a glimpse of where the <span class="link">East Wing</span> once stood. </p><p>Instead, those are the words greeting visitors to the websites of several companies working on building the White House ballroom.</p>
<p>Some of these firms appear to be trying to lower their profiles (in some cases, literally, on social media) amid the sometimes vitriolic online reaction to the East Wing demolition and construction of the 90,000-square-foot, <span class="link">privately financed ballroom</span>. None of the firms have been accused of any legal wrongdoing. </p><p>EAI Rolloff, a Maryland-based hauling company, has advised visitors to its homepage that the site is "Undergoing Routine Maintenance." There are no links or contact information listed.</p>
<p>It's not clear when the site was taken offline or why, but an archived version from earlier this year gives customers options to learn about the company's services, contact the firm or read about its history. </p>
<p>"We are honest, ethical, responsive, professional and diligent," the company's archived "core values" page said. </p><p>Late last week, a red and charcoal gray truck bearing the EAI logo and phone number <span class="link">delivered</span> discarded rebar from the White House to a scrap yard just outside Washington. The company did not respond to emails and a phone call seeking comment. </p><p>Photographers last week captured heavy equipment leveling the East Wing and corridor connecting it to the White House residence. Emblazoned in black, white and red on an excavator arm was ACECO, a Maryland-based demolition company. </p><p>ACECO's website is also unavailable. "This Site Is Under Construction," it says in bold block lettering. As recently as August, according to the Internet Archive, ACECO's site showed off the firm's work at the University of Maryland and heralded its clients, which included Clark Construction, the construction contractor hired to build the White House ballroom.</p>
<p>Social media profiles for the company and its leadership are no longer active. WTOP reported that ratings website Yelp "temporarily disabled the posting of content to the page for ACECO" because of hostility directed at the company. </p><p>One Yelp poster wrote, "How do you sleep at night when all of America hates you?"</p><p>Representatives for ACECO — perhaps unsurprisingly — did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>When President Trump announced the project this summer, he named McCrery Architects as the lead design firm. As recently as April, McCrery's site was robust, displaying the firm's prior design projects, its approach to architecture and staff biographies, according to an archived version of the page maintained by the Internet Archive. </p>
<p>Now, McCrery's website is limited to a single page with a rotating photo, generic email address and phone number. Renderings of the White House ballroom are included in the photo carousel.</p>
<p>When CBS News called the number listed on the firm's website, the phone rang several times before a recorded message said the voicemail was full. A McCrery spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. </p><p>Not all companies have shunned attention brought on by their association with the ballroom. </p>
<p>Websites for Clark Construction and AECOM, the lead engineering firm, appear to be intact. Both are large companies — Clark has a national footprint and AECOM is a multinational company valued at $17 billion and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>The smaller businesses that have pulled down their websites are headquartered in the Washington, D.C., area.</p><p>Carrier, another multibillion-dollar, publicly traded company, was not shy about its involvement in the ballroom. A company spokesperson proclaimed that Carrier was "honored to provide the new iconic ballroom at the White House with a world-class, energy-efficient HVAC system."</p>

<div class="article-title">Red Cross responds to video of Hamas allegedly moving Israeli hostage remains</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Red Cross told CBS News on Wednesday that its staff in Gaza "were not able to intervene directly on-site" as alleged Hamas members were seen burying and then uncovering the remains of a deceased hostage in the Palestinian territory earlier this week. </p><p>The Israel Defense Forces released a video on Tuesday that it said showed the incident. </p><p>The Red Cross said it was "raising its concerns directly with parties."</p><p>The video, which appears to have been filmed by an IDF drone, shows masked men, some in military fatigues and others in civilian clothing, removing a shrouded body from a building near Gaza City's Shejaiya neighborhood and carrying it into a large adjacent pit, before burying it under rocks and dirt by hand.</p><p>A bulldozer is then shown lifting the body and a quantity of dirt and moving it to the front of the building, where it stayed as three people wearing red ICRC vests arrived.</p>
<p>The three people wearing ICRC vests remained at the site as the men moved the body from the bulldozer, placed it onto a large mound of dirt and buried it a second time.</p><p>Several minutes later, the video, which had been edited, shows a man with a shovel partially uncovering the body again while three people wearing red ICRC vests look on.</p><p>A man identified by the IDF as a photographer appears to film the second unearthing of the body, while the three apparent ICRC representatives stand near a road a short distance away from the site. </p>
<p>CBS News has verified the video's location in Gaza City, but was unable to independently verify the date or time the video was filmed or the identities of the masked men in the video. The video released by the IDF also includes several edits, where video clips were joined together.</p>
<p>The IDF accused Hamas of "attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies, while in fact holding deceased hostages whose remains it refuses to release as required by the agreement."</p><p>The remains were later identified as belonging to Ofir Tzarfati by his family. Israeli officials had said his body was previously recovered from Gaza during a military operation shortly after the start of the war, before these additional remains were handed over.</p><p>In a statement shared by a group representing Israeli hostage families on Tuesday, the Tzarfati family said Hamas had inflicted a deception "upon our family as we try to heal."</p><p>"This morning we were shown video footage of our beloved son's remains being removed, buried, and handed over to the Red Cross — an abhorrent manipulation designed to sabotage the deal and abandon the effort to bring all the hostages home," the family was quoted as saying.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin <span class="link">Netanyahu's office criticized Hamas</span> for handing over Tzarfati's remains, rather than one of the 13 deceased hostages still missing <span class="link">in Gaza</span>, calling it "a clear violation of the agreement" brokered by President Trump to halt the two-year war.</p><p>The IDF said it had recorded Hamas operatives on Monday "removing body remains from a structure that had been prepared in advance and burying them nearby," and then staging "a false display of discovering a deceased hostage's body."</p><p>"ICRC staff were not aware the human remains shown in the video in the mouth of an excavator had been previously staged," the global charity told CBS News in a statement on Wednesday, stressing that the recovery of human remains "is the responsibility of parties under international humanitarian law, and ICRC staff are not involved in retrieval."</p>
<p>The charity, which has helped to facilitate the transfer of Israeli hostages' remains from Gaza back to Israel, said in a statement shared with CBS News earlier Wednesday that members of its team who appear in the IDF video "were not aware that a deceased person had been placed there prior to their arrival, as seen in the footage. In general, our role as neutral intermediary does not include the unearthing of the bodies of the deceased."</p><p>Israel's foreign ministry said on social media that it "appreciat(ed) the Red Cross condemnation of Hamas' staged 'burials' &amp; 'discoveries' of hostage bodies (which they previously extracted from Hamas holding sites)," but it added: "There seems to be a gap between what the Red Cross office knows &amp; reality, given footage of Red Cross staff at the deception. We trust @ICRC will take action regarding lies their staff apparently report upwards."</p>

<section class="content__body">
<p>In widely expected job cuts after completing its <span class="link">$8 billion merger with Skydance</span>, Paramount has begun layoffs set to impact about 2,000 employees.</p><p>Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs companywide on Wednesday (Paramount Skydance owns CBS News.) The rest of the cuts are expected to be made at a later date. In all, 2,000 job reductions amount to about 10% of Paramount's total workforce.</p><p>"These decisions are never made lightly, especially given their effect on our colleagues who have made meaningful contributions to the company," CEO David Ellison wrote Wednesday in a memo to employees.</p><p>The prospect of job cuts has hovered over Paramount employees for some time. Ellison on Wednesday reiterated that the company has been working to restructure since the completion of its merger in August, and noted that workforce cuts are "part of that process."</p><p>It's not uncommon for businesses to initiate layoffs following a merger. When Skydance completed its purchase of Paramount, the combined company said it would look for "opportunities to streamline its business." Paramount is also rumored to have interest in buying Warner Bros. Discovery, the home of HBO, CNN and DC Studios, among other brands. </p>
<p>Neither Paramount nor Warner has publicly confirmed talks. But Warner earlier this month signaled that it may be open to <span class="link">selling all or parts of its business</span> in light of "unsolicited interest" it said it had received from multiple parties. The company has reportedly been resistant to Paramount's initial approach. According to CNBC, which cited anonymous sources, Warner had rejected three offers from Paramount as of last week.</p>

<div class="article-title">Why the "no hire, no fire" job market may no longer be a thing</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>For most of 2025, the job market was described by economists as "no hire, no fire" — a stretch of time when job seekers faced slim prospects, but workers could count on job security. But that fragile balance may now be shifting, labor experts warn, as mass layoffs at companies like Amazon and UPS signal a possible turning point for the labor market.</p><p>Amazon on Tuesday <span class="link">announced</span> 14,000 job cuts, citing a shift toward artificial intelligence, while UPS on the same day said it has reduced its workforce by 48,000 from a year earlier. Paramount Skydance, the owner of CBS News, on Wednesday also announced it is shedding jobs, part of an ongoing effort to cut costs at the entertainment and media company. </p><p>Target on Tuesday also notified a state employment agency in Minnesota, where the retailer is based, that it plans to lay off more than 800 workers in January as part of a broader corporate restructuring, <span class="link">CBS News Minnesota reported</span>. The retailer announced last week that it would cut 1,800 corporate positions as the chain trims its global workforce by about 8%.</p><p>The mass layoffs come as the Federal Reserve scrutinizes the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing <span class="link">concerns about slower hiring</span> in announcing the central bank's first interest-rate cut of 2025. The announcements from Amazon and UPS could signal that the Fed has good reason to be worried, experts said. </p><p>"No question that this is a shift, and it does seem to me it signals that 'no hire, no fire' is a thing of the past," John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, told CBS News. </p>
<p>"These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy," he added.</p><h2>Layoffs picking up</h2><p>Even before Tuesday's job cuts, layoffs <span class="link">had been trending higher</span>, according to data from Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. Employers across the U.S. cut nearly 950,000 jobs this year through September, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, its most recent data shows.</p><p>Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the <span class="link">government shutdown</span>, which means the Fed will make its <span class="link">next interest rate decision</span> tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September. </p><p>But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August — down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows. </p>
<p>On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers <span class="link">declined by 32,000 jobs</span> in September.</p><p>At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note.</p><p>To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say.</p><p>"When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-à-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up," said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation. </p><p>But, he added, "These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings."</p><p>That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of <span class="link">long-term unemployed people</span>, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022.</p><h2>What's impacting the labor market?</h2><p>Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to <span class="link">trim its human workforce</span> as the business becomes more efficient.</p>
<p>"Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology — and being on the cutting edge of that technology — for shifting jobs," Challenger said. </p><p>About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed.</p><p>Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as <span class="link">shipping declines from Amazon</span>, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS.</p><p>On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government. </p><p>The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside. </p><p>In the meantime, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the job market, according to recent <span class="link">CBS News polling</span>. About 52% of Americans describe the labor market as "bad," up seven percentage points from April, the poll found.</p><p>"We are moving more into a time where job security might be more precarious," Challenger said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Toronto Blue Jays take a 3-2 lead over Los Angeles Dodgers in World Series</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>LOS ANGELES — Trey Yesavage set a World Series rookie record with 12 strikeouts, and the Toronto Blue Jays opened Game 5 with back-to-back homers in a 6-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Wednesday that moved them within one win of their first championship since 1993.</p> <p>Davis Schneider and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. connected on Blake Snell's first and third pitches, the first consecutive home runs to start a Series game.</p> <p>Yesavage, a precocious 22-year-old right-hander who began his season last April pitching before 327 fans in Class A, took over from there.</p> <p>With a sinking splitter, spinning slider and overpowering fastball that quieted LA bats and a crowd of 52,175, he broke the prior Series rookie record of 11 strikeouts set by Don Newcombe for the Dodgers in a 1-0 loss to the New York Yankees in the 1949 opener. Getting six Ks each with his splitter and slider, Yesavage became the first World Series pitcher with 12 strikeouts and no walks.</p>
<p>"I'm kind of blown away by what he did," Toronto manager John Schneider said.</p> <p>After losing a Game 3 heartbreaker in 18 innings Monday night, the resilient Blue Jays bounced right back with two comfortable wins.</p> <p>Toronto leads 3-2 in the best-of-seven matchup and can dethrone the defending champions back home when the Series resumes Friday night at Rogers Centre. No team has won consecutive titles since the Yankees took three in a row from 1998-2000.</p> <p>"We've got to kind of wipe the slate clean and find a way to win Game 6 and pick up the pieces and see where we're at," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.</p>
<p>Yesavage allowed three hits over seven innings and his only run when Kiké Hernández homered on a high fastball to trim the Dodgers' deficit to 2-1 in the third.</p> <p>Seranthony Domínguez and Jeff Hoffman finished a four-hitter.</p> <p>"When three of my pitches are in the strike zone, or even two, like part of tonight, I mean, I'm in control," Yesavage said. "Just stay in the strike zone and get ahead."</p> <p>Yesavage debuted with the Blue Jays on Sept. 15, his fifth level of baseball this year. He went 1-0 in three regular-season starts and is 3-1 in five postseason outings.</p>
<p>Yesavage induced 23 swings and misses — most in a Series game since pitch tracking started in 2008, one more than San Francisco's Tim Lincecum in 2010 Game 5.</p> <p>"Obviously the stuff is incredible, but the maturity to go and handle these moments is unbelievable. It was a special thing to watch today," teammate Bo Bichette said. "I think he's ultra confident, but you never hear it in the clubhouse, which I think says something about him. He comes here to work and try to help us win. I can't say enough good things about his performance."</p> <p>Snell, a two-time Cy Young Award winner, dropped to 0-2 in the Series, allowing five runs, six hits and four walks over 6 2/3 innings.</p> <p>Roberts shook up his slumping batting order, dropping Mookie Betts as low as third for the first time since 2021 and benching outfielder Andy Pages in favor of Alex Call. It didn't spark an offense that is hitting .202 in the Series and has solo shots on seven of its eight home runs. Los Angeles has scored just four runs in its last 29 innings.</p> <p>The Dodgers also threw four wild pitches in a span of two innings.</p> <p>"We've got to make some adjustments," Roberts said. "We've been in elimination games, a core group of these guys, and we've got to find a way to win a game. That's it."</p>
<p>Davis Schneider, batting first only because regular leadoff hitter George Springer got hurt in Game 3, sent Snell's first pitch into the left-field bleachers. Guerrero hit the third into the Dodgers' bullpen for his eighth home run of the postseason.</p> <p>Davis Schneider mimics different stances during the year, including Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Bobby Witt Jr. and even the Dodgers' Will Smith during the World Series. The part-time outfielder and second baseman was in an old stance of his from the minor leagues against Snell.</p>
<p>Snell started with three fastballs, then avoided another one for 22 consecutive pitches before striking out Andres Giménez with a heater to end the second.</p> <p>Ernie Clement added a fourth-inning sacrifice fly for a 3-1 lead after right fielder Teoscar Hernández came up short on a sliding catch attempt as Daulton Varsho's drive bounced into the right-field corner for a leadoff triple.</p> <p>Another run scored on a wild pitch in the seventh by Edgardo Henriquez, who then allowed Bichette's RBI single. Isiah Kiner-Falefa added a run-scoring single in the eighth off Anthony Banda.</p> <p>"I think we just want to be the toughest outs we can possibly be," Bichette said. "We're a team, man, and we'll do anything we can to win."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Up next</h3> <p>Dodgers RHP Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Toronto RHP Kevin Gausman start Game 6 in a rematch of Game 2, which Los Angeles won 5-1. Yamamoto pitched a four-hitter for the first World Series complete game since 2015 and has pitched the first consecutive postseason complete games since Curt Schilling had three in a row in 2001. Gausman allowed three runs in 6 2/3 innings.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Nobel Prize-winning author Wole Soyinka said on Tuesday that his non-resident visa to enter the United States had been rejected, adding that he believes it may be because he recently criticized President Donald Trump.</p> <p>The Nigerian author, 91, won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986, becoming the first African to do so.</p> <p>Speaking to the press on Tuesday, Soyinka said he believed it had little to do with him and was instead a product of the United States' immigration policies. He said he was told to reapply if he wished to enter again.</p> <p>"It's not about me, I'm not really interested in going back to the United States," he said. "But a principle is involved. Human beings deserve to be treated decently wherever they are."</p>
<p>Soyinka, who has taught in the U.S. and previously held a green card, joked on Tuesday that his green card "had an accident" eight years ago and "fell between a pair of scissors." In 2017, he destroyed his green card in protest over Trump's first inauguration.</p> <p>The letter he received informing him of his visa revocation cites "additional information became available after the visa was issued," as the reason for its revocation, but does not describe what that information was.</p> <p>Soyinka believes it may be because he recently referred to Trump as a "white version of Idi Amin," a reference to the dictator who ruled Uganda from 1971 until 1979.</p> <p>He jokingly referred to his rejection as a "love letter" and said that while he did not blame the officials, he would not be applying for another visa.</p> <p>"I have no visa. I am banned, obviously, from the United States, and if you want to see me, you know where to find me."</p> <p>The U.S. Consulate in Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, directed all questions to the State Department in Washington, D.C. Through a spokesperson, it said that because under US law visa records are generally confidential, they would not discuss the specifics of this case while stressing that "visas are a privilege, not a right" and that "visas may be revoked at any time, at the discretion of the U.S. government, whenever circumstances warrant."</p>

<div class="article-title">The East Wing gave women space to thrive in the White House — here's why</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>When workers tore down the East Wing to make room for President Trump's new ballroom earlier this month, several longtime White House staples were also lost: the public entrance to the presidential grounds, the first lady's office, the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden and a movie theater. First Ladies and their staff worked there for decades.</p> <p>"It has long been a space of female power and a female niche in the White House," said Elizabeth Rees, a historian and research fellow at the University of Virginia's Miller Center. "With the West Wing being a traditionally male-dominated space, the East Wing was a unique physical space for women to work…and provided them with their own environment in which to flourish."</p>
<p>The East Wing traces its beginnings to 1902, when President Theodore Roosevelt built a terrace for guests to enter the presidential complex during social events. In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt expanded the site to cover up an underground bunker he had built for protection. Office space was also added. </p>
<p>During the Kennedy administration in the 1960s, the first lady's staff expanded rapidly.</p>
<p>"As mass media is on the rise and there's enormous press interest in this young, glamorous first lady and her small children, that interest necessitates that there is a press arm for the first lady to cover her activities and to spread all this information to the press," said Rees.</p> <p>Jacqueline Kennedy's flagship project as first lady was restoring the White House. That move inspired a trend for first ladies to foster at least one key project. First ladies thus needed bigger staff, but they lacked sufficient office space. </p> <p>"Betty Ford and earlier First Ladies were pretty much working out of their bedrooms, literally," said MaryAnne Borrelli, author of The Politics of the President's Wife and professor of government at Connecticut College.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>When the</strong> <strong>first lady moved to the East Wing</strong></h3> <p>Plans to move the first lady's office to the East Wing started under the Ford presidency (1974-1977), Borelli said. Rosalynn Carter was the first to have office space for herself and her staff in the East Wing.</p>
<p>"To have a dedicated office space was a key part of the professionalization of the role," said Rees. "[It] meant these women had their own environment to develop policy or projects."</p>
<p>In 1978, a law gave more funding for the first lady and her staff to carry out their duties. Under first lady Carter, Rees said, the staff became formally known as the Office of the First Lady, a professional unit within the Executive Office of the President. </p> <p>From there, Carter focused on mental health initiatives. Among her successors, Laura Bush launched a literacy campaign, Michelle Obama promoted Let's Move – targeting childhood obesity – and Melania Trump backed Be Best, which advocates for children's wellbeing. </p> <p>Even though women in the White House made big strides in the East Wing, some had reservations.</p> <p>"The West Wing is the seat of power in the White House. And it's all about proximity, right?" said Kate Andersen Brower, author of <em>First Women: The Grace &amp; Power of America's Modern First Ladies</em>. "There's a built-in, Siberia nature to the East Wing," added Brower, who covered the Obama administration for Bloomberg News.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton was the first to have an office in the West Wing, steps from the president's Oval Office.</p> <p>"She saw the West Wing as the policymaking locus, and the East Wing as more ceremonial and symbolic. And I think over time, she became aware of the power that comes through ceremony and symbolism," said Borrelli.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>What's next?</strong></h3>
<p>The White House has not yet confirmed whether the newly built wing of the White House will include permanent offices for the first lady. Melania Trump's skeleton staff is currently working out of various offices at the White House.</p> <p>The East Wing getting torn down "definitely diminishes the role of the first lady… and the fact that we haven't heard from Melania Trump kind of says it all," said Andersen. "I think Donald Trump doesn't really care about the symbolism of the East Wing."</p> <p>Berelli said Trump is trying to leave his mark on the White House, just like his predecessors – as illustrated by the Truman Balcony and the Rose Garden.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of office space that's now gone. Where are you going to accommodate those people? Are you going to change the West Wing and make space in the West Wing?" Borrelli asked. A ballroom could be converted later on into office space, she added, and it is yet to be seen how long the new structure will last.</p> <p><em>This story was edited by Olivia Hampton</em>.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>President Trump says he has given South Korea permission to build a nuclear-powered submarine following trade negotiations in the country, saying  in a post on Truth Social that "Our Military Alliance is stronger than ever before."</p> <p>Trump followed up in a separate post to say that the submarine would be built in Philadelphia. "Shipbuilding in our Country will soon be making a BIG COMEBACK," he wrote. </p> <p>It's unclear what the timeline for such a project would be.</p> <p>The news followed earlier announcements about trade and investment plans between the two countries. The U.S. and South Korea affirmed that Seoul is investing $350 billion into the U.S. following months of trade talks, including how that money would be distributed.</p>
<p>All the details of the agreement are yet to be released, but the Korean government said $150 billion of the investment will go toward revitalizing U.S. shipbuilding. Tariffs on South Korean goods will also be lowered from 25% to 15%.</p> <p>Trump met South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung in Gyeongju during the APEC summit. Korea is the last stop on a three-nation tour in Asia for Trump. His final meeting is with Chinese President Xi Jinping, also on the sidelines of the summit in South Korea.  </p>

<div class="article-title">What Wikipedia and Grokipedia are saying about each other</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Elon Musk's Grokipedia encyclopedia is now online, challenging volunteer-edited Wikipedia with a new tool that incorporates Grok, the large language model chatbot developed by Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI.</p>
<p>Musk is positioning Grokipedia as an alternative to Wikipedia, which he called "Wokepedia" in an X post last December. Musk has lofty ambitions for the new encyclopedia: His stated goal is to create "an open source, comprehensive collection of all knowledge."</p> <p>Critics and pundits are busy comparing the two sites and how they present a range of controversial topics. But we can also learn about some of their differences by asking a simple question: What do Wikipedia and Grokipedia say about each other?</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Searching for each other</h3> <p>A search for "Wikipedia" on Grokipedia yielded 6,047 results early Wednesday, a number that reflects both the work that's gone into Grokipedia and the challenge of competing with an encyclopedia that's been growing for nearly 25 years.</p> <p>On Wikipedia, a search for "Grokipedia" returned 13 results.</p> <p>Meanwhile, two days after its Monday launch, a search for "Grokipedia" on Grokipedia did not return a dedicated entry. Instead, the eight search results ranged from a general entry about online encyclopedias to seven entries primarily about Wikipedia.</p> <p>Typing "grokipedia" into Grokipedia's URL to see if the new encyclopedia might have an entry that's not yet searchable returns a message: "This page doesn't exist ... yet."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Bias and imitation</h3> <p>On its page about Wikipedia, Grokipedia says the site is renowned for its "unprecedented scale, accessibility, and role in democratizing information." But Grokipedia also says Wikipedia is the subject of "persistent criticisms regarding factual reliability, susceptibility to vandalism and hoaxes, and systemic ideological biases — particularly a left-leaning slant in coverage of political figures and topics."</p>
<p>The lengthy article uses forms of the word "bias" dozens of times. It alleges that Wikipedia suffers from "ideological skew" to the left, and states that the site's preference for a neutral point of view drawn from reliable sources can instead reinforce narratives that "align with institutional biases in academia and media."</p> <p>On its page about Grokipedia, Wikipedia says that Musk "positioned Grokipedia as an alternative to Wikipedia that would 'purge out the propaganda.'" It also notes that Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger, who has become a critic of the long-running encyclopedia, welcomed Grokipedia's arrival.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia article about Grokipedia highlights criticisms of the new site, such as media reports that Grokipedia's article about Elon Musk omits mention of the controversy over a gesture he made earlier this year "which many viewed as resembling a Nazi salute." It also says critics allege Grokipedia promotes right-leaning views and relies too much on AI tools.</p>
<p>Wikipedia also notes that Grokipedia seems to have pulled text from Wikipedia, stating, "Some articles are nearly identical to their Wikipedia entries."</p> <p>In some cases, Grokipedia duplicates Wikipedia content, as noted by media outlets and Wikipedia users. Grokipedia's page on "buttocks," for instance, is virtually a copy of the Wikipedia page (albeit without images).</p> <p>In that and similar cases, the articles acknowledge that their "content was adapted from Wikipedia."</p> <p>Musk said at the <em>All-In Podcast</em> conference in September that Grok was working to evaluate information from sources such as Wikipedia pages and then "rewrite the page to … remove the falsehoods, correct the half-truths and add the missing context."</p> <p>Like Wikipedia, Grokipedia users can see an article's edit history. But while Wikipedia users can directly edit a story, Grokipedia offers tools to ask questions and submit a correction.</p>
<p>"Wikipedia's knowledge is — and always will be — human," the Wikimedia Foundation said in a statement to NPR. Noting the site's ethos of open collaboration and consensus, it added, "This human-created knowledge is what AI companies rely on to generate content; even Grokipedia needs Wikipedia to exist."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Nuts and bolts</h3> <p>Numbers rule the internet, and these two sites are fairly accurate about their rival's size, with some caveats.</p> <p>Wikipedia, for instance, says that Grokipedia had "about 900,000 AI-generated articles" as of Oct. 28. That same day, Grokipedia's site said it had 885,279 articles available -- a figure published on its landing page. The Wikipedia entry for Grokipedia didn't reference that precise number, and it cited an article from the Indian financial news site Moneycontrol instead of Grokipedia's data -- perhaps to capture a historical record of a figure that will be updated. An editor later updated the citation to point to an Axios article.</p>
<p>Grokipedia accurately states that as of October 2025, Wikipedia had more than 7 million articles in English, in the main entry about its older rival. But further down that page, the entry muddies the water a bit by stating that Wikipedia had "over 6.8 million articles in English alone by October 2025."</p> <p>According to Wikipedia's running count on the Size of Wikipedia page, the English site had more than 6.9 million articles as of January 2025.</p> <p><strong><em>Disclosure:</em></strong><em> NPR CEO Katherine Maher is the former CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">'The helpers need help'. Food banks brace for impact as SNAP cliff looms.</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Chris Jones and Mary Ann Edwards have been volunteering at the Llano Food Pantry in central Texas for several years. It's a tight-knit group, where food recipients gather early to chat outside, and community members contribute their own produce.</p> <p>"The ladies all come in and go, 'guess what I did with those plums I got last time?' We share recipes, we talk and it's like a big family," Edwards said.</p> <p>Four years ago, the pantry was receiving 15-20 people each week. Now, they say, the number is about a hundred clients every week.</p> <p>"Right now — and we've been doing this for a while — we limit canned goods," said Jones. "We didn't have to do that in the beginning because we didn't have that many people coming through."</p>
<p>They said the past year has been tough for families, with rising food costs.</p> <p>"I think the telltale is that every time we're opening, we are getting new clients — maybe one, maybe two, maybe three," said Edwards. "Just a steady increase. They come in, they're embarrassed — 'I never thought I would be in this position.' You know, a lot of people are in the same position you're in, and that's why we're here."</p> <p>Their clientele is mainly young families, people with disabilities and the elderly. They said they don't see a lot of people who also receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.</p>
<p>"That's not saying that when that goes away, we're not going to get a bunch of new people coming in," mused Edwards.</p> <p>SNAP is a mandatory entitlement program that provides food aid to about 1 in 8 U.S. residents. It is the country's largest nutrition assistance program. Congressionally-approved appropriations provide the roughly $8 billion a month needed to fund the program. With the U.S. Senate repeatedly failing to get enough votes to fund the government and end the shutdown, nearly 42 million people are in danger of losing those benefits come Nov. 1.</p> <p>Jones said they'll have to take it one week at a time.</p>
<p>"If we need to, we'll do a fundraiser," she said.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">'Catastrophic need for food'</h3> <p>The Llano pantry is part of the Central Texas Food Bank, which has been ramping up distributions in the midst of the government shutdown, including for active duty military personnel and civilian federal employees like TSA agents.</p> <p>"We've been saying that although the government has shut down, the Central Texas Food Bank is open and that means we will do everything we can to step up and meet the demand for increased need of our services," said CEO Sari Vatske.</p> <p>But Vatske cautioned that food banks alone cannot make up for what would be lost for residents if SNAP were to disappear.</p> <p>"The average household that we see receives about $350 per month, which roughly translates to about $44 million worth of SNAP benefits that will be gone from families," she told NPR. "There is no way that we alone can make up for a $44 million food budget shortfall."</p> <p>She said shutdowns aren't like other food crises.</p> <p>"When you see natural disasters, they tend to be isolated, whether it's an ice storm or a flood. But the thing with the government shutdown is that it's manmade and we are all experiencing it," Vatske said. "So in a situation during a natural disaster where we could rely on our sister food banks for support, with this government shutdown, we are all experiencing the same need. So we implore the government to reopen and we are asking the community to step up now more than ever."</p> <p>Vatske said seeing the increasing demand and knowing benefits might be taken away adds to the toll food bank volunteers and staffers face.</p> <p>"The thing that motivates food bankers is knowing that we are a beacon of light in an otherwise dark place," she said. "We're really at a point that the helpers need help."</p>
<p>Jason Riggs, the director of advocacy and public policy at Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico, began working at the food bank during the Great Recession.</p> <p>"The absolute worst part of working at a food bank is when you gotta tell people, 'that's all we got today. We're out.' And you know you can't send them anywhere because they're going to be out, too," he said. "Now, don't get me wrong, it's far worse for the people waiting in that line. But, I worry about my co-workers."</p> <p>If SNAP benefits are gone for November, Riggs said it will be a "public health crisis." He compared it to the recession 17 years ago and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> <p>"This is a huge increase in need, but that's where comparisons end," he told NPR. "Those two previous national crises, when that happened, there was a robust SNAP program, with all its flaws, doing what it is designed to do. And that's the difference with what's happening right now — there will not be SNAP. There will just be the same kind of catastrophic need for food."</p> <p>New Mexico has about 21 percent of its population participate in SNAP, the highest rate in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's statistics from earlier this year.</p> <p>"It's very difficult. It's not like we were holding back before," Riggs said. "Then this crisis comes in and it's very daunting. SNAP can provide nine times the amount of meals as the entire nationwide food bank network. There's no business in the country, no corporation that could grow nine times its size or capacity in one year, let alone by Nov. 1."</p> <p>With the impasse on Capitol Hill growing seemingly deeper the longer the shutdown continues, individual states are investigating what they can offer to help bridge the food assistance gap.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Political fallout</h3> <p>Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican, has introduced a bill that would provide appropriations for the Department of Agriculture to provide SNAP benefits during any lapse because of the shutdown. That bill currently has ten GOP co-sponsors and one Democratic co-sponsor, Peter Welch of Vermont. There's no commitment from leadership to bring it up for a vote, yet.</p>
<p>Even if the government acts before Nov. 1, it will likely take at least a few days to get SNAP benefits distributed to states, and then onto debit-like cards that recipients use to purchase food.</p> <p>In the meantime, more than two dozen Democratic attorneys general and three Democratic governors are suing the Trump administration over the suspension of food benefits.</p> <p>As the shutdown drags on, both parties seem convinced they will receive less of the public blame.</p> <p>But Rich Thau, president of Engagious, a firm specializing in public policy message testing, said what he's hearing from the public is "a pox on both your houses."</p> <p>As part of his swing voter project, Thau talks monthly with voters in key swing states who swung from former President Joe Biden to President Trump. In a recent focus group in Pennsylvania, Thau said nine of the 13 participants blamed both parties equally for the shutdown.</p> <p>"When I turn the news on, I hear, 'the Republicans are blaming the Democrats. The Democrats are blaming the Republicans,'" said Brenda S., 60, a participant from Philadelphia, PA whose last name was not provided in the focus group setting, as is common practice for these surveys. "It's both of their faults. They don't care about us."</p> <p>The SNAP cliff represents one of the biggest impacts of the shutdown, which has been marked by the White House attempting to stave off some of the traditional shutdown pain points, like paychecks for servicemembers.</p> <p>If SNAP benefits are delayed for the month of November, Thau said he does not know<strong> </strong>which party is more able to build a compelling narrative about why lawmakers couldn't reach a deal and fund the government.</p> <p>"Who's going to sound more persuasive to someone when it comes to who's to blame for this?" he told NPR. "If you're a member of Congress, you don't want your constituents starving because you can't reopen the government. But by the same token, if you think that this is a winnable fight and you're in no rush to reopen the government because somehow you think your side is winning — and if both sides feel that way — the inertia will continue."</p>
<p>He added: "I imagine each side has some strategy that causes them to think the other side is going to blink first. But they're playing with fire."</p>

<div class="article-title">How will the dismantling of USAID affect U.S. relief efforts in Jamaica?</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>It's a major international disaster. And it comes in the wake of the Trump administration's dismantling of the world's largest aid agency, the United States Agency for International Development, along with the slashing of billions of dollars in foreign assistance.</p> <p>Hurricane Melissa, the most powerful Atlantic storm of this year, has torn through Jamaica and several other islands in the Caribbean, leaving a trail of devastation. With major flooding and power outages, Prime Minister Andrew Holness has declared the country a "disaster area."</p> <p>The State Department confirmed that Jamaica has formally asked for help. And President Trump told reporters on Wednesday that the U.S. will respond: "We're watching it closely, and we're prepared to move."</p>
<p>Will the U.S. be able to meet the needs of Jamaica and other affected island nations?</p> <p>NPR spoke to half a dozen experts in disaster relief. They all noted that hurricane Melissa is is a real test for U.S. disaster response capabilities since the shutdown of USAID.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Here's are key points to consider:</p> <p><strong>USAID was the lead federal agency coordinating disaster response but no longer exists.</strong></p> <p>The agency had a staff of about 800 people trained in disaster relief and a road map for handling disasters like Melissa. For disasters like this epic hurricane, preparations would have started months in advance.</p> <p>"USAID would have been working with governments and embassies in the region on preparing for hurricane season," says Sarah Charles, who led USAID's Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance during the Biden administration. "And this would have been everything from exercises with emergency management authorities in different countries [and aid groups], to pre-positioning stocks of things like plastic sheeting, emergency food, household item kits warehouses in places like Miami, but also in particular countries like Haiti, which is very vulnerable to storms of this nature."</p> <p>The agency would also often send out staff ahead of a predicted disaster like Melissa to be on the ground before airports or roads were closed.</p>
<p>USAID also coordinated efforts with the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as with charities and organizations led by immigrants to the U.S. from the affected places, who often have a good handle on the needs of communities in their home countries.</p> <p>In the wake of the aid cuts, these efforts have been largely eliminated.</p> <p><strong>The State Department is stepping in but there are concerns about its capabilities.</strong></p> <p>After the shutdown of USAID on July 1, about 100 of USAID's disaster response staff survived the transition and are working in the State Department's Bureau of Population Refugees and Migration, which is responsible for humanitarian aid.</p> <p>And the State Department is now mounting a response.</p> <p>"The United States is in close contact with the governments of Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic and The Bahamas as they confront the devastating impacts of Hurricane Melissa. We have rescue and response teams heading to affected areas along with critical lifesaving supplies," said Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a post on X on Wednesday.</p> <p>Brian Heidel, who's worked as a humanitarian for more than two decades and led USAID's Caribbean teams, says the announcement is a "welcome sign" and describes an effective way to deal with a disaster of this magnitude.</p> <p>It's also important to note that the country where a disaster takes place takes the lead in establishing the type of aid needed.</p> <p>In this case, says Sarah Charles, the Jamaican government will likely want U.S. help with emergency food and supplies and transportation to bring such aid to remote areas as well as damage assessment.</p> <p>"So, using our technology to do damage assessments and sharing those with the government, supporting their communication and logistics, all with the aim of helping the Jamaican government get to those that are the most cut off and the most vulnerable," she says.</p>
<p>Nonetheless there are concerns about the U.S. ability to coordinate the expected response.</p> <p>Experts interviewed also cautioned that the State Department is bureaucratic and has systems and operating procedures that were not built with disaster relief in mind. So things could take longer.</p> <p>"So many of USAID's systems came out of, frankly, the negative experiences of the Haiti earthquake, where people both in and out of the government were so moved by the devastation that a lot of help flooded in, but in a totally uncoordinated way that created more chaos and challenges in the response," says Sarah Charles, adding that the agency's expertise built over decades may not have survived the administration's cuts.</p> <p>Then there's the matter of the budget upheaval. Heidel says the cuts to programs and staff limits the capability for the U.S. to respond to new disasters that can happen anywhere, "because they're spread so very thin on all of the pre-existing disasters. Obviously, there's so much going on worldwide and in the Middle East and in Africa," he says.</p> <p>And with all the cuts, he says that there's simply "no way that the U.S. government is going to be able to provide a major level of support that they have provided in the past."</p>

<div class="article-title">DHS calls for defending American culture. That leaves some Latinos rattled</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>If you were to base your entire knowledge of American current events solely on the social media feeds of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS),<strong> </strong>you could easily conclude that the U.S. is at war. Earlier this month, a recruitment video featured on the agency's social media platforms urged viewers to join ICE, stating: "under the leadership of President Trump and Secretary Noem, we've reclaimed our border, secured our nation, and have begun to deport these foreign invaders. Equally important as the task of securing our borders is the task of defending our culture - and what it means to be an American." </p>
<p>The video is part of a social media and advertising blitz to build public support for the current crackdown, and recruit new immigration agents. Homeland Security's stated mission is law enforcement, immigration, travel security and cybersecurity. Its campaign calling for the protection of American culture from invaders has raised eyebrows, and prompted accusations by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch Project, of promoting a White, Christian nationalist agenda.</p> <p>Consider the agency's Instagram, which has nearly half a million followers: it's a potpourri of pop culture memes, action film quality videos of ICE raids, and paintings of white settlers expanding West as Native Americans flee into the shadows. There's also a lot<em> </em>of re-imagined vintage World War II style posters, often featuring Uncle Sam calling on Americans to join ICE.<strong>  </strong></p>
<p>Julio Anta, a graphic novelist, says the vintage quality evokes "the good old days of America, back when America was great." The World War II themes, he says, are a call to arms, "trying to inspire this newer generation to see this fight against immigrants as something in line with the greatest generation [who fought in the second World War]."</p> <p>There's a long history of illustrations demonizing immigrants in America. In the late 1800's and early 1900's, editorial<strong> </strong>cartoons regularly attacked Irish, Italian, Chinese and Jewish immigrants. There's an infamous 19th century newspaper cartoon of Uncle Sam hovering angrily over a melting pot, the caption reads: "we can't digest the scum." In another  illustration from 1911, a burly immigrant shines a shoe, the caption is a racial slur for Italians and how much garlic they eat.</p>
<p>Anta notes that DHS's social media artwork today almost entirely features White Americans and a romanticized past. "When I look at these images, I see predominantly white people in it. This is all about a time when society was great for white people, and trying to bring it back to that time again."<strong> </strong></p>
<p>NPR reached out multiple times to DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin with detailed questions about their social media campaign. She did not respond.</p> <p>Anta, the son of Cuban and Colombian immigrants, says he's disheartened by the images. He says the rhetoric, combined with the<strong> </strong>mass arrests of undocumented immigrants, at times with little or no due process<strong>,</strong> has made him feel unsafe right now as a Latino man. He carries a picture of his passport with him in case he gets stopped. He's taken aback by the recent DHS's recruitment ad which affirms that "we know what it means to be an American. Everyone knows what an American is."</p> <p>"I think when I was growing up I might have felt included by that statement," says Anta. "I was raised to see America as this place that was made up of immigrants, and that the cultures that we all brought made this country a better place. And now we don't even get that."</p> <p>42 percent of Latino voters elected Trump, a historic number for a Republican presidential candidate. But about a year into his presidency, polls show a changing picture:  a recent New York Times/Sienna poll show 69% of Hispanics disapprove of the President.</p> <p>The same poll shows 26 percent of Latinos <em>do </em>support Trump.</p> <p>Among them, Peter Gonzalez, a 66 year old who lives in Tallahassee, Florida. He says he voted for President Trump in large part because he says he wanted illegal immigration controlled. His own parents are Cuban immigrants, but he emphasizes - they<em>  </em>came to the U.S. legally.<em> </em></p> <p>"I have no problem with immigrants coming into this country," Gonzalez says. "We are all immigrants. But there's a process, there's procedures, there's background checks. All that stuff needs to be done."</p> <p>Gonzalez, a retired Coast Guardsman, supports the ongoing immigration enforcement campaign. Gonzalez identifies as Hispanic and white, but says he's no stranger to anti-Latino racism—he faced it growing up. Still, he insists the DHS rhetoric isn't about race. It's about enforcing immigration law. "I don't feel targeted. I mean, everybody knows my last name. They know that I'm bilingual. I don't feel that the administration is targeting Latinos."</p>
<p>Gonzalez rarely uses social media. In fact, our interview marked the first time he'd seen DHS's Instagram recruitment posts. Scrolling through them, his discomfort becomes evident. "Protect your homeland, defend your culture," he repeats aloud. "Why? I'm ok with 'protect your homeland', meaning illegal criminals coming in. But the second part…" He stops. "'Defend your culture'? I don't agree with that. American culture is all cultures."</p> <p>Gonzalez says he still supports President Trump's immigration crackdown.</p> <p>But, as with many Latinos, this kind of messaging he says just doesn't sit right, and he finds it confusing. Julio Anta says, there's no question about it, he doesn't feel included in the recent DHS assertion that "everyone knows what an American is." "I think when the majority of people see me or my family, it's not that white mono culture they're trying to portray." But Anta wonders, what if the statement was flipped on its head? "We know an American when we see them, that could be an extremely empowering statement: that an American can be anyone, of any race, of any culture, of any generation in migration." But the way it's written now, he says, "it puts a target on our backs".<br/></p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The White House has fired six members of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the independent federal agency that advises the president and Congress on design plans for monuments, memorials, coins and federal buildings. The seven member commission is made up of experts in architecture, art, urban and landscape design. Since its creation in 1910, the commission has reviewed plans for everything from Arlington National Cemetery to Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial.</p> <p>As first reported by <em>The Washington Post</em>, the commissioners who were terminated are Bruce Redman Becker, Peter D. Cook, Lisa E. Delplace, William J. Lenihan, Justin Garrett Moore and vice chair Hazel Ruth Edwards. The chair position, now vacant, was held by Billie Tsien, one of the architects working on the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago. Lenihan confirmed in an email to NPR the six were terminated "effective immediately."</p>
<p>In an email to NPR, the White House said it is "preparing to appoint a new slate of members to the commission that are more aligned with President Trump's America First Policies."</p> <p>The commissioners would have advised President Trump on his anticipated White House ballroom and his plans for a monument similar to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, which he says will celebrate the 250th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. In an email to NPR, architect Bruce Redman Becker, one of the commissioners who was fired, wrote that "Neither project has been submitted for review yet."</p> <p>President Trump has not yet announced who the new commissioners will be. During his first term, Justin Shubow, founder and president of the National Civic Art Society served as chair and White House ballroom architect James McCrery was one of its commissioners.</p> <p>In 2021, President Biden fired four commissioners who'd been appointed by Trump in his first term, including Shubow. Like Trump, Shubow is a champion of traditional and classical architecture.</p> <p>The White House has not yet responded to NPR's request for comment.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Teens who use weed before age 15 have more trouble later, a study finds</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Teens who start using cannabis before age 15 are more likely to use the drug often later in their lives. They are also more likely to develop mental and physical health problems in young adulthood compared to their peers who did not use the drug in adolescence.</p> <p>Those are the findings of a new study in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>.</p> <p>"This further builds the case that cannabis use in adolescence adversely affects the [health] trajectories of those who use it," says psychiatrist Dr. Ryan Sultan at Columbia University, who wasn't involved in the new research.</p> <p>The new study used data from the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development. Researchers in Montreal, Canada, have been following more than 1,500 kids since birth into young adulthood to understand the factors that influence their development and their health. Among the various aspects of the kids' lives and habits scientists have recorded is cannabis use between ages 12 and 17.</p>
<p>The researchers found that a majority of teens — 60% — didn't use cannabis in adolescence. Among the remaining 40%, half started using cannabis in their late teens and by the time they turned 17, they used the drug infrequently — less than once a month. The remaining 20% started using marijuana before they turned 15, and by age 17, they were using it at least once a month.</p> <p> This last group was more likely to seek health care in young adulthood for both mental and physical health conditions compared to those who didn't use the drug as young teens.</p> <p>"The risk is concentrated among those who start early and use frequently," says psychologist and the study's main author Massimiliano Orri at McGill University.</p> <p>Early, frequent cannabis users had a 51% higher chance of seeking care for mental health problems in young adulthood compared to those who didn't use the drug. And that risk was calculated after controlling for a range of confounding factors that are known to influence health, like bullying or lack of parental involvement.</p> <p>Similarly, early and frequent users of cannabis had an 86% higher chance of needing care for physical health needs.</p>
<p>"We have some indication that respiratory problems were most frequently reported and also accidents and unintentional injuries," says Orri.</p> <p>These physical health problems may have to do with intoxication from cannabis, but could also be due to withdrawal symptoms, write Orri and his colleagues in the paper.</p> <p>"That certainly makes sense," says psychologist Krista Lisdahl at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who also studies teenage brain development and health, but wasn't involved in the new research. "It's alarming and something that we really need to be tracking more closely here in the United States as well."</p>
<p>A major strength of the study is that Orri and his colleagues controlled for so many confounding factors, adds Lisdahl.</p> <p>"There are a lot of factors that are co-linked with physical health as well as mental health," says Lisdahl. And the new study controlled for many of them, including "family, parental conflict and parenting style, as well as parental monitoring of the teens." They also looked at factors at the individual level like social skills, peer relationships and whether a kid was victimized by peers.</p> <p>Prior studies have also found a link between teen cannabis use and a higher risk of developing mental health symptoms.</p> <p>Sultan's recent research found a two to four times higher likelihood of developing psychiatric disorders for teens who used cannabis recreationally compared to adolescents who don't use the drug at all. Other studies have suggested a link between early cannabis use and psychosis in youth. He and his colleagues also found a higher risk of other impacts like poorer grades and truancy.</p>
<p>"The adolescent brain is continuing to develop in a very dynamic fashion during the adolescent period and all the way into young adulthood," says Lisdahl. "Using something like cannabis regularly during this period might disrupt that healthy neural development, especially in areas of the brain that are related to executive functioning, which is like problem-solving, planning, maybe controlling other kinds of behaviors and impulses, but also emotion regulation," she says.</p> <p>Take for example, a teen who's prone to anxiety who turns to cannabis to feel less anxious, says Sultan. "If you start to do that on a regular basis, this is now your method for managing your anxiety," he says. "This becomes your coping skill and you become atrophied in any ability to manage it in another way."</p> <p>The same thing can happen for someone who uses cannabis to manage their mood, he adds.</p>
