<div class="article-title">Milei scores historic win in Argentina midterms, tightens grip on Congress</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Argentine President Javier Milei secured a decisive victory Sunday in midterm elections, expanding his control of Congress and giving his government fresh momentum to push forward with deep spending cuts and sweeping free-market reforms.</p><p>The result gives Milei’s libertarian movement a boost and marks another sharp turn for one of Latin America’s largest and most volatile economies.</p><p>Milei’s party, La Libertad Avanza, won about 41.5% of the vote in Buenos Aires province, a historic upset in a region long dominated by the Peronist opposition. The rival coalition took 40.8%, according to figures cited by Reuters and The Associated Press.</p><p>Nationwide, La Libertad Avanza increased its seats in the lower house from 37 to 64, positioning Milei to more easily defend his vetoes and executive decrees that have defined his economic agenda.</p><p>"The result is better than even the most optimistic Milei supporters were hoping for," Marcelo Garcia, Americas director at the risk-analysis firm Horizon Engage, said in comments reported by Reuters. "With this result, Milei will be able to easily defend his decrees and vetoes in Congress."</p><p>Political consultant Gustavo Cordoba told Reuters the outcome reflected a cautious optimism among voters who appear willing to give Milei’s economic policies more time.</p><p>"Many people were willing to give the government another chance," Cordoba said. "The triumph is unobjectionable, unquestionable."</p><p>Reuters reported that inflation has fallen from 12.8% before Milei’s inauguration to 2.1% last month. His government has also posted a fiscal surplus and pushed through broad deregulation measures — a dramatic reversal after years of economic turbulence.</p><p>According to The Associated Press, the U.S. government under President Donald Trump offered Argentina a $40 billion aid package, including a $20 billion currency swap and a proposed $20 billion debt-investment facility, after tying future U.S. support to Milei’s performance in the midterms.</p><p>President Donald Trump congratulated Milei on Truth Social Sunday night, writing: "Congratulations to President Javier Milei on his Landslide Victory in Argentina. He is doing a wonderful job! Our confidence in him was justified by the People of Argentina."</p><p>Investors reacted positively to the results. Reuters reported that Argentine bonds and stocks are expected to rally as Milei’s stronger hand in Congress gives him the political capital to accelerate his reforms</p><p>Milei called the election "a turning point for Argentina," according to AFP via the Times of Israel.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Packers' Tucker Kraft, Jordan Love torch Steelers, spoil Aaron Rodgers' hopes to make history</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Tucker Kraft was eating good on Sunday night as he and Jordan Love led the Green Bay Packers to a win over the frustrated Pittsburgh Steelers, 35-25.</p><p>Love and Kraft hooked up early and often. The first connection came in the first quarter when Love found the tight end for a 16-yard touchdown pass to cap off a six-play, 67-yard drive.</p><p>The Steelers were being buoyed by Chris Boswell’s impressive field goal kicking and an Aaron Rodgers touchdown pass to DK Metcalf. Pittsburgh took a 16-7 lead into halftime. Love came back out and didn’t miss a beat.</p><p>Love threw another touchdown pass to Kraft and a third to Savion Williams to guide the Packers back to the front. Josh Jacobs scored in the fourth quarter from three yards out. Once the Packers took the lead, the defense never let up.</p><p>Rodgers came into the game making sure not to play up the first matchup of his career against the team that selected him in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He looked back fondly on his time with the Packers throughout the week leading up to the game.</p><p>He probably wished things went a little differently.</p><p>There were times when Rodgers showed just how excellent he continues to be at 41 years old. He made terrific throws to Metcalf and Roman Wilson at points in the night and was even able to bait the Packers’ secondary into a pass interference call during a crucial touchdown drive.</p><p>But there were also times when he was visibly frustrated with teammates. He was pressured all night by linebackers Micah Parsons and Rashan Gary and the offense didn’t jibe well for the most part. He was seeking to become the fifth quarterback in NFL history to beat all 32 teams in a career.</p><p>Some of the tensions the Steelers players had boiled over on the field. During a Steelers kickoff, Pittsburgh’s Ben Skowronek was double-teamed by two Packers players. Nick Herbig came over to defend Skowronek and pushed Bo Melton to the ground. It kicked off a brief skirmish that saw two officials get caught up in it.</p><p>Later, Metcalf sparred with Packers linebacker Quay Walker. The wide receiver put his fingers into Walker’s facemask. He was called for unnecessary roughness and stymied the Steelers’ offense.</p><p>Green Bay will take a win back home and improve to 5-1-1. The Steelers fell to 4-3, which will tighten the race for the AFC North as the midway point of the season nears.</p><p>Love finished 29-of-37 with 360 passing yards and three touchdown passes. Kraft had seven catches for 143 yards and two scores.</p><p>Rodgers was 24-of-36 with two touchdown passes and 219 passing yards. Wilson and Metcalf each had touchdowns.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Authorities in the country of Georgia say they have disrupted a major nuclear smuggling attempt involving several Chinese nationals accused of trying to buy uranium on the black market, according to the Associated Press (AP).</p><p>The State Security Service of Georgia (SSSG) announced Saturday that three Chinese citizens were detained in Tbilisi while attempting to illegally purchase roughly 4.4 pounds of uranium for $400,000, according to the outlet.</p><p>Officials said the suspects were planning to traffic the nuclear material to China via Russia, the outlet reported. </p><p>"Three Chinese citizens have been detained in Tbilisi while attempting to illegally purchase 2 kilograms of nuclear material — uranium," the agency said, according to the AP. </p><p>Video footage released by the agency shows security officers in the Georgian capital seizing bottles containing what was identified as uranium and arresting multiple individuals at the scene.</p><p>According to the SSSG, one of the suspects had overstayed his visa and was living in Georgia illegally, the AP said. He allegedly led efforts to locate and acquire the radioactive substance, even bringing in experts from abroad to assist, the outlet added. Other members of the group reportedly coordinated the operation from China.</p><p>The perpetrators were identified and detained while "negotiating the details of the illegal transaction," the security service reportedly said.</p><p>The agency did not specify when the arrests occurred or provide the identities of the suspects.</p><p>The latest arrests follow a similar case in July, when Georgian authorities detained a foreign national and a Georgian citizen accused of planning to sell uranium worth $3 million. Officials said that material could have been used to construct explosive devices or carry out terrorist attacks.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>NFL legend Adrian Peterson can’t seem to stay out of trouble. </p><p>The former Minnesota Vikings star was arrested in Texas Sunday morning for driving while intoxicated, a Class B misdemeanor, and also hit with a Class A misdemeanor weapons charge, according to Fort Bend County jail records.</p><p>The 40-year-old was taken into custody around 10 a.m. and remained jailed as of Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Peterson was also arrested in April after the NFL Draft — just hours after attending the Vikings’ draft-night celebration — when he blew a 0.14 BAC after being pulled over in Richfield, MN. Peterson was reportedly driving 83 miles per hour in a 55 MPH zone.</p><p>A surefire Hall of Fame running back, Peterson was named NFL MVP in 2012 after rushing for more than 2,000 yards. He earned seven Pro Bowl selections during his 15-season career and ranks fifth on the league’s all-time rushing yards list.</p><p>He has previously been arrested for an altercation with his wife in 2022 and in separate child-support and assault cases.</p><p>Earlier this year, Peterson also made headlines after getting into a poker-related fight at a Houston social club. The viral video of the scuffle with Joe "Baby Joe" Castaneda later led to plans for a Celebrity Boxing match between the two. </p><p>Another run-in with the law only further clouds the legacy of one of the NFL’s greatest running backs.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Two of the three victims killed in a fiery semi-truck crash allegedly caused by an illegal alien in Southern California on Tuesday have been identified as an assistant basketball coach and his wife.</p><p>The San Bernardino County Coroner's office identified two of the victims in the crash as 76-year-old Clarence Nelson of Fontana, and his wife, 69-year-old Lisa Nelson, saying both were pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>State senator Susan Rubio said in a Facebook post that Nelson was the basketball coach at Pomona High School in Pomona, California.</p><p>"This week, our community was deeply saddened by the tragic incident in the City of Ontario," Rubio said. "It’s heartbreaking to learn that two of the lives lost were from my district — Pomona High School basketball coach Clarence Nelson and his wife Lisa."</p><p>"As a teacher, I know how a loss like this ripples through an entire school community," she continued. "My heart goes out to their families, the Pomona Unified School District, and everyone mourning this tremendous loss."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the school, though officials declined to comment.</p><p>The driver, 21-year-old Jashanpreet Singh, is an illegal immigrant from India who crossed the southern border in 2022 and was released by the Biden administration; he is now accused of causing the semi-truck crash that killed three people.</p><p>According to federal sources, Singh was first encountered by Border Patrol agents in California’s El Centro Sector in March 2022 and released into the interior pending an immigration hearing.</p><p>Authorities say Singh was arrested on suspicion of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated after plowing his big rig into slow-moving traffic on the I-10 Freeway in San Bernardino County.</p><p>The crash, which was caught on dashcam video, left at least three people dead and several others injured.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Police officers swarmed a 16-year-old high school student last week after an artificial intelligence (AI) gun detection system mistakenly flagged his bag of chips as a firearm, leaving officials and students shaken.</p><p>Student Taki Allen was waiting for his ride at Kenwood High School in Essex, Maryland, last Monday when he placed an empty bag of chips in his pocket, according to WMAR-2 News. Moments later, police officers suddenly surrounded him, ordering him to the ground and handcuffing him, the local station reported. </p><p>Body camera footage released by the Baltimore Police Department shows responding officers realizing that the school’s AI security system, which monitors video in real time, had mistakenly flagged a bag of chips as a gun, triggering the law enforcement response.</p><p>"Police showed up, like eight cop cars, and then they all came out with guns pointed at me talking about getting on the ground. I was putting my hands up like, ‘What’s going on?’" Allen told WMAR-2.</p><p>According to the video, police officers then reviewed the video flagged by the AI system, traced the item to a nearby trash can and discovered that the supposed weapon was just a bag of chips.</p><p>"I guess just the way you guys were eating chips… It picked it up as a gun," a police officer told the students in the video. "AI's not the best."</p><p>The Oct. 20 incident has left students, city officials and school administrators asking who was responsible for the traumatic incident. </p><p>During a conference call, Superintendent Dr. Myriam Rogers said the alert had initially been canceled, but the school principal had already begun coordinating a police response.</p><p>"The alert was cancelled by the BCPS (Baltimore County Public Schools) Safety Team. The principal, who did not see the cancellation, contacted our School Resource Officer," Baltimore County told Fox News Digital on Sunday, referring to a BCPS statement. </p><p>Ultimately, the system functioned as intended, Rogers told WMAR-2. </p><p>"The program is based on human verification and in this case the program did what it was supposed to do, which was to signal an alert and for humans to take a look to find out if there was cause for concern in that moment," Rogers said.</p><p>Omnilert told Fox News Digital their system combines both artificial intelligence with human verification before any escalation.</p><p>"Our system operated as designed — it identified a possible threat, elevated it for human review, and relied on authorized safety personnel for final determination," the company told Fox News Digital, adding that the object was later confirmed not to be a firearm and the alert was marked as resolved.</p><p>From that point forward, Omnilert had no further involvement in any subsequent actions or decisions related to this event."</p><p>Allen, shaken by the incident, said he no longer feels safe going outside after football practice and that the incident should never have happened.</p><p>"I don't think no chip bag should be mistaken for a gun at all" Allen told WMAR-2. </p><p>"I don't want - don't think I'm safe enough to go outside, especially eating a bag of chips or drinking something. I just stay inside until my ride comes," Allen added.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Democratic Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson erupted at a reporter on Friday after they used the term "illegal aliens" during a press briefing, slamming the phrase as "racist" and "nasty."</p><p>In a video posted Saturday to the official Instagram account of the Chicago mayor, a reporter asked Johnson about a report on city spending related to "illegal aliens" in Chicago that he was allegedly required to file with the White House. </p><p>Johnson immediately pushed back on the language.</p><p>"We don't have illegal aliens," Johnson said to the reporter. "I don't know if that's from some sort of sci-fi message that you wish you've had… Well listen, the legal term for my people were slaves. You want me to use that term too? So, look, let's just get the language right. We're talking about undocumented individuals that are human beings."</p><p>Johnson added that he would not "accept that type of racist, nasty language to describe human beings."</p><p>The blue city's mayor then shifted to discuss his administration's spending priorities, touting his $16.7 billion budget that he said invests in education, transportation, housing, environmental justice, youth employment and community safety.</p><p>"And we are going to challenge the ultra-wealthy to pay their fair share," Johnson said.</p><p>Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., then chimed in to back Johnson's remarks, arguing that immigration violations are not criminal offenses.</p><p>"It is very important that people in Illinois and across the country understand the immigration system is a civil system," Jayapal said. "Undocumented presence in the United States is not a criminal offense. And so thank you for the clarification on language."</p><p>Johnson has previously been outspoken in his defense of Chicago’s immigration policies and in his criticism of President Donald Trump’s approach to crime and border enforcement. </p><p>Last month, the Chicago mayor delivered a fiery news conference condemning Trump’s crackdown on crime.</p><p>"Jails and incarceration and law enforcement is a sickness that has not led to safe communities," Johnson said at the time.</p><p>Last week, three illegal immigrants and six U.S. citizens were arrested in the Chicago area in what the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) dubbed "one of the most violent days" of Operation Midway Blitz. </p><p>Operation Midway Blitz was launched last month in honor of Katie Abraham, who was killed in a drunk driving hit-and-run allegedly caused by Julio Cucul-Bol, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala. </p><p>DHS stated the goal of the operation was to "target criminal illegal aliens terrorizing Americans in sanctuary Illinois."</p><p>The Chicago mayor's office and Rep.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The New York Giants lost some momentum early in their loss to the Philadelphia Eagles after a turnover was taken away thanks to an early whistle on a Jalen Hurts tush push.</p><p>Two plays later, the Eagles went up 14-7 on a Hurts touchdown pass to Saquon Barkley. Philadelphia won the game 38-20 and kept up its dominance against the Giants at Lincoln Financial Field.</p><p>It was pass rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux who ripped the ball away from Hurts as the whistle was blown to signal the end of the play. Referee Brad Rogers said Hurts’ forward progress was stopped before Thibodeaux made the play. However, Hurts was still driving up the field and hadn’t touched the ground yet with any parts of his body.</p><p>"(The official) said they called the forward progress before he reached the ball out," Thibodeaux told reporters, via ESPN. "Sounds like some bulls--- to me."</p><p>After teammate Brian Burns reminded Thibodeaux that he could get fined for his tough comments on the officiating, he changed his tune and acknowledged that officials had a tough job.</p><p>"Sorry, I mean, that was a great call by the refs. You can't blame missed calls on anything. I think we didn't stop the run. They made the 50-50 balls and they got the best of us," he added.</p><p>Thibodeaux had five tackles, a deflection and a QB hit.</p><p>The tush push has been a hotly debated topic over the course of the year.</p><p>In the last meeting between the two teams, the Eagles ran the tush push four straight times in one of their touchdown drives. New York ended up winning that game earlier this month.</p><p>NFL owners have been under pressure to ban the play. It survived a vote that would have prohibited the call during the offseason. It’s expected to be revisited next year.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Washington Post editorial board defends Trump's White House ballroom construction project</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Washington Post editorial board defended President Donald Trump's ballroom construction on Sunday and argued that the next Democratic president would be happy to have the ballroom.</p><p>"In classic Trump fashion, the president is pursuing a reasonable idea in the most jarring manner possible. Privately, many alumni of the Biden and Obama White Houses acknowledge the long-overdue need for an event space like what Trump is creating. It is absurd that tents need to be erected on the South Lawn for state dinners, and VIPs are forced to use porta-potties," the editorial board wrote.</p><p>Construction crews began demolition of the East Wing of the White House on Monday, which angered top Democrats and liberal media figures.</p><p>"The State Dining Room seats 140. The East Room seats about 200. Trump says the ballroom at the center of his 90,000-square-foot addition will accommodate 999 guests. The next Democratic president will be happy to have this," the editorial board continued.</p><p>Figures, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.; former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre; former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; Chelsea Clinton; and CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert accused Trump of dishonoring the White House after his construction crews bulldozed part of the East Wing of the building on Monday.</p><p>"The people’s house is basically being sold to the highest bidder," Jean-Pierre said on ABC’s "The View" on Tuesday. "It is corruption at its core."</p><p>The editors argued that the White House didn't need to jump through bureaucratic hoops for construction.</p><p>Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., argued that any Democrat running for president in 2028, needs to vow to destroy the ballroom on day one. </p><p>"Prominent Democrats have become vocal this year in calling out their party’s lawyerly obsession with process, which combined with a not in my backyard (NIMBY) mentality, has prevented a place such as California from building a high-speed rail project that its voters approved by referendum in 2008," the editors said.</p><p>The Washington Post also said that the project likely wouldn't have gotten done if Trump had gone through the traditional process.</p><p>"The blueprints would have faced death by a thousand papercuts," they wrote.</p><p>The editors also argued that the White House needed to evolve with the times.</p><p>"The White House cannot simply be a museum to the past. Like America, it must evolve with the times to maintain its greatness. Strong leaders reject calcification. In that way, Trump’s undertaking is a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere," the editors wrote.</p><p><i>Fox News' Gabriel Hays contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>It's out with the old, and in with the new for Sydney Sweeney. </p><p>The 28-year-old actress, who is known for her long, golden locks, debuted a new haircut during the AFI screening of her film "Christy" at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California, on Saturday. </p><p>Sweeney, who was wearing a soft pink gown, was all smiles as she rocked her new bob look.</p><p>In an interview with Vogue, her hair team, colorist Jacob Schwartz and hairstylist Glen Coco, opened up about the transformation. </p><p>"Sydney was looking for a change and wanted to have a big hair moment for the red carpet to support her new movie, Christy," said Schwartz. "It felt like the perfect time to do something bold."</p><p>"This is a transformation," Coco added. "Christy has a lot of underlying tones of resilience, transformation, and power. Sydney herself transformed herself for this role, and I wanted to morph her into this updated version of herself in real life. Something new and fresh to close out the rest of the year."</p><p>The fresh haircut comes months after Sweeney called off her engagement to longtime partner, film producer Jonathan Davino, 41. </p><p>The "Euphoria" star revealed that she was single and no longer planning a wedding during an interview with The Times of London, ending months of speculation that she and Davino had split. </p><p>"I’m learning a lot about myself, spending more time with my friends.

<div class="article-title">'Bugonia' Review: A twisted tale in the current age of conspiracy theories</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Conspiracy theories have become more than a harmless hobby for certain folks. They go down online rabbit holes and choose their own truths versus what's actually reality. To conspiracists, everything presented to them only reinforces what they believe, becoming part of their identity.</p><p>"Bugonia" is a reflection of the times we live in.</p><p>Yorgos Lanthimos' latest — an English-language remake of the 2003 South Korean flick "Save the Green Planet!" — follows Teddy Gatz (Jesse Plemons), a paranoid beekeeper and a package scanner for the pharmaceutical giant Auxolith, who plots to kidnap the company's CEO Michelle Fuller (Emma Stone), someone who he thinks is an alien hellbent on destroying Earth. </p><p>Fuller is an Elizabeth Holmes-type boss — robotic-sounding to her staff, always wearing the same white blouse and black jacket as seen in several magazine covers and framed photos, obsessed with wellness. </p><p>Teddy is a leader in his own right, too. He's a one-man "human resistance" as he calls himself, two if you count his cousin Don (Aidan Delbis), serving as a loyal henchman of sorts. Don expresses his concerns about getting caught, to which Teddy assures him, "No one on Earth gives a single f--- about us." </p><p>Disguising in comical Jennifer Aniston paper masks they find at a store, Teddy and Don carry out the mission and abduct Fuller (who puts up a good fight, briefly) outside her home and take her back to his house in the middle of nowhere. Teddy orders Don to shave an unconscious Fuller's hair. Her hair helps her communicate with her home planet, of course. </p><p>As Fuller is chained in the basement, the normally unkempt Teddy and Don dress up in suits as they are in the presence of a high-ranking alien official. Teddy demands Fuller take them to her mothership, accusing her of killing his family, co-workers and the bees.</p><p>Fuller humorously maintains her business-like composure, telling Teddy, "I hear where you're coming from, but I respectfully disagree." The high-powered honcho also warns him that the police will track them down, saying her abduction is like that of a governor, "but worse."</p><p>The dynamic between Teddy and Don is a compelling one. Teddy presents himself as Don’s protector (Don, like Delbis in real life, is autistic). He promises Don people will think he's a hero if they carry out their plan, yet Don is the voice of reason as he expresses quiet skepticism towards Teddy's warped reality. </p><p>"Bugonia" marks Stone's fourth collaboration with Lanthimos — she won her second Oscar for 2023's "Poor Things." Per usual, she is superb in the role of Michelle Fuller, the out-of-touch executive who subtly modifies her strategy in hopes of escaping captivity. </p><p>However, the film really belongs to her co-star. Despite not being a household name, Jesse Plemons has had a remarkable career. An Oscar nominee himself, Plemons has appeared in more than half a dozen Best Picture nominated-films in the past decade, but audiences may recognize him best from his stint on "Breaking Bad." Here, Plemons gives his greatest performance as a deeply disturbed man in pursuit of what he thinks is a noble mission. </p><p>Lanthimos has become one of my favorite contemporary filmmakers. His unique storytelling combines the bizarre and bleak with intensity and humor (see "The Lobster" (2015), "The Favourite" (2018), "Poor Things," etc.) His films are a breath of fresh air, carving out his own lane that very few can. </p><p>Aiding the Greek director are the striking camerawork of cinematographer Robbie Ryan — twice Oscar-nominated for "The Favourite" and "Poor Things" — and the biting screenplay from Will Tracy. English composer Jerskin Fendrix delivers a score that hits you like a tidal wave when you least expect it. </p><p>"Bugonia" is a twisted satire that captures the delusional grip of conspiracy culture in today’s discourse. Gritty, thrilling, and darkly funny, Lanthimos' latest may not be his crowning achievement, but it’s another strong entry in his filmography — and proof he’s one of the most visionary directors working today.</p><p><i>"Bugonia" is rated R for bloody violent content including a suicide, grisly images and language. Running time: 1 hour, 58 minutes. In select theaters, wide release October 31, 2025.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

Both aviators were transported back to the Nimitz and are reported to be in stable condition.</p><p>The U.S. Pacific Fleet said in a statement that all five service members involved in the crashes are safe and accounted for.</p><p>The causes of both incidents remain under investigation, and the Navy has not released additional details about weather conditions, possible mechanical issues, or the nature of the training missions being conducted at the time of the crashes.</p><p>While investigators work to determine what led to the two mishaps, operations aboard the USS Nimitz have continued as the carrier remains deployed in the Indo-Pacific region.</p><p>The Nimitz—the Navy’s oldest active aircraft carrier—is serving as the centerpiece of Carrier Strike Group 11, which routinely conducts freedom-of-navigation and maritime security operations in the South China Sea, waters that have become increasingly contested amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China.</p><p>The incidents come as the Nimitz undertakes its final deployment, capping more than 50 years of service since its commissioning in 1975. The carrier was previously involved in Operation Eagle Claw, the failed 1980 mission to rescue American hostages in Tehran.</p><p>The crashes also coincided with President Donald Trump’s visit to Asia.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>If 2026 is your year to finally take that dream trip, the travel pros at Expedia say they already know where you’ll want to go.</p><p>Their new trend report breaks down destinations gaining the most buzz – and a few American getaways cracked the list of international gems.</p><p>The findings are based on millions of flight and hotel searches, comparing what travelers are eyeing now versus last year. </p><p>The biggest takeaway? Travelers are spreading out, trading overdone tourist hot spots for fresh destinations that offer space, culture and style.</p><p>Big Sky, Montana, took the top spot with a massive surge in interest. It’s easy to see why: wide-open views, world-class skiing and luxury resorts tucked into rugged scenery make it an easy pick for travelers who want the beauty of the West without the crowds.</p><p>Across the Pacific, Okinawa, Japan, is booming as more travelers look beyond Tokyo and Kyoto. With its laid-back island feel, it’s becoming a new favorite for visitors who want both adventure and relaxation.</p><p>Sardinia, Italy, continues to climb the list for 2026. The Mediterranean island blends crystal-clear coves and chic beach towns while promising fewer tourists than neighboring destinations like Amalfi or Capri.</p><p>In Vietnam, Phu Quoc is quickly becoming Asia’s next big island destination. Once known mostly to locals, it’s now catching international attention for its modern resorts and jungle-backed coastlines.</p><p>Back in Europe, Savoie, France, is also seeing a bump in travel interest, drawing visitors to its alpine villages, ski towns and year-round mountain escapes.</p><p>And for those who’d rather stay stateside, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, is emerging as a top pick for its convenience and laid-back beaches, all without the sticker shock or crowds of some bigger-name resorts.</p><p>Expedia’s data also suggests travelers in 2026 are going for variety, manifesting in ways like mix-and-match itineraries, off-peak trips, and unique destinations. That means everything from fly-fishing in Montana to snorkeling off Japan’s southern coast could be on the table next year.</p><p>2026 is shaping up to be a year for bold choices and new favorites.

The second sack he got on Patriots quarterback Drake Maye set a new bar for pass rushers under 30 years old. He hit 108.5 sacks with the mark and surpassed Reggie White for the record, according to Cleveland.com.</p><p>Garrett’s 2025 has been tumultuous at best.</p><p>He requested a trade back in February following the team’s poor 2024 season.</p><p>"As a kid dreaming of the NFL, all I focused on was the ultimate goal of winning a Super Bowl – and that goal fuels me today more than ever," he said in a statement.

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau just took a major step in their relationship. </p><p>On Oct. 25, the pair made their first public appearance while walking out of the Crazy Horse Paris. According to TMZ, the couple attended a cabaret show at the Parisian hot spot in celebration of the pop star's 41st birthday. </p><p>In photos obtained by Fox News Digital, Perry and Trudeau were all smiles as they walked hand-in-hand. At one point, Perry lovingly glanced at Trudeau. </p><p>The duo were first spotted dining together in July at Le Violon in Montréal, per footage obtained by TMZ.</p><p>At the time, a source told The Sun that the politician "has been single for a while and has enjoyed getting to know her."</p><p>"He likes her personality, and they are two people who really enjoy chatting about different topics, and they click very well so far, as they are going to see each other again very soon."</p><p>"He is feeling that talking to her and getting to know her is very refreshing, like a breath of fresh air in his life," the source continued. "He was happy to connect with her so well, and that she appreciates him being a normal, respectful person who was very understanding of her recent separation from Orlando Bloom."</p><p>During her concert at London's O2 arena earlier this month, Perry appeared to break her silence on her new romance with Trudeau while making a cheeky reference to ex Orlando Bloom, a U.K. native. </p><p>"London, England, you’re like this on a Monday night after a whole day at work and a whole day at school?" Perry told the crowd, according to the Sun. </p><p>"No wonder I fall for Englishmen all the time… but not anymore," she quipped, per the outlet.</p><p>In a video obtained by the Sun, Perry was seen laughingly rejecting a surprise marriage proposal from a fan.</p><p>"I wish you’d asked me 48 hours ago," the hitmaker joked. </p><p>Earlier this month, the couple was spotted sharing some PDA while aboard Perry's yacht, the Caravelle, off the coast of Santa Barbara.</p><p>In one frame, the former Canadian prime minister is seen kissing the "Dark Horse" crooner's cheek while pulling her in close for a hug. In another frame, Perry – who was wearing a dark-colored swimsuit – cozied up to Trudeau as he placed his hand on her bottom. </p><p>In August, a source told People that while they are "interested" in one another, developing a serious relationship might take some time given their respective histories.</p><p>Perry and Bloom confirmed their breakup in July after more than a decade together, while Trudeau separated from his wife of 18 years, Sophie Grégoire, in 2023.</p><p>"They are interested in each other, but it will take a while to see where this goes," the source said. "She is traveling around the world, and he is figuring out his life now that he is no longer prime minister of Canada, but there is an attraction. They have a lot in common."</p><p>"Their own personal responsibilities could make this relationship move slower than it would, but there are ways to see the other and still fulfill their parenting responsibilities. For one thing, they each have an ex. So, duties are split in half. And long-distance relationships, while still hard, are possible for these two."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said she doesn't regret "anything" while serving in the Biden administration when pressed on MSNBC Saturday.</p><p>Jean-Pierre appeared on MSNBC's "The Weekend: Primetime" to continue her recent media tour promoting her new book, "Independent." Near the end of the segment, co-host Ayman Mohyeldin asked her if there was anything Jean-Pierre regretted saying on behalf of former President Joe Biden.</p><p>After she briefly hesitated to reply, Mohyeldin jumped in saying, "It’s just a simple yes or no."</p><p>"No, no, no, no, because you’re asking for a yes or no question," Jean-Pierre insisted. "I want to put some context to it too. I woke up every day, very proud to be the White House press secretary. I woke up every day as a Black woman who is queer, who no one had ever seen someone like me at that podium standing behind that lectern. It was an honor and a privilege to have that job, and I did it to the best of my abilities. And I spoke for the President of the United States, a person that I believe was a decent person."</p><p>She continued, "We did not get everything right. No one is saying we got everything right. No one is saying that. But we did it to the best of our abilities. And I worked very hard to do that job. And so I want to put it into context. And, as you know, at the podium, you don’t do yes or no answers."</p><p>"We were hoping you would now that you are speaking for yourself, and you’re not at the podium," Mohyeldin said.</p><p>"Look, I was very proud of everything that I did. So I don’t take anything back. I was really proud of everything that I did. Again, we didn’t get everything right," Jean-Pierre responded.</p><p>Earlier in the interview, she defended her comments on the administration's policies, even when they were proven wrong or controversial.</p><p>"I appreciate the question, because one thing that I really want to make clear is that I was speaking on behalf of the president," Jean-Pierre said. "That is the job of the White House press secretary. I’m not speaking for Karine Jean-Pierre. I was speaking for Joe Biden. That’s every White House press secretary. That is their job."</p><p>This included her comments criticizing Special Counsel Robert Hur after his report suggested Biden had memory issues.</p><p>"What I’m saying is my reality was this: My reality was somebody that I saw every single day, who was sharp, who pushed, his team, was understanding, very clearly, of the policy of history. That is what I saw," Jean-Pierre said.</p><p>As she promotes her book, Jean-Pierre has repeatedly been asked about her past support for Biden's ability to do the job despite after he was forced off the Democratic ticket in 2024 due to his disastourous debate performance. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The New York Jets’ Sunday began with a horrible loss, as legendary center Nick Mangold passed away after a long battle with kidney disease. </p><p>But his old squad honored him in the biggest way with a miraculous comeback victory for their first win of the season in a 39-38 thriller over the Cincinnati Bengals.</p><p>Justin Fields and the Jets’ offense scored 23 fourth-quarter points to stun Joe Flacco and the Bengals, as they moved to 1-7 on the season. Meanwhile, Cincinnati’s momentum was stalled after a big win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. They are now 3-5 on the season. </p><p>The fourth quarter began with a Bengals’ 31-16 lead, as Flacco picked up where he left off from that Steelers game and continued to get the Bengals in position to score touchdowns. But Fields, who came into this game with tons of scrutiny for his play this season, kept moving the ball and staying in the game. </p><p>So, the quarter saw running back Breece Hall, who had 133 yards on 18 carries and two touchdowns, burst out for 35 yards to set up in the red zone. A few plays later he got into the end zone, and instead of going for the extra point, the Jets went for two points with Fields breaking the plain. </p><p>With the game at 31-24 in favor of Cincinnati, the Bengals’ run game responded with Chase Brown and Samaje Perine leading the way on the ensuing drive that ended with the former scoring his second touchdown of the game. </p><p>But, once again, the Jets came right back, as Hall’s second touchdown of the quarter was a 27-yard run where he avoided multiple tacklers, stayed in bounds and found the colored paint. The Jets went for two for the second straight drive, and this was the crucial one as Isaiah Davis caught the pass and just broke the goal line upon review to make it 36-32. </p><p>Still, the Jets’ defense needed to come up with a stop because Flacco continued to dissect them to that point. Mission accomplished, as Will McDonald IV secured the Jets’ first sack of the game on third-and-10, forcing a punt. </p><p>The Jets took advantage, going nine plays where Hall threw a touchdown to tight end Mason Taylor to take the lead following the extra point. </p><p>While the Jets celebrated, they knew the Bengals had all three of their timeouts and enough time on the clock to get into field goal range for Evan McPherson to attempt a potential game-winner. But Flacco was unable to find Andre Iosivas twice on third- and fourth-and-9 to turn the ball over on downs and give the Jets their first victory formation of the year. </p><p>Looking at the box score, Fields went 21-of-32 for 244 yards with one touchdown pass and 31 rushing yards. His touchdown pass was to Tyler Johnson, who had three catches for 64 yards, near the end of the first half. </p><p>For Flacco, he went 21-for-34 for 223 yards with two touchdowns with Ja’Marr Chase once again shining with 12 receptions for 91 yards. Tee Higgins had just one catch for Cincinnati, but it was a 41-yard touchdown for the Bengals.  </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i>  </p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>In a first for New Jersey politics, Orthodox Jewish leaders across Ocean County have united behind Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli, forming one of the state’s most influential faith-based voting coalitions, according to a report.</p><p>The Lakewood Scoop reported that the endorsement — announced jointly by councils representing Lakewood, Jackson, Toms River, Howell, and Manchester — marks an unprecedented show of unity from a community that has become a decisive force in New Jersey politics.</p><p>The Vaad — Lakewood’s longtime community council — worked closely with counterparts in nearby towns to align this year’s endorsements.</p><p>Leaders told The Lakewood Scoop the effort reflects a deliberate move toward broader collaboration across municipal lines, stressing that this election season is about unity, turnout and shared priorities.</p><p>"While the process took a little longer than usual, this time it was for a meaningful reason – for the first time, we worked to ensure that all towns are united and on the same page," organizers told the outlet. "The focus has been on Achdus – unity and collaboration – so that every community’s voice is represented in one strong collective statement."</p><p>"Every single vote in every single town is critical in this election," they added. "Each area has its own local races and priorities, but together we share a larger responsibility – turning out every possible vote. This election will be decided by turnout. Let’s make sure our communities are heard loud and clear at the ballot box."</p><p>The Lakewood Scoop also obtained letters from local communities underscoring that unity, including one sent to residents in Howell urging every eligible voter to take part in the election.</p><p>"Our voice is only as strong as the number of people who actually vote," the letter reads.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto watched a popout to third baseman Max Muncy end yet another incredible pitching performance, this time to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers over the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 2 of the World Series. </p><p>Yamamoto completed his second straight postseason complete game, and he joined some rare MLB company in doing so. </p><p>Yamamoto, who led the way for Los Angeles in the 5-1 victory to even the "Fall Classic" at one game apiece, gave up just four hits and one earned run while striking out eight Blue Jays hitters. </p><p>"Outstanding, uber competitive, special," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said of his star pitcher. "Yeah, he was just locked in tonight."</p><p>The much-needed pitching performance for the Dodgers led Yamamoto to become the first pitcher since Curt Schilling to pitch consecutive complete games in the postseason. </p><p>Schilling, who pitched for the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks, did it three straight times as he was money in Games 1 and 5 of the NLDS as well as Game 3 of the NLCS. </p><p>The last postseason complete game before Yamamoto’s on Sunday was Justin Verlander, who did so with the Houston Astros during their controversial World Series-winning 2017 season.</p><p>The start wasn’t necessarily the best for Yamamoto, as the leadoff hitter got on base for the Blue Jays in each of the first three innings. In fact, George Springer and Nathan Lukes made it runners on first and third with no outs in the bottom of the first inning. </p><p>But Yamamoto got out of that jam and others, with his only blemish a sacrifice fly given up to Alejandro Kirk through his nine innings of work. The fastball-splitter combo was working well for him again, while his 74 mph curveball was fooling hitters all night as well. </p><p>With Yamamoto setting the tone on the mound for Los Angeles, Kevin Gausman was doing the same for the Blue Jays. But that was until the top of the seventh inning when Will Smith and Muncy went yard to make it a 3-1 game. </p><p>The Dodgers would add two more runs to give Yamamoto a cushion, but even with the two-run lead, he appeared so locked in that those runs never mattered in the end. </p><p>"He was just that good," Blue Jays manager John Schneider said, per Sports Illustrated. "He made it hard for us to make him work. He was in the zone, split was in and out of the zone.

<div class="article-title">Hurricane Melissa is a powerful Category 4 storm in the Caribbean</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Melissa strengthened rapidly into a Category 4 hurricane on Sunday and was forecast to bring "life-threatening and catastrophic" <span class="link">flash flooding and landslides</span> to Jamaica and the southern parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic over the next few days, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center warned.</p><p>Hurricane Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major <span class="link">impacts on the mainland United States</span>, but could turn out to be the strongest system this season.</p><h2>Melissa's forecast and path</h2><p>As of 2 a.m. EDT Monday, Melissa's core was about 130 miles south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 315 miles south-southwest of Guantanamo, Cuba, the hurricane center said. Maximum sustained winds had strengthened to 150 mph, with hurricane-force winds extending some 30 miles from the storm's center and tropical storm-force winds extending 195 miles. It was crawling west at 5 mph.</p>
<p>Melissa is now considered a major hurricane, which is defined as a <span class="link">Category 3 or higher</span> with winds of at least 111 mph. If its winds reach 157 mph it would be a Category 5 -- the strongest there is. Melissa is forecast to remain a major hurricane when it makes landfall in Jamaica later this week, the hurricane center said. </p><p>"On the forecast track," the center said, "the core of Melissa is expected to move near or over Jamaica tonight and Tuesday, across southeastern Cuba Tuesday night, and across the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday. </p><p>"Additional intensification is forecast today, followed by fluctuations in intensity before Melissa reaches Jamaica.  Melissa is expected to be a powerful major hurricane when making landfall in Jamaica and southeastern Cuba."</p>
<p>When Melissa makes landfall, peak storm surge accompanied by destructive waves could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level, according to the NHC.</p>
<p>Melissa could be the most powerful hurricane to hit Jamaica, CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak said Saturday.</p><p>"The island's terrain makes it even worse," Kozak said. "Jamaica's mountains force the air to rise, and that creates more rain."   </p><p>The strongest hurricane to hit Jamaica was Gilbert in 1988, Kozak said, which killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.</p>
<h2>Hurricane advisories</h2><p>A hurricane warning is in effect for Jamaica and the Cuban provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. A tropical storm warning is posted for Haiti and the Cuban province of Las Tunas.</p>
<p>The Naval Station Guantanamo Bay said it was moving "non-mission-essential" U.S. citizens off the island in groups ahead of severe weather from Melissa.</p>
<h2>Rainfall forecasts</h2><p>Melissa is expected to bring 15 to 30 inches of rain to areas of Jamaica and 8 to 16 inches for southern Hispaniola through Wednesday, with a total of 40 inches possible in some places, the hurricane center said. For eastern Cuba, total rainfall could reach 10 to 15 inches, with as much as 20 inches in some spots today into Wednesday, the center added..</p><p>"Catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are probable across portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica," forecasters said. Hispaniola is an island that includes Haiti and the Dominican Republic. </p><p>Additional heavy rainfall is likely beyond Tuesday, the hurricane center said, but uncertainty remains about the more extended forecast.</p>

<div class="article-title">1 dead, 6 injured in shooting at Lincoln University homecoming event</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A man is dead and six others were injured in a shooting during a homecoming celebration at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, Saturday night, the Chester County district attorney announced.</p><p>District Attorney Christopher de Barrena-Sarobe said one person who had a gun has since been detained.  </p><p>Jujuan Jeffers, of Wilmington, Delaware, died in the shooting, de Barrena-Sarobe said during a press conference on Sunday.</p><p>One current Lincoln student is among the wounded, as is one graduate of the school. The other people who were hurt are not directly connected to the university, the DA said. All of the victims are 20 to 25 years old and are expected to survive.</p><p>The shooting happened in the parking lot of the International Cultural Center (ICC) building just before 9:30 p.m., where a post-football game celebratory tailgate and Yardfest event was being held, Lincoln University police chief Marc Partee said during a press conference early Sunday morning.</p>
<p>"This was to be a joyous occasion," Partee said. "Homecoming — when individuals come back, and they give back to their alma mater, and they live the good memories of their time at Lincoln University, which has helped them propel into life. This was interrupted by gunfire that should not have occurred."</p><p>At this time, it's still unclear what led up to the shooting and why shots were fired. The school was placed on lockdown, but that was later lifted.</p><p>"Today, we're operating as if this is not an incident where someone came in with the design to inflict mass damage on a college campus," de Barrena-Sarobe said during the news conference.</p><p>Investigators believe there were multiple shooters, but there is no clear threat to the campus at this time, de Barrena-Sarobe said.</p>
<p>In a statement posted Sunday afternoon on social media, Lincoln University President Brenda A. Allen's office said the school is cooperating with authorities.</p><p>"As this remains an ongoing investigation, details may evolve over the next several days," the post says. "We will continue to keep the Lincoln University community informed of any major updates as they become available."</p><p>Classes are canceled Monday "for a day of healing and reflection," but the school will remain open with staff on campus to support students, the statement says. The president's office also invited the campus community to gather at noon Monday in the Historic District for a moment of connection and healing. </p><p>Counseling services will be available all week for students, faculty and staff, the post says. </p><p>Lincoln University is on Baltimore Pike in southern Chester County, about 45 miles from Philadelphia.</p><h2>1 arrested in connection with Lincoln University shooting</h2><p>Zecqueous Morgan-Thompson, of Wilmington, Delaware, was arrested for carrying a concealed firearm without a license and is being held at Chester County Prison on $25,000 cash bail, de Barrena-Sarobe said, adding that he could not confirm whether the gun he had was used in the shooting.</p><p>As of 5 p.m. Sunday, the scene remained active, de Barrena-Sarobe said, and investigators are conducting a grid search of the area and working with K9s to gather evidence. They are also interviewing people and reviewing video evidence, he said.</p>
<p>"Stitching together videos is going to be a key part of this investigation," de Barrena-Sarobe said.</p><h2>"Devastating" night in southern Chester County, DA says</h2><p>Law enforcement described a chaotic scene where people fled in every direction after shots were fired. People were seen running for cover, and several others were being treated after they were knocked to the ground and trampled, officials said.</p><p>CBS News Philadelphia spoke to a witness who said he saw one person receiving CPR.</p><p>Tents were set up in the ICC parking lot for the tailgating event, designed for people to come together, reconnect and celebrate Lincoln University. De Barrena-Sarobe said the ICC is also where the Lincoln University Police Department is housed.</p><p>"This mass shooting should never have happened. Never have happened," the district attorney said.</p><p>"We are concerned for our students who had to experience this, our alumni who had to experience this, and our visitors and friends," Partee said. "We set this out to be a time to celebrate the legacy of Lincoln University, the first historically Black, HBCU in the country. So, devastated, if there was another word to describe that, that's more impactful, I would use it, but devastated is a start."</p><p>The Chester County DA said officials are continuing to monitor all the victims and are investigating the shooting with the full power of federal, state and local law enforcement. </p>
<p>Following the shooting, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said on X, "I've been briefed on the shooting at Lincoln University tonight, and my Administration has offered our full support to President Allen and local law enforcement.  Please avoid the area, continue to follow the guidance of local law enforcement, and join Lori and me in praying for the Lincoln University community."</p><h2>Lincoln community processes a tragedy</h2><p>People who were on campus said the tragedy has been difficult to process. </p><p>"The last thing you think about is something as tragic as this occurring when you're just here for a good time and having fun," said Joslyn Royster, who graduated from Lincoln in 2015.</p><p>When the shooting happened, a nearby bowling alley went into lockdown and soon became a staging area for first responders. Workers said they stayed until 2 a.m. to offer coffee, food and a place to warm up. </p><p>"It was hard to sleep that night, I always see it in the movies or on screen, but seeing it happen right in front of my eyes definitely puts a whole different perspective on things," said Rocco Saienni, a shift supervisor at Timber Wolfe Lanes. </p><h2>A plea for tips</h2><p>De Barrena-Sarobe urged anyone with any information about the shooting to call 1-800-CALL-FBI (225-5324) or share it online. Digital evidence will be key in this investigation so law enforcement can hold the shooter or shooters accountable, officials said.</p><p>"Because we are going to not stop until we are able to arrest and to find the person or people that shot all of these people at Lincoln University," he said.</p>
<p>The Chester County detectives are leading the investigation. The FBI is assisting.</p>

<div class="article-title">Hurricane Melissa threatens to bring catastrophic flooding to Jamaica</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><span class="link">Hurricane Melissa</span> strengthened into a major Category 4 hurricane on Sunday, unleashing torrential rain and threatening to bring flash flooding and landslides to the northern Caribbean, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.</p><p>The center said those impacts could be "life-threatening and catastrophic" for parts of Haiti and Jamaica, especially as Melissa was potentially forecast to intensify further into a Category 5 storm.</p><p>The weather agency added that Melissa is likely to reach the southern coast of Jamaica as a major hurricane late Monday or Tuesday morning, and urged people on the island to seek shelter immediately.</p><p>"Conditions (in Jamaica) are going to go down rapidly today," Jamie Rhome, the center's deputy director, said on Sunday. "Be ready to ride this out for several days."</p><p>Melissa could be the most powerful hurricane to hit Jamaica, CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak said Saturday.</p>
<p>"I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously," said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. "Take all measures to protect yourself."</p>
<p>Melissa was expected to drop torrential rains of up to 30 inches on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola — Haiti and the Dominican Republic — according to the hurricane center. Some areas may see as much as 40 inches of rain.</p><p>The hurricane center said life-threatening storm surge was "likely" along Jamaica's southern coast late Monday through Tuesday morning. Storm surge could reach 9 to 13 feet east of where Melissa makes landfall, and will be "accompanied by large and destructive waves," the hurricane center said.</p><p>It also warned that extensive damage to infrastructure, power and communication outages, and the isolation of communities in Jamaica were to be expected.</p>
<p>Melissa should be near or over Cuba by late Tuesday, where it could bring up to 12 inches of rain, before moving toward the Bahamas later Wednesday. </p><p>The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.</p><h2>Preparations underway</h2><p>The erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.</p><p>"Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire," Jamie Rhome, the hurricane center's deputy director, said earlier on Saturday. He said the storm will continue to move slowly for up to four days.</p><p>Jamaica's government said the main airport in Montego Bay, Sangster International Airport, will shut down at midday local time on Sunday as the island's national emergency agency activated its level 3 emergency protocol ahead of Melissa.</p>
<p>The biggest airport on the island, Norman Manley International Airport in the capital, Kingston, closed at 9 p.m. on Saturday.</p><p>"With the slow movement of this system, it doesn't allow you to recover. It's going to sit there, pouring water while it's barely moving and that is a significant challenge that we have to be aware of," warned Evan Thompson, principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica.</p>
<p>"There is nowhere that will escape the wrath of this hurricane," Richard Thompson, acting director general of the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, said.</p><p>He said all members of the National Response Team are now on full alert.</p><p>More than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages were pre-positioned for quick distribution if needed.</p><h2>Damaged homes, rising water</h2><p>Haitian authorities said three people had died as a consequence of the hurricane and another five were injured due to a collapsed wall. There were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.</p><p>"The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it's moving," said Ronald Délice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organized lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes. </p><p>The storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters.</p>
<p>The Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.</p>
<p>Melissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.</p><p>The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted an above-normal season with 13 to 18 named storms.</p>

<div class="article-title">Federal food aid will not go out starting Nov. 1, USDA website alert says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has posted a notice on its website saying federal food aid will not go out on Nov. 1, raising the stakes for families nationwide as the government shutdown drags on.</p><p>The new notice comes after the Trump administration said it would not tap roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as SNAP, flowing into November. That program helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries.</p><p>"Bottom line, the well has run dry," the USDA notice says. "At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats."</p><p>The shutdown, which began on Oct. 1, is now the second-longest on record. While the Republican administration took steps leading up to the shutdown to ensure SNAP benefits were paid this month, the cutoff would expand the impact of the impasse to a wider swath of Americans — and some of those most in need — unless a political resolution is found in just a few days.</p><p>The administration blames Democrats, who say they will not agree to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate with them on extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say Democrats must first agree to reopen the government before negotiations.</p>
<p>"There is an urgent need to reopen the government, which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature," <span class="link">House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said</span> on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" on Sunday. </p><p>Democratic lawmakers have written to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins requesting that she use contingency funds to cover the bulk of next month's benefits. </p><p>But a USDA memo that surfaced Friday says "contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits." The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.</p><p>The memo cited Hurricane Melissa, which has <span class="link">strengthened into a major hurricane</span>, as an example of why it's important to have the money available to mobilize quickly in the event of a disaster.</p>
<p>The prospect of families not receiving food aid has deeply concerned states run by both parties.</p><p><span class="link">Some states have pledged to keep SNAP </span>benefits flowing even if the federal program halts payments, but there are questions about whether U.S. government directives may allow that to happen. The USDA memo also says states would not be reimbursed for temporarily picking up the cost.</p><p>Other states are telling SNAP recipients to be ready for the benefits to stop. Arkansas and Oklahoma, for example, are advising recipients to identify food pantries and other groups that help with food.</p><p>Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut accused Republicans and President Trump of not agreeing to negotiate.</p><p>"The reality is, if they sat down to try to negotiate, we could probably come up with something pretty quickly," Murphy said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." "We could open up the government on Tuesday or Wednesday, and there wouldn't be any crisis in the food stamp program."</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump headed for Asia for the first time this term, a trip on which he's expected to work on investment deals and peace efforts before meeting face-to-face with Chinese President<span class="link"> Xi Jinping</span> to try to de-escalate a <span class="link">trade war</span>.</p><p>"We have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us," Mr. Trump told reporters Friday night as he left the White House. "I think we'll have a good meeting."</p><p>A Treasury spokesperson said that US-China trade talks reconvened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, at around 9:15 a.m. local time on Sunday morning.</p><p>The president had a long-haul flight where he arrived in Malaysia on Sunday morning, the first stop of a three-country visit.</p><p>Aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Mr. Trump told reporters he may be discussing its <span class="link">purchases of Russian oil</span> with Xi. He said China is substantially cutting back on its future purchases after the U.S. imposed sanctions on Moscow's two biggest oil companies. Chinese national oil companies will, at least in the short term, refrain from buying Russian oil, Reuters reported last week.</p>
<p>When asked when he hopes to accomplish from the meeting with China, the president said, "I think a complete deal."</p><p>"I want our farmers to be taken care of, and he wants things also. We're going to be talking about fentanyl," Mr. Trump said Saturday. "I think we have a really good chance of making a very comprehensive deal."</p><p>During a refueling stop in Qatar, Mr. Trump met with the country's emir and prime minister Saturday aboard Air Force One. The Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, said that as soon as he heard the president was coming to Qatar, he wanted to have a conversation.</p><p>Mr. Trump thanked the emir and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani for bringing "peace to the Middle East," after they served as intermediaries during the <span class="link">Israel-Hamas peace deal</span>, calling them a "great ally."</p>
<p>His trip comes as the <span class="link">U.S. government shutdown</span> drags on. Many federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, there are flight disruptions as already-squeezed air traffic controllers work without pay, and states are confronting the possibility that federal food aid could dry up. As Republicans reject Democratic demands to extend health care tax credits, there's no sign of a break in the impasse. But Mr.Trump himself appears to be maintaining a business-as-usual approach, including by embarking on this latest foreign trip.</p><p>"America is shut down and the President is skipping town," Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said.</p><p>Mr. Trump's first stop is at a regional summit in Kuala Lumpur. Trump attended the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit only once during his first term, but this year it comes as Malaysia and the U.S. have been working to address a skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia.</p><p>On Sunday, he's scheduled to have a meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, followed by a joint signing ceremony with the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia.</p><p>"I am on my way to Malaysia, where I will sign the great Peace Deal, which I proudly brokered between Cambodia and Thailand," Mr. Trump said Saturday in a Truth Social post. He also sent condolences to the people of Thailand following the death of Queen Mother Sirikit. </p><p>"I will be seeing their wonderful Prime Minister when we land. In order to accommodate everyone for this major event, we will be signing the Peace Deal immediately upon arrival," he said.</p><p>Mr. Trump threatened earlier this year to withhold trade deals with the countries if they didn't stop fighting, and his administration has since been working with Malaysia to nail down an expanded ceasefire.</p>
<p>From there, Mr. Trump heads to Japan and South Korea, where he's expected to make progress on talks for at least $900 billion in investments for U.S. factories and other projects that those countries committed to in return for easing Trump's planned <span class="link">tariff rates</span> down to 15% from 25%.</p><p>The trip to Tokyo comes a week after Japan elected its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. Trump is set to meet with Takaichi, who is a protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Mr. Trump was close to Abe, who was assassinated after leaving office.</p><p>Mr. Trump said Takaichi's relationship with Abe was "a good sign" and "I look forward to meeting her."</p><p>While there, Mr. Trump is expected to be hosted by Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and meet with <span class="link">U.S. troops who are stationed</span> in Japan, according to a senior U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity about the planned trip.</p><p>In South Korea, Mr. Trump is expected to hold a <span class="link">highly anticipated meeting</span> with China's Xi on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.</p><p>While the APEC summit is set to be held in Gyeongju, the Trump-Xi meeting is expected to take place in the city of Busan, according to the U.S. official.</p><p>The meeting follows months of volatile moves in a <span class="link">trade war</span> between China and the U.S. that have rattled the global economy.</p>

<div class="article-title">Arrests made in crown jewelry heist at Paris' Louvre museum, prosecutor says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Two people were arrested in connection with the <span class="link">theft of crown jewels</span> from Paris' Louvre museum, a Paris prosecutor said on Sunday, a week after the <span class="link">brazen heist</span> at the world's most visited museum.</p><p>The prosecutor said investigators made the arrests Saturday evening, adding that one of the men taken into custody was preparing to leave the country from Paris' Roissy Airport.</p><p>French media BFM TV and Le Parisien newspaper earlier reported that two suspects had been arrested and taken into custody. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau did not confirm the number of arrests and did not say whether jewels had been recovered.</p><p>A police official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing case, told The Associated Press that two men in their 30s, both known to police, were taken into custody. He said one suspect was arrested as he attempted to board a plane bound for Algeria. The official added that one of the suspects was identified through DNA traces. Beccuau said earlier this week that forensics experts were analyzing 150 samples at the scene.</p><p>The suspects can be held in police custody up to 96 hours.</p>
<p>Thieves took less than <span class="link">eight minutes to steal jewels</span> valued at <span class="link">$102 million</span> last Sunday morning.</p><p>Questions have arisen about security at the museum and whether security cameras might have failed as the thieves rode a basket lift up the Louvre's facade, cut their way through a window, smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels. The museum's director called the incident a "terrible failure."</p>
<p>Beccuau said investigators from a special police unit in charge of armed robberies, serious burglaries and art thefts made the arrests. She rued in her statement the premature leak of information, saying it could hinder the work of over 100 investigators "mobilized to recover the stolen jewels and apprehend all of the perpetrators." Beccuau said further details will be unveiled after the suspects' custody period ends.</p><p>French Interior Minister Laurent Nunez praised "the investigators who have worked tirelessly, just as I asked them to, and who have always had my full confidence."</p>
<p>The theft focused on the gilded Apollo Gallery, where the Crown Diamonds are displayed. <span class="link">Eight objects</span> were taken, according to officials: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife; a reliquary brooch; and Empress Eugénie's diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch, a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.</p>
<p>One piece — Eugénie's emerald-set imperial crown with more than 1,300 diamonds — was later found outside the museum, damaged but recoverable.</p><p>The crown jewels are priceless in historical terms, but experts have told CBS News they would still be worth millions of dollars if broken up and sold on the black market.</p><p>The jewels <span class="link">were not privately insured</span>, the French Ministry of Culture stated in a press release to the daily newspaper Le Parisien. French law prohibits entities like the Louvre from insuring its property, except when part of a collection is moved or loaned to another institution, Romain Déchelette, president of France-based Serex Assurances, a fine art insurer, told CBS News.</p>

<div class="article-title">In Venezuela, citizens fear U.S. military intervention</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>This month, correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi and a 60 Minutes team walked into a central  market in Caracas, Venezuela, to speak to people after weeks of escalating tension between their country and the United States. It was a rare chance for American journalists to enter the oil-rich country.</p><p>They found a palpable sense of unease and uncertainty among Venezuelan citizens; some worried about a possible U.S. ground invasion or air strikes in their country. </p><p>"I have kids [and] grandkids, and my mother is still alive. I'm scared Venezuela is going to be bombed for no reason," a Caracas woman told 60 Minutes. </p><p>Since August, eight warships have been stationed just off the Venezuelan coast and over 10,000 American troops are in the region.</p><p>In September, the U.S. military began bombing boats that the Trump administration alleges were part of a drug smuggling operation led by Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro.</p>
<p>So far, the strikes have destroyed 10 boats and more than three dozen people. </p><p>"A lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea," President Trump told the media in a press conference. "But we're going to stop them by land also," he said, alluding to targeted strikes in Venezuela. </p><p>Many close observers believe the increased pressure on Venezuela has an unstated goal: forcing Maduro out of office.</p><p>A former top diplomat to Venezuela, Ambassador James Story, who served in President Trump's first term and under President Joe Biden, told 60 Minutes that the U.S. could oust him by force.</p>
<p>"The assets are there to do everything up to and including decapitation of [the] government," Story told Alfonsi in an interview. </p><p>"Now, has the decision been made? That I don't know. But it does look increasingly likely… some action may take place."</p><p>Alfonsi interviewed Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, who counts many Venezuelan immigrants among his constituents.</p><p>"Is this about anti-narcotics or is this about removing Maduro?" 60 Minutes asked the senator. </p><p>"I think it's primarily about narco[-trafficking], and all the drugs coming in," Scott told Alfonsi.</p><p>"I'm glad Trump's doing what he's doing. And I do hope Maduro's out of power. I mean, I want him gone."</p><p>After months of negotiations, and amidst escalating tensions with the Trump White House, Maduro agreed to do an interview with 60 Minutes.</p>
<p>Producer Michael Karzis was able to obtain a journalism visa through the Maduro government for himself, Alfonsi and a 60 Minutes crew.</p><p>"The Maduro government granted us a rare visa… with the intention and understanding that we were gonna do an interview with President Maduro," he told 60 Minutes Overtime.</p><p>After the team arrived in Caracas, they set up lights and cameras in the basement ballroom of a hotel, a location hand-picked by the Maduro government.</p><p>At the last minute, as the interview was expected to begin, the team received a phone call.</p><p>"The defense minister and President Maduro's chief intelligence officer called the interview off because of safety concerns," Karzis explained. </p><p>"So we reset," Alfonsi told 60 Minutes Overtime. "[We] said, 'OK, what are we gonna do? What can we go see? Let's go talk to people.'"</p><p>The next day, they headed to a busy market. </p>
<p>60 Minutes wanted to learn what Venezuelans thought of the American military presence just off the coast and whether Maduro could, or should, be removed from office.</p><p>"We'd ask people questions, and they'd kind of back off… they're nervous that somebody's listening from the regime," Alfonsi told 60 Minutes Overtime. </p><p>In the last presidential election, 70% of the vote went to the opposition. It wasn't even close. </p><p>But Maduro refused to leave, effectively stealing the presidency. Protests were met with brutal crackdowns, which the United Nations says included jailing, torturing and even killing opposition supporters.</p><p>Alfonsi asked one woman, a 20-year-old mother, what would happen if the Maduro regime was no longer in charge of the country.</p><p>"Venezuela would change and we would all be free," she told Alfonsi. </p><p>The young woman told 60 Minutes that she understands speaking out against the government is not "smart" but she wanted to do so anyway. </p>
<p>"I am not in favor of the government; I am against it. I wish this world would change, so I could have a better future," she said. </p><p>"Three days before the vote, they offer a bonus to vote the way the government wants." </p><p>Alfonsi asked a young man in his late 20s if he thought Maduro could be replaced.</p><p>"Well, if necessary," the young man said. "If they replace him with someone better, they should."</p><p>Every Venezuelan 60 Minutes spoke with objected to the Trump administration's accusation that Venezuela is running a drug manufacturing and trafficking operation with Maduro as its figurehead.</p><p>One man, who was wearing a hat with the insignia of a civilian-military organization, said the accusation didn't make sense given the country mainly exports oil.</p><p>"The country of Venezuela doesn't need to rely on drugs because we are a petroleum country. We have never cultivated a drug trade here," he told Alfonsi.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice has put a $50 million bounty for the arrest of Maduro, and more warships are now on their way into the Caribbean. </p><p>Karzis told 60 Minutes Overtime his sources see three potential outcomes for the embattled president.</p><p>"He packs his bags and leaves. Or he's [arrested]... or he can meet his maker," he said.</p><p>"It's not a question of if, but a question of when."</p><p><em>The video above was produced by Will Croxton.

<div class="article-title">What's next for Nicolás Maduro as Trump pressures Venezuela</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The U.S. bombing of alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean off the coast of Venezuela and the buildup of military assets in the region have raised broader questions about possible plans to oust President Nicolás Maduro.</p><p>The Venezuelan leader, first elected in 2013, has been in the United States' crosshairs for years. Ambassador James Story, who was the last American diplomat at the now-closed U.S. embassy in Venezuela, said the show of U.S. force in the region is likely intended to oust Maduro. </p><p>"This is a very bad actor sitting on top of the world's largest known reserves of oil, plus the critical minerals that will fuel the 21st-century economy, and he's in bed with our strategic competitors," Story said.</p><p>"Let's be very clear," Story added. "This is a criminal organization masquerading as a government. This is an individual who is under indictment for narcotics trafficking-- commits human rights violations. Someone who has used the apparatus of the state to throw people in jail, to torture them, to kill them."</p><h2>What life is like in Venezuela under dictator Nicolás Maduro</h2><p>Earlier this month, 60 Minutes traveled to the South American nation for a rare look at what life is like under its embattled dictator. Correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi found that instability isn't just an architectural feature in Venezuela, it's a way of life. </p>
<p>Hunger, chronic blackouts and scarcity of essential medicines plague the country of more than 28 million people. Today, more than 70% of the residents live in poverty. It's a stunning reversal of fortune for a nation that was once one of the wealthiest countries in the world. </p><p>Socialist policies and mismanagement have crippled Venezuela's economy.</p>
<p>The crisis has been exacerbated by U.S. sanctions imposed in direct response to the regime's anti-democratic actions, human rights violations and corruption. </p><p>Shoppers at a busy market in Caracas, Venezuela's capital, heatedly haggled over prices. The country is facing a triple-digit inflation rate.</p>
<p>One woman at the market said the $50 a week she earns is insufficient to feed her family. She said she plans to move to Spain in a few months. </p><p>Nearly 8 million Venezuelans — roughly 20% of the population — have fled the country in the last decade. Most of those who remained hoped last year's <span class="link">presidential elections</span> would be a turning point. But even after tallies showed the opposition won nearly 70% of the vote, Maduro refused to leave, stealing the presidency. Protests were met with brutal crackdowns, which the United Nations says included jailing, torture and even killing opposition. </p><h2>U.S.-Venezuela tensions rise, reach a boiling point</h2><p>In January, the Trump administration briefly engaged with Maduro's government. The U.S. negotiated a deal for the release of six U.S. prisoners who were arrested while visiting the country. The U.S. also negotiated for the resumption of <span class="link">flights carrying Venezuelans deported from the U.S. </span>back to their country. </p><p>Though tensions have been on the rise, Venezuela is still accepting planes full of U.S. deportees. Maduro frames their return as a triumph, repatriating Venezuelans from harsh conditions in U.S. detention. But most of the deportees 60 Minutes spoke with said they felt defeated.</p><p>In August, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi doubled an existing award for information leading to Maduro's arrest, bringing the total to <span class="link">$50 million</span>. U.S. officials accused the Venezuelan leader of being one of the world's largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine.</p>
<p>Maduro has repeatedly called U.S. accusations that he oversees a narco-state "disinformation." Most fentanyl is produced in Mexico or China and, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Venezuela is not a major producer of cocaine either, but it is a transit route for it. </p><p>In recent months, the U.S. has launched a series of strikes against vessels alleged to be carrying drugs, calling it a counter-narcotics mission. The U.S. military has blown up at least 10 vessels since September, killing more than three dozen alleged drug smugglers. Most of the vessels were targeted off the coast of Venezuela. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, President Trump announced he had <span class="link">approved covert CIA operations</span> inside Venezuela. And on Friday, the Trump administration escalated its military campaign, sending the world's largest aircraft carrier to the region.</p><p>F-35 fighter jets, eight U.S. warships and an estimated 10,000 U.S. troops are now in the Caribbean, with <span class="link">more on the way</span>.  </p><p>The weight of uncertainty and the rumble of armored vehicles can be felt throughout the country. An estimated 125,000 members of <span class="link">Venezuela's military</span> have mobilized. While 60 Minutes was there, the government held emergency drills and urged civilians to prepare for combat.</p><h2>What's next for Maduro </h2><p>With the $50 million reward on his head and U.S. military presence increasing in the region, 60 Minutes was stunned when, after months of negotiations, Maduro agreed to an interview. His ministers chose the time and place, the ballroom of a busy hotel in Caraces. It was called off minutes before the interview was finally set to begin. 60 Minutes was told the president's minister of defense and head of intelligence said it was no longer safe to do the interview. </p><p>Two days later, Maduro appeared at a rally for an Indigenous Peoples Day event in Caracas. He was surrounded by hundreds of people. Maduro urged the crowd to defend the republic. </p><p>Venezuela's leader has been defiant for months, despite the bounty on his head. He's openly challenged the U.S. and its accusations against him in front of crowds of supporters. </p><p>But privately, he's been making concessions. Last week, Mr. Trump confirmed Maduro offered the U.S. a stake in the country's oil to avoid conflict, saying that<span class="link"> Maduro didn't "want to f*** around with the United States</span>."</p>
<p>While in Caracas, 60 Minutes also met with Phil Gunson, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, a non-governmental organization committed to preventing and resolving deadly conflict. Gunson, who's lived in the South American country for nearly 30 years, is a rarity in Venezuela: an expert willing to speak openly about the government and Maduro's odds of surviving the current crisis.</p><p>"The asking price is Maduro's head. I mean, he has to go," Gunson said.</p>
<p>Maduro has used public events and the large crowds at them as a defense, Gunson said. </p><p>"Once or twice lately, he's done something quite unusual, which is to hold his events in hotels," Gunson said. "The U.S. isn't gonna kill him in a hotel, obviously."</p><p>Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott said the U.S. is right to try and remove Maduro.</p><p>"If I was Maduro, I'd head to Russia or China right now," he said.</p><p>The Republican senator feels confident that change is coming.</p>
<p>"His days are numbered," Scott said. "Something's gonna happen. Whether it's internal or external, I think something's gonna happen."</p><h2>Are there hopes for a peaceful transition of power in Venezuela?</h2><p>Gunson says even if Maduro steps aside, the transition to a democracy would be bumpy at best. <span class="link">María Corina Machado</span>, the opposition leader who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, has been in hiding for months but has said she has a plan. Gunson said there's no guarantee a transition would be peaceful.</p><p>"One of the things that worries me most is that there's been no apparent negotiation with a key element in all of this story, which is the Venezuelan armed forces," Gunson said. "If the Venezuelan armed forces don't go along with this, and by the armed forces I really mean the high command, the people who give the orders, then there's a possibility perhaps the armed forces might split, there's a possibility they might oppose a new government coming in."</p><p>He says well-armed Colombian guerrilla groups that Maduro allows to operate in Venezuela might also resist a change in power. Gunson said he believes that the U.S. will ultimately need to put boots on the ground to keep order.</p><p>"I mean, if the U.S. is responsible. It's kind of the Pottery Barn principle, isn't it? If you break it, you own it," Gunson said. "You have to protect the government that you just put in power. And that means I think thousands of troops."</p><p>In Washington, lawmakers are debating the legality of the U.S. military action. Some say the strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.  </p><p>The Trump administration insists they are lawful and self-defense. </p>
<p>On Thursday, Maduro appealed for peace.</p><p>"Not war. Not war. Not war. Just peace, just peace. Just peace," he said.</p><p>Alfonsi asked Gunson what would happen if the Trump administration turned its warships around from Venezuela. </p><p>"It would be an enormous political triumph for Maduro," Gunson said. "He'd be able to say forever afterwards, you know, 'I stood up to the U.S., I stood up to the empire, as they call it,and the empire retreated.'"</p>

<div class="article-title">Meet the doctor helping people train for a longer, healthier life</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Dr. Peter Attia spends a lot of time thinking about the last years of his life – and yours too. He's declared war on what he calls the marginal decade, the final years of life that are plagued by sickness and immobility. It's not often that 60 Minutes does a story on a physician who has fewer than 75 patients, but the Stanford-trained Attia has become both a pioneer and a star in the growing field of longevity medicine. His stark diagnosis – and advice on what to do about it – have attracted millions of followers, and billionaire patients who pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to hear the words "Dr. Attia will see you now."</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: At 75, both men and women fall off a cliff.</p><p>Norah O'Donnell: At 75?</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: At the population level, it's unmistakable what happens at the age of 75. That's what we're up against. That's what I'm thinking about in the practice is, how do I create an escape velocity that gets somebody another 15 years there? </p><p>Norah O'Donnell: And so is your goal to minimize or essentially erase that marginal decade?</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Attia: The marginal decade's not going anywhere. We will all have a final decade of life. My goal is to make the marginal decade as enjoyable as possible. The way I explain it to my patients is, that last 10-15 of your years, if you don't do anything about it, you will fall to a level of about 50% of your total capacity, cognitively, physically. </p><p>Norah O'Donnell: And when people hear that you're like, "I don't wanna be that. That's not how I want to spend the last decade of my life."</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: That's right. A lot of people respond that way as though they're hearing this for the first time. Although if you ask them, "Haven't you seen people in this state?" They'll say, "Well, yeah, I guess I have."</p><p>Norah O'Donnell: Right. Likely their own relatives.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Attia: Sure. Their own parents even.</p><p>Norah O'Donnell: So do you consider yourself a new kind of doctor?</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: No, I don't think so. What we're doing is creating a framework that fits directly into this idea of how to train for the marginal decade. </p>
<p>That training begins here in Austin, Texas, where Attia is based. This is where his patients go through two days of physical evaluation, and where we found, after just a few hours, how intense the 52-year-old doctor and his methods are.</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: I think this is the neglected part of medical testing, is how fit are you, how strong are you, how well do you move? And in many ways, these tests are even more predictive of how long you're going to live than what I might get out of your bloodwork.</p><p>Norah O'Donnell: How do we know that?</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: The data are pretty clear. When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure. </p>
<p>Dr. Attia and his team say the key indicator of overall health and longevity is a test called VO2 max. </p><p>It sounds like the name of a sports car, but essentially it's a measurement of the size of someone's engine, and their capacity to use oxygen to generate power with their muscles, heart and lungs.</p><p><em>Dr. Luke Bennett - "There you go, that's the hardest part of your day done."</em></p><p>Norah O'Donnell: Even though you say I-- I scored fairly well on my VO2 max </p><p><em>Dr. Luke Bennett - "There we go, 42.1" </em></p><p><em>Norah O'Donnell - "OK that's good!" </em></p><p>Norah O'Donnell: You say I'm still not good enough for Dr. Peter Attia. </p>
<p>Dr. Peter Attia: Yes, your VO2 max was gonna place you at the 85th percentile for women your age. And I think it's worth taking a victory lap. But tomorrow, we should come back and plan on what we're gonna do.</p><p>Norah O'Donnell: You think anyone, whether they're 45 or 65, should be training like athletes. Not for the Olympics but essentially for advanced age.</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: Absolutely. Life is a sport.</p>
<p>Dr. Attia says the best drug to delay physical and cognitive decline is exercise, and he takes it in large doses. He aims for about 10 hours a week: cardio to burn fat; intense intervals for VO2 max; and weightlifting to maintain strength and muscle mass.</p><p>He developed his program after turning his back on the medical establishment nearly 20 years ago. </p><p>While training to be a cancer surgeon at Johns Hopkins he got burnt out caring for so many terminal patients. He quit his residency, and became a management consultant. After becoming a father and discovering he was at risk of developing diabetes, he made big changes, personally and professionally.</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: After my daughter was born, all I could think about was, "Oh my God," like, "I wanna-- I wanna have as much time as possible on this planet with this baby." </p>
<p>That's when he decided to become his own first patient in a new specialty: longevity medicine. Today he considers himself neither a primary care physician nor a provider of concierge care. </p><p>What Dr. Attia is prescribing is a radical change in how Americans think about their own health care, driven by the patient, focused on prevention — a practice he calls "Medicine 3.0." </p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: We're dying of heart disease, we're dying from stroke, cancer, dementia, Type II diabetes, and we I think have sort of come to realize that, "Hey, the playbook of Medicine 2.0 which is treat a disease when a disease is present, doesn't seem to work as well." And so the first principle of Medicine 3.0 is you have to take a much longer arc on the prevention of chronic disease.</p><p>That means using existing diagnostic tools in novel ways, like the DEXA scan, that checks bone density, as well as muscle mass and body fat. It typically costs under $300 and Attia says it's, quote, "almost criminal negligence" most women don't get one until they're 65. Another scan he employs is more costly, and not covered by insurance.</p><p>Norah O'Donnell: There are certain things that you recommend that are controversial, like regular preventive full-body MRIs.</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: Early detection matters. The earlier you can treat a cancer, the smaller the burden of the tumor at the time of treatment, the greater your odds of success. Now, let's talk about the flip side of that because it is going to detect a lot of things that are not cancer. That means you have a lot of false positives. If you're not willing to go through that experience, as traumatic as it is, you should not engage in this level of screening.</p><p>Norah O'Donnell: Do you get them?</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Attia: I do.</p><p>He also suggests patients get tested for the APOE gene, related to risk for Alzheimer's. </p><p>In 2019 Dr. Attia oversaw genetic testing for actor Chris Hemsworth, who learned he was eight to ten times more likely to develop Alzheimer's than the average person.</p><p>In total, Dr. Attia sees fewer than 75 patients, and there's a long waiting list.</p><p>Norah O'Donnell: And how much does it cost?</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: It is a six-figure program.</p><p>Norah O'Donnell: Like, $100,000, or $500,000, or $800,000? 'Cause that's a big range.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Attia: Much closer to $100,000 than $500,000.</p><p>Norah O'Donnell: That's a lot of money. I mean, what do you get for that?</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: Well.</p><p>Norah O'Donnell: You don't get-- I mean, you don't live forever.</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: Nope. You're getting access to me, a team of a couple other physicians, a strength and conditioning team, a nutrition team. And what you're really getting is a path to help you achieve your goal of living longer and living better.</p>
<p>The pitch has proved extremely popular.</p><p>His book "Outlive,"  part memoir, part medical manifesto, has sold nearly three million copies, and made him a top draw at longevity medicine events like this one.</p>
<p>And his podcast, that's been downloaded over 100 million times, tackles a wide range of topics, including menopause and nutrition.</p><p>Dr. Attia wants his patients to eat a lot of protein — more than double what the current nutritional guidelines recommend. </p><p>The doctor and a handful of his patients have also taken a drug called Rapamycin that's FDA-approved for use by transplant recipients. The drug has extended the lifespan of mice, but Dr. Attiastopped taking it, for now, because it gave him mouth sores, which can be a side effect.</p><p>There are physicians, including a respected professor of public health we spoke to, who are skeptical that his extraordinary regimen will result in an extra decade of healthy life. </p><p>Norah O'Donnell: When a fellow physician calls some of what you're talking about, "Hocus pocus"?</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: People are entitled to think what they want. And just because someone is a physician, doesn't mean they're even remotely equipped to evaluate the merits of exercise physiology. Remember, I went to Stanford Medical School, right? How many hours of education do you think I received on exercise?</p><p>Norah O'Donnell: Probably, a few hours?</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Attia: Zero hours. And how many hours did I receive on nutrition? Zero hours. It was 25 years ago, so, maybe things have changed. But I'm pretty sure that if you're talking to other esteemed physicians, they're in the same bucket as me. So, you know, they might not be the ones that are best equipped to be my critics.</p><p>Our last morning in Austin, Dr. Attia took us for a ruck, a hike with weighted backpacks.</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: This, to me, is as much about mental health and socialization, being in nature. And rucking is simply a vehicle to get that. </p><p>Norah O'Donnell: How much work do you do on your emotional and mental health? </p>
<p>Dr. Peter Attia: A lot. I mean, it's-- as much a practice as what I put into exercise or, you know, blood work, and cancer screening, and all the other things that make up physical health. </p><p>Attia has been open about dealing with depression and anger stemming from abuse he suffered as a child. Through therapy, including two stays at inpatient care facilities, he says he turned a corner about five years ago. </p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline. But if we're being deliberate and active on our emotional health, it can actually improve.</p>
<p>He says progress was only possible because his wife of more than 20 years, Jill, stood by him. </p><p>Norah O'Donnell: There is plenty of data on longevity and people-- living long that have very strong relationships. </p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: Yes. Just like the exercise data, I don't think this is just a correlation. I really think that there is also some causality that flows from the end of having great relationships to living a longer life. </p><p>Norah O'Donnell: What's the point of living long if you don't have people to share it with?</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: What's-- or– "What's the purpose of living longer if you're unhappy?" </p><p>Dr. Attia plans on launching a new digital health app next year. He says that 80% of his program does not require a physician, and is adamant it's never too late to begin delaying the inevitable. </p><p>Norah O'Donnell: How long do you want to live?</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Attia: You know, I want to live to be old enough to have a meaningful relationship with as many of my grandkids as I can. That probably means, making it into my 90s.</p><p>Norah O'Donnell: 'Cause you must be plotting that with your VO2 max?</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. You know, it's funny, we do an exercise with our patients, which is called the timeline exercise. So if we were doing this for you, we would draw-- you know, we would draw a line for Norah. So you're 51.</p><p>Norah O'Donnell: Yeah.</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: And then, I would draw a tick at 61, 71, 81, 91, 101, and then, we would draw all three of your kids. And then, we would start to extrapolate, when do you think they're gonna have kids? And so you're gonna draw their first grandkid, and we're gonna map your life out, according to this timeline. And you're gonna see, pretty quickly, what it's all about. </p><p>Norah O'Donnell: That really kind of puts it in great perspective for me.</p><p>Dr. Peter Attia: So, yes, I've mapped my life out, in that regard. And I know that the difference between being 80 and 90 is huge, in terms of what I can have with those kids.</p>

<div class="article-title">Dr. Peter Attia: Exercise is key to longevity</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>When most people think of longevity, they imagine adding years to their lives. But to Dr. Peter Attia, one of the leading voices in the emerging field of longevity medicine, living longer is about more than counting birthdays. It's about improving the quality of physical, emotional, and cognitive health — and he says intense exercise is part of the way to achieve it.</p><p>"At this point in my life, I feel like I'm making fewer novel insights around how to manage cholesterol and blood pressure than I am in thinking about ways to get people to be more compliant with exercise," Attia told 60 Minutes contributing correspondent Norah O'Donnell.</p><p>A former surgeon trained at Johns Hopkins, Attia now has a podcast and a bestselling book that have made him a public figure in the growing movement to optimize health and extend life. He says his methods are data-driven and rooted in the science of performance.</p><h2>The power of exercise</h2><p>Attia emphasizes that among all the habits that promote a longer life — not smoking, eating well, and sleeping enough — exercise stands out above the rest.</p><p>"The data are pretty clear," Attia said. "When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure."</p><p>He explains that maintaining lifelong fitness requires both consistency and intensity. That means incorporating "zone two" exercise — steady activity like jogging or cycling at a pace where you can still hold a conversation — and also including sessions of "zone four" high-intensity training, the kind that leaves you breathless and unable to speak more than a few words.</p>
<h2>The lifespan metric that matters most: VO2 max</h2><p>When 60 Minutes visited Attia's exclusive gym in Austin, O'Donnell underwent the same physical evaluation his patients do, including a demanding VO2 max test.</p><p>VO2 max measures how much oxygen your body can use during intense exercise, which is a reflection of your cardiorespiratory fitness. According to Attia, it is one of the strongest predictors of longevity.</p><p>"Your VO2 max is more strongly correlated with your lifespan than any other metric I can measure," Attia said. "It predicts your risk of death from any cause, even more than your blood pressure, cholesterol, or smoking status."</p><p>But fancy lab equipment is not needed to estimate a VO2 max score. People can test it at home by performing the Cooper Test, and all that is needed is a treadmill or a watch and a local running track. To test yourself, warm up for 10-15 minutes by doing light jogging and dynamic stretching, then run as far as you can in 12 minutes. By plugging the result into an online calculator, you can approximate your VO2 max score.</p>
<p>Many wearable devices — including the Apple Watch and WHOOP — also provide a VO2 max estimate that, while not perfect, is often close to lab results.</p><p>Attia's goal for his patients is not just to be "high" for their age group, but elite, equivalent to someone 20 years younger.</p>
<h2>Grip strength and the brain</h2><p>Attia's focus on fitness extends beyond the treadmill. He also looks closely at muscle strength, particularly grip strength, as a powerful indicator of health and cognitive resilience.</p><p>"If you look at the correlation between grip strength and dementia risk or mortality, it's staggering," he said. "Grip strength is a proxy for overall strength, and that kind of strength is acquired, not inherited. The work you do to build it is what protects your brain."</p><p>Testing grip strength can be simple. For adults over 40, Attia suggests hanging from a pull-up bar — 90 seconds for women, two minutes for men — or performing a farmer's carry, walking for a minute while holding weights equal to roughly 75% of your body weight.</p><h2>Train like an athlete — for life</h2><p>For Attia, exercise is medicine. Strength training and cardiovascular conditioning are essential not just for performance, but for longevity and mental sharpness.</p><p>To still be active in your 80s, Attia says, you must start training like an athlete in your 40s and 50s.</p>
<p>"Life is a sport," Attia said. "It comes at you fast. It's unpredictable."</p><p><em>The video above was edited by Scott Rosann. </em></p>

<div class="article-title">A rare look at life inside Nicolás Maduro's Venezuela</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Over the past few weeks, the long, frosty relationship between the U.S. and Venezuela reached a boiling point. The United States launched a series of strikes against vessels alleged to be carrying drugs, calling it a counter-narcotics mission. But the growing military buildup of American forces in the region suggests there may be another target: President Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan dictator who's been in America's crosshairs for years. This summer, the U.S. Justice Department announced a $50 million reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest, accusing him of being a drug kingpin. On Friday, the Trump administration escalated its military campaign, sending the world's largest <span class="link">aircraft carrier</span> to the region. But not much has been seen or heard from peopleinsideVenezuela. Earlier this month, we obtained a rare visa from the Maduro government, packed our bags for Caracas, and found a country on the brink.</p><p>A patchwork of stacked, cinder block homes cling to the hillsides of Caracas. Instability isn't just an architectural feature in Venezuela, it's a way of life. We saw it at a busy market. There was heated haggling over prices and anxious whispers about the American ships off the coast.</p>
<p>Sharyn Alfonsi: Are you afraid of the Americans? Or are you afraid about speaking about it?</p><p>Woman (Speaking Spanish): Si…</p><p>Sharyn Alfonsi: Talking about it. OK. I understand.</p>
<p>Man (Speaking Spanish): "One feels nervous and anxious." "We don't want anything to happen." </p><p>This woman chimed in, "The Venezuelan people shouldn't be held responsible for the actions of its president."</p><p>Just then off camera, a man told her, "You can't say that. Who provided you with this space to work?" He was wearing a hat with an emblem of the government civilian-military force.</p><p>Sharyn Alfonsi: What do you think about what's going on off the coast?</p>
<p>Roman (Speaking Spanish): "It's an abusive tactic from America," he said. "We're a sovereign country." </p><p>F-35 fighter jets, eight U.S. warships and an estimated 10,000 U.S. troops are now in the Caribbean, with more on the way.</p><p>Sharyn Alfonsi: Does it feel like something's about to happen?</p><p>Woman (speaking Spanish): Yes, she said. "It feels very, very heavy."</p><p>The weight of uncertainty and the rumble of armored vehicles can be felt throughout the country. An estimated 125,000 members of <span class="link">Venezuela's military</span> have mobilized. While we were there, the government was holding emergency drills and urging civilians to prepare for combat. It's all a bit of theater and a response to this<em>. </em>Since September, the U.S. military has blown up at least 10 vessels, killing more than three dozen alleged drug smugglers, most of them off the coast of Venezuela. </p><p>Ambassador James Story: What I can say is that I've used this phrase before, this is like cookin' an egg with a blowtorch. F-35s, Arleigh Burke class destroyers, submarines aren't normally what we need to go after small boats, fishing boats.</p>
<p>Ambassador James Story was the last American diplomat at the now closed U.S. embassy in Venezuela. He says the show of U.S. force is likely intended to oust Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela's dictator. </p>
<p>Ambassador James Story: This is a very bad actor sitting on top of the world's largest known reserves of oil, plus the critical minerals that will fuel the 21st century economy, and he's in bed with our strategic competitors. </p><p>Sharyn Alfonsi: And how has he been able to cling to power for as long as he has?</p><p>Ambassador James Story: I mean, let's-- let's be very clear. This is a criminal organization masquerading as a government. This is an individual who is under indictment for narcotics trafficking-- commits human rights violations. Someone who has used the apparatus of the state to throw people in jail, to torture them, to kill them.</p><p>In January, the Trump administration briefly engaged with Maduro's government. negotiating a deal for the release of six U.S. prisoners, arrested while visiting the country, and for the resumption of <span class="link">flights carrying Venezuelans deported</span> from the United States back to their country. But in August, the olive branch snapped. </p><p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that staggering reward for Maduro's arrest, <span class="link">$50 million</span>. Which is why we were stunned when, after months of negotiations, Maduro agreed to do an interview with us. Maduro's ministers chose the time and place, the ballroom of a busy hotel in Caracas. But minutes before the interview was finally set to begin, it was called off. We were told the president's minister of defense and head of intelligence said it was no longer safe to do the interview. </p><p>Maduro has been defiant for months despite the bounty on his head, openly challenging the U.S. and its accusations against him in front of crowds of supporters. After he bagged our interview, we thought, perhaps he was packing his bags. </p><p>So, we just hopped into a taxicab in Caracas, because we were told that President Maduro has just appeared at a rally in central Caracas for an Indigenous Peoples Day event, which is apparently being held on the middle of a highway. And he's surrounded by hundreds of people. This is two days after he canceled his interview with us.</p>
<p>Maduro urged the crowd to defend the republic. But privately, he was making concessions. Last week, President Trump confirmed reports that President Maduro offered the U.S. a stake in the country's oil to avoid conflict. </p><p><em>President Trump: "He has offered everything…. </em><span class="link"><em>He's offered everything</em></span><em>, you're right. You know why? Because he doesn't want to f*** around with the United States."</em></p><p>Maduro has repeatedly called U.S. accusations that he oversees a narco state, quote, "disinformation." Most fentanyl is produced in Mexico or China and, according to the DEA, Venezuela is not a major producer of cocaine either, but it is a transit route for it. On Thursday, Maduro appealed for peace, in English. </p><p><em>President Maduro: Not war. Not war. Not war. Yes peace, yes peace. Yes peace. </em></p><p>As a gesture of goodwill, Venezuela is still accepting planes full of deportees from the U.S. Maduro frames their return as a triumph, repatriating Venezuelans from harsh conditions in U.S. detention. But most of the deportees we saw told us they felt defeated. We were with this 4-year-old girl as she was escorted off a plane by a government minister.</p><p>And taken into a room where a crush of state TV and her family were waiting. Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida says Maduro should hop on a one-way flight himself.</p><p>Sen. Rick Scott: If I was Maduro, I'd head to Russia or China right now.</p>
<p>Sharyn Alfonsi: Because?</p><p>Sen. Rick Scott: His days are-- are numbered. Something's gonna happen. Whether it's internal or external, I think something's gonna happen.</p>
<p>Sharyn Alfonsi: The firepower that's off the coast, right, this is an armada, this is a lot of U.S. forces. Are we about to invade Venezuela?</p><p>Sen. Rick Scott: I don't think so. I-- I mean, I-- I-- if we do-- I'd be surprised. </p><p>Earlier this month, President Trump announced he approved <span class="link">covert CIA operations</span> inside Venezuela.</p><p>Sharyn Alfonsi: What do you think removing Maduro would signal to other socialist regimes in the area?</p><p>Sen. Rick Scott: It'll be the end of Cuba. </p>
<p>Cuba relies on subsidized Venezuelan oil to prop up its economy. </p><p>Sen. Rick Scott: America is gonna take care of the Southern Hemisphere. And we're going to make sure that there's freedom and democracy.</p><p>Freedom isn't the only thing in short supply in Venezuela. </p><p>Hunger, chronic blackouts, and a scarcity of essential medicines plague the country. Today, more than 70% of residents live in poverty. It is a stunning reversal of fortune for a nation that was once one of the wealthiest countries in the world.</p><p>Venezuela's economy was crippled by disastrous socialist policies and mismanagement, a crisis exacerbated by 20 years of U.S. sanctions imposed in direct response to the regime's anti-democratic actions, human rights violations and corruption. That triggered triple digit inflation and a humanitarian crisis. </p><p>Back at the market in Caracas, this woman said the $50 a week that she earns isn't enough to feed her family and courageously answered this question.</p><p>Sharyn Alfonsi: -- What do you think would happen if President Maduro was removed from office?</p>
<p>Woman: (Speaking Spanish): "Venezuela would change," she said, "We would all be free."</p><p>She told us she has plans to move to Spain in a few months. Nearly 8 million Venezuelans have fled the country in the last decade, roughly one-fifth of its population. Most of those who remained hoped <span class="link">last year's presidential election</span> would be a turning point. But even after tallies showed the opposition won nearly 70% of the vote, Maduro refused to leave, stealing the presidency. Protests were met with brutal crackdowns, which the U.N. says included jailing, torturing and even murder. We met Phil Gunson in Caracas. He's lived in Venezuela for 26 years and is a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, a non-governmental organization. Gunson is a rarity in Venezuela, an expert willing to speak openly about the government and Maduro's odds of surviving the current crisis.</p><p>Phil Gunson: The asking price is Maduro's head. I mean, he has to go.</p><p>Sharyn Alfonsi: And he's still going out to events in front of big crowds. Why is he not in a bunker?</p><p>Phil Gunson: I think, because the crowds are the defense. That-- that-- that's my suspicion<strong>. </strong>Once or twice lately, he's done something quite unusual, which is to hold his events in hotels. You know, the U.S. isn't gonna kill him in a hotel, obviously. </p>
<p>Gunson says even if Maduro steps aside the transition to democracy would be bumpy at best. María Corina Machado, the opposition leader who recently won the <span class="link">Nobel Peace Prize</span>, has been in hiding for months but has said she has a plan. </p><p>Sharyn Alfonsi: There are reports the opposition says they have this hundred-hour plan with the Trump administration for a peaceful transition. Is there any guarantee that the transition will be peaceful?</p>
<p>Phil Gunson: There's no guarantee at all. And in fact-- one of the things that worries me most is that there's been no apparent negotiation with a key element in all of this story, which is the Venezuelan armed forces. If the Venezuelan armed forces don't go along with this, and by the armed forces I really mean the high command, the people who-- who give the orders--then there's a possibility perhaps the armed forces might split, there's a possibility they might oppose a new government coming in. </p><p>He says well-armed Colombian guerilla groups that Maduro allows to operate in Venezuela might also resist a change in power. </p><p>Sharyn Alfonsi: Is there a scenario that the U.S. has to put boots on the ground to keep order?</p><p>Phil Gunson: I can't see a scenario in which they wouldn't have to put boots on the ground. I mean, if the U.S. is responsible. It's the-- kind of the Pottery Barn principle, isn't it? If you break it, you own it. You have to protect the government that you just put in power. And that means I think thousands of troops.</p><p>But Sen. Rick Scott doesn't think it will get to that point.</p><p>Sharyn Alfonsi: If it all goes to hell is the U.S. willing to put boots on the ground in Venezuela?</p><p>Sen. Rick Scott: Well, I think the American public is-- is tired of forever wars right now. So I think it-- it's very difficult for us to-- make a commitment that we're gonna-- we're gonna do something like that. But I do believe that-- that internationally there would be-- troops that would go in if-- if they needed to. </p>
<p>In Washington, lawmakers are debating the legality of the U.S. military action. Some say the strikes amount to extrajudicial killings. The Trump administration insists they are lawful and self defense. </p><p>At the same time, Admiral Alvin Holsey, the head of U.S. Southern Command and the officer in charge of all Caribbean activity, suddenly announced his retirement, two years ahead of schedule, offering no public explanation and raising more questions about the Trump administration's plan.</p><p>Sharyn Alfonsi: If the administration were to turn around all those warships and said, "OK, we've done everything we need to do here," what would that mean for President Maduro?</p><p>Phil Gunson: It would be an enormous political triumph for Maduro because he'd be able to say forever afterwards-- you know, "I stood up to the U.S., I stood up to the empire," as they call it," and the empire retreated.</p><p><em>Produced by Michael Karzis.

<div class="article-title">Longevity doctor advises exercise, tests, and protein to prep for advanced age</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>After the birth of his first child, Dr. Peter Attia became his own first patient in a new speciality: longevity medicine. </p><p>Today, the Stanford-trained doctor is prescribing a radical change in how Americans think about their own health care. His patient-driven, prevention-focused "Medicine 3.0" concept is designed to help people thrive in the last decade of their lives, a period typically plagued by sickness and immobility.</p><p>"The marginal decade's not going anywhere. We will all have a final decade of life," Attia, 52, told 60 Minutes contributing correspondent Norah O'Donnell. "My goal is to make the marginal decade as enjoyable as possible."</p><h2>Why training for the marginal decade is important</h2><p>More than 90% of American senior citizens suffer from at least one chronic disease, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The decline starts to become more severe at age 75, when Attia says population-level data shows that "both men and women fall off a cliff," in terms of physical activity and muscle mass.</p>
<p>"At the population level, it's unmistakable what happens at the age of 75. That's what we're up against," Attia said. "That's what I'm thinking about in the practice is, how do I create an escape velocity that gets somebody another 15 years there?"</p>
<p>He tells his patients that if they don't take preemptive action to reduce the rate of decline, they'll operate at about 50% capacity both cognitively and physically in their final decade.</p><p>"We're dying of heart disease, we're dying from stroke, cancer, dementia, Type II diabetes, and we, I think, have sort of come to realize that, 'Hey, the playbook of Medicine 2.0, which is treat a disease when a disease is present, doesn't seem to work as well,'" Attia said. "So the first principle of Medicine 3.0 is you have to take a much longer arc on the prevention of chronic disease."</p><p>Attia was training to become a cancer surgeon at Johns Hopkins, but got burned out performing surgery on so many patients whose illnesses were terminal. He quit with just two years remaining in his residency, and became a management consultant. After becoming a father and learning he was at risk of developing diabetes almost 20 years ago, Attia made big changes, personally and professionally. </p>
<p>"All I could think about was, 'Oh my God, like, I wanna have as much time as possible on this planet with this baby'" Attia said. </p><h2>The work that goes into preparing for advanced age</h2><p>Attia has fewer than 75 patients, with billionaires among them. His patients pay hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to be part of his practice. Though he does not disclose the precise annual fee, he told O'Donnell that the "six-figure program" costs "much closer to $100,000 than $500,000." </p><p>His patients' treatment starts in Austin, Texas, where Attia is based. Their initiation includes two days of intense physical evaluation. </p><p>"I think this is the neglected part of medical testing, is how fit are you, how strong are you, how well do you move? And in many ways, these tests are even more predictive of how long you're going to live than what I might get out of your bloodwork," Attia said. </p>
<p>He and his team examine patients' muscle mass, cardiorespiratory fitness and strength levels, which Attia says are more highly correlated with lifespan than even cholesterol or blood pressure. Attia says the key indicator of overall health and longevity is a test called VO2 max, which is essentially a measure of someone's capacity to use oxygen to generate power with their muscles, heart and lungs. The test is usually completed on a treadmill or stationary bike. </p><p>The best drug to delay physical and cognitive decline is exercise, Attia said. He personally aims for about 10 hours a week, with a mix of modalities: cardio to burn fat, intense intervals for VO2 max and weightlifting to maintain strength and muscle mass.</p><p>All that exercise also comes with a recommended diet, which Dr. Attia says is needed to maintain muscle mass and prevent frailty. He wants his patients to eat about one gram of protein for every pound they weigh, every day. It's more than double what the standard <span class="link">nutritional </span>guidelines recommend. </p>
<h2>Scans, tests and drugs</h2><p>Attia also uses existing diagnostic tools, such as the DEXA scan, in novel ways. The scan, which checks bone density, muscle mass and body fat, typically costs under $300. To Attia, it's "almost criminal negligence" that most women don't get one until they're 65. </p><p>In patients' DEXA scans, Attia is looking for any indications of osteopenia — a risk for falls and frailty — as well as any buildup of fat between organs, called visceral fat, which can be linked to increased risk of both cancer and cardiovascular disease. Attia says it's "almost criminal negligence" that most women won't get a DEXA scan until they're 65, because it can allow physicians to notice potential signs of bone fracture before it's too late.</p><p>He also undergoes, and encourages his patients to get, more costly full-body MRI scans as a regular, preventative measure, noting that early detection makes it easier to treat a tumor and improve the odds of success. But he cautions patients that there is a flip side.</p><p>The American College of Radiology does not recommend preventative, full-body MRI scans, saying in a 2023 statement,"To date, there is no documented evidence that total body screening is cost-efficient or effective in prolonging life. In addition, the ACR is concerned that such procedures will lead to the identification of numerous non-specific findings that will not ultimately improve patients' health but will result in unnecessary follow-up testing and procedures, as well as significant expense."</p><p>"It is going to detect a lot of things that are not cancer. That means you have a lot of false positives," Attia said. "If you're not willing to go through that experience, as traumatic as it is, you should not engage in this level of screening."</p><p>He also suggests patients get tested for the APOE gene, which is related to risk for Alzheimer's disease. </p><p>Attia and a handful of his patients have also used a drug called Rapamycin, FDA-approved for transplant recipients, which has extended lifespan in mice. He's stopped the drug for now because it gave him mouth sores, which can be a side effect. </p>
<h2>Benefits beyond exercise</h2><p>For Attia, exercise carries much more than a physical benefit, even when he goes hiking with 45 pounds on his back. He says the activity known as rucking is an opportunity for him to socialize, be in nature, and to focus on his mental and emotional health.</p><p>He views that work as being just as important as the work he does on his physical health. Attia spent decades dealing with depression and anger stemming from abuse he suffered as a child, which he discussed in his best-selling book, "Outlive." Through therapy, including two stays at inpatient care facilities, Attia says he turned a corner about five years ago.</p>
<p>"By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline. But if we're being deliberate and active on our emotional health, it can actually improve," Attia said. </p><p>He says his progress was only possible because his wife of more than 20 years, Jill, stood by him. Multiple studies have shown the connection between longevity and having strong relationships with others.</p><p>"Just like the exercise data, I don't think this is just a correlation," Attia said. "I really think that there is also some causality that flows from the end of having great relationships to living a longer life."</p><h2>Will Attia's regimen result in an extra decade of healthy life?</h2><p>Attia plans on launching a digital health app called Outlive next year. He says that 80% of his program — including altering your nutrition, exercise routine and sleep – does not require a physician, and is adamant that it's never too late to work on slowing the inevitable decline. </p><p>There are physicians, including a respected professor of public health 60 Minutes spoke with, who are skeptical about the regimen Attia prescribes. </p>
<p>"People are entitled to think what they want. And just because someone is a physician, doesn't mean they're even remotely equipped to evaluate the merits of exercise physiology," Attia said. </p><p>In Attia's time at the Stanford University School of Medicine, exercise and nutrition were not part of the curriculum. </p><p>"It was 25 years ago, so, maybe, things have changed. But I'm pretty sure that if you're talking to other esteemed physicians, they're in the same bucket as me," Attia said. "They might not be the ones that are best equipped to be my critics."</p><p>Attia's not letting skeptics stop him. He's mapped out his life with the goal of living into his 90s and having the most enjoyable last decade possible. </p><p>"I want to live to be old enough to have a meaningful relationship with as many of my grandkids as I can," Attia said, later noting, "I know that the difference between being 80 and 90 is huge, in terms of what I can have with those kids."</p>

<div class="article-title">Nick Mangold, New York Jets legend, dies at 41, team announces</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Nick Mangold, a legendary player in the history of the New York Jets, has died suddenly from complications of kidney disease, the team announced Sunday.</p><p>The news comes two weeks after the seven-time NFL Pro-Bowler revealed he was undergoing dialysis and <span class="link">looking for a kidney donor</span>. He was 41. </p><p>Mangold said in a letter to the Jets community that he was diagnosed with a genetic defect in 2006, which led to his chronic kidney disease. The letter said he had been going through a "tough stretch" recently.</p><h2>"More than a legendary center"</h2><p>Mangold played his entire career with New York from 2006-2016. He was inducted into the team's Ring of Honor in 2022 as one of the greatest centers of all time. </p><p>"Nick was more than a legendary center. He was the heartbeat of our offensive line for a decade and a beloved teammate whose leadership and toughness defined an era of Jets football," Jets owner Woody Johnson said in a statement on the team's website. "Off the field, Nick's wit, warmth, and unwavering loyalty made him a cherished member of our extended Jets family." </p>
<p>The Jets drafted Mangold out of Ohio State with the 29th overall pick in 2006. He started 171 games over his 11 seasons, including seven in the playoffs.</p>
<p>"Nick Mangold will forever be a Jet," Johnson added.</p><p>"I was fortunate to have the opportunity to lace them up with you every Sunday," Pro Football Hall of Famer Darrelle Revis, Mangold's teammate for eight years, wrote on X. "I will miss you and forever cherish our moments in the locker room. Love you buddy."</p><h2>Mangold was an ironman with an everyman quality</h2><p>Mangold started every game during his first five seasons and missed only four games in his first 10 years before an ankle injury limited him to eight games in 2016. He was released by the team in 2017 and didn't play that season. The following year, he signed a one-day contract with the Jets to officially retire as a member of the team.</p><p>"Rest in peace to my brother &amp; teammate Nick Mangold," tweeted former running back Thomas Jones, who played three years with Mangold. "I keep seeing your smiling face in the huddle bro. One of the kindest people I've ever met. One of the greatest interior linemen to ever play the game. This one hurts. Surreal."</p>
<p>"It's brutal," former Jets coach and current ESPN analyst Rex Ryan said during "Sunday NFL Countdown" while fighting through tears. "Such a great young man. I had the pleasure of coaching him for all six years with the Jets (from 2009-14). I remember it was obvious I was getting fired, my last game, Mangold's injured -- like, injured -- and he comes to me and says, 'I'm playing this game.' And he wanted to play for me.</p>
<p>"That's what I remember about this kid. He was awesome. And it's just way too young. I feel so bad for his wife and family. (This is) rough."</p><h2>Mangold was the ultimate team guy</h2><p>Mangold's No. 74 jersey remained a popular one for fans to wear at games, even nine years after playing his final NFL game. He was active with charitable events and often dressed as Santa Claus for the team's holiday celebrations for children.</p><p>"Nick was the embodiment of consistency, strength, and leadership," Jets vice chairman Christopher Johnson said in a statement. "For over a decade, he anchored our offensive line with unmatched skill and determination, earning the respect of teammates, opponents and fans alike. His contributions on the field were extraordinary -- but it was his character, humility, and humor off the field that made him unforgettable."</p><p>Mangold is survived by his wife, Jennifer, and their four children Matthew, Eloise, Thomas and Charlotte.</p><p>Mangold is eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2026. The team said a list of 52 players, including Mangold, will be narrowed down over the coming months as up to eight new members are selected.</p><p>The Hall of Fame inductees will be announced the day before Super Bowl LX. </p>

<div class="article-title">Graham says land strikes in Venezuela are a "real possibility"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>As the U.S. has been carrying out <span class="link">airstrikes against Venezuelan and Colombian vessels</span> in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean that the Trump administration has accused of carrying drugs and cartel members, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday that <span class="link">land strikes in Venezuela</span> — a significant escalation — are a "real possibility."</p><p>"I think President Trump's made a decision that [Nicolas] Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, is an indicted drug, drug trafficker, that it's time for him to go, that Venezuela and Colombia have been safe havens for narco-terrorists for too long, and President Trump told me yesterday that he plans to brief members of Congress when he gets back from Asia about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia," <span class="link">Graham said Sunday on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan</span>."</p><p>Mr. Trump suggested last week that land strikes are "going to be next," saying on Thursday that "the drugs coming in by sea are like 5% of what they were a year ago" due to the strikes. Mr. Trump did not offer any evidence to back up this claim, and members of Congress have also said the administration hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the targeted vessels are carrying drugs.</p><p>As of Friday, at least 43 people have been killed in the U.S. strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific that have occurred on 10 vessels since Sept. 2. Last week, the <span class="link">Colombian government called</span> on the U.S.  "to respect the norms dictated by international law" and cease the strikes. </p><p>Graham on Sunday said there will be a Congressional briefing on land strikes, not an invasion, although he also called for the removal of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. Graham repeatedly cited former President George H.W. Bush's invasion of Panama in 1989, saying the Bush administration didn't receive Congressional approval for that mission. </p>
<p>"Bush 41 went into Panama to replace the leadership there, because the Panama leadership, Panamanian leadership, were working with drug cartels to threaten our country," Graham said. </p><p>Although the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the sole authority to declare war, Graham repeatedly said he is confident the Trump administration has the authority to carry out the strikes. Democrats and even some Republicans have criticized the White House's action.</p><p>"To the other senators, you deserve more information, and you're going to get more information, but there is no requirement for Congress to declare war before the commander-in-chief can use force," Graham said. "Panama and Grenada are two examples in our backyard, where Republican presidents chose to go after countries and leaders that were threatening our people."</p><p>Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press" that the Trump administration's actions in the Caribbean are "murder." </p>
<p>"If this president feels that they're doing something illegally, then he should be using the Coast Guard," Gallego said. "If it's an act of war, then you use our military, and then you come and talk to us first. But this is murder. It's sanctioned murder that he is doing." </p><p>Graham pushed back against Gallego's remarks, saying on Sunday that "this is not murder. This is protecting America from being poisoned by narco-terrorists coming from Venezuela and Colombia."</p>

<section class="content__body">
<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that additional 100% tariffs on China are "effectively off the table" after a "very good two-day meeting" with Beijing's top trade negotiator.</p><p>"I'm not going to get ahead of the two leaders who will be meeting in Korea on Thursday, but I can tell you we had a very good two days," Bessent said of President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. </p><p>Bessent, who has been leading trade talks with China, <span class="link">appeared Sunday on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan</span>" from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where President Trump began a three-country visit to Asia. Mr. Trump is expected to meet with China's president at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea on Thursday.</p><p>China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, and tariffs on Chinese imports currently stand at 30%. Earlier this month, President Trump <span class="link">threatened</span> an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports by early November in a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. </p><p>Mr. Trump warned that the tariffs would take effect if Beijing couldn't reach a deal with the U.S., citing new Chinese export controls. But after the meetings, Bessent said he expects "the threat of the 100% has gone away, as has the threat of the immediate imposition of the Chinese initiating a worldwide export control regime."</p>
<p>The treasury secretary praised Mr. Trump for giving him and his team an advantage, saying the threat of a 100% additional tariff "did give us a great deal of leverage".</p><p>"President Trump's very good at creating leverage for us," Bessent added.</p><p>At the trade meetings, Bessent said he and his Chinese counterpart discussed "a wide variety of issues," from rare-earth magnets to purchases of American agricultural products to the Chinese helping combat the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. He also said the TikTok deal announced last month is <span class="link">set to be finalized</span> on Thursday.</p>

<div class="article-title">TikTok deal to be finalized Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that the TikTok deal announced last month is set to be finalized on Thursday when President Trump meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p><p>"We reached a final deal on TikTok. We reached one in Madrid, and I believe that as of today, all the details are ironed out, and that will be for the two leaders to consummate that transaction on Thursday in Korea," <span class="link">Bessent said on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan</span>."</p><p>President Trump <span class="link">signed an executive order</span> last month that paved the way for a deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors. But the details were not immediately clear. Asked about the details of the TikTok transaction Sunday, Bessent said he is "not part of the commercial side of the transaction."</p><p>"My remit was to get the Chinese to agree to approve the transaction, and I believe we successfully accomplished that over the past two days," he said </p><p>Bessent spoke from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where President Trump began a three-country <span class="link">visit to Asia</span>. Mr. Trump is expected to meet with Xi at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea on Thursday.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump said last month that Chinese President Xi Jinping had signed off on the deal during a call. The deal represented a "qualified divestiture," satisfying a law passed by Congress in April 2024 that required TikTok's China-based parent company to divest or face a ban. The move also delayed enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for the agreement on the video sharing social media app's operations in the U.S. to be finalized. </p><p>The White House outlined last month that the deal would establish a U.S.-based "joint venture" made up of a majority of U.S. investors and owners, along with a board of directors with a majority of Americans. ByteDance and its affiliates were set to own less than 20% of the new entity. The White House said a consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)</p><p>Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, also appeared Sunday on "Face the Nation." Moolenaar, who previously expressed concern about the TikTok deal, said Sunday that said "as long as the Chinese are involved, I think there's reason for distrust." </p><p>When asked about ByteDance and its affiliates continuing to own up to 20% of the new entity, Moolenaar added, "I'm still concerned about it."</p>
<p>"The Chinese report to the Chinese Communist Party, and they will leverage every advantage they get," Moolenaar said. "But the president has set a goal of making this available to the American people, following the law that was passed in a bipartisan way, and I trust that they are doing that."</p>

<div class="article-title">Milei triumphs in Argentine midterm elections closely watched by Washington</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei won decisive victories in key districts in midterm elections Sunday, clinching a crucial vote of confidence that strengthens his ability to carry out his radical free-market experiment with billions of dollars in backing from the Trump administration.</p>
<p>In the election widely seen as a referendum on Milei's past two years in office, his upstart La Libertad Avanza party scored over 40% of votes compared with 31% for the left-leaning populist opposition movement, known as Peronism, exceeding analysts' projections.</p> <p>Milei, a key ideological ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, said his party and allied blocs picked up 14 seats in the Senate and 64 in the lower house of Congress on Sunday, bolstering the government's support in the legislature enough to uphold presidential vetoes and block impeachment efforts.</p>
<p>At La Libertad Avanza headquarters late Sunday in downtown Buenos Aires, a beaming Milei hailed the election sweep as a mandate to press forward with his spending cuts and introduce ambitious tax and labor reforms. The results also automatically position him as a candidate for reelection in 2027.</p> <p>"The Argentine people have decided to leave behind 100 years of decadence," Milei exulted as his supporters cheered, referring to a succession of Peronist governments that brought Argentina infamy for its inflationary spirals and sovereign debt defaults.</p> <p>"Today we have passed the turning point. Today we begin the construction of a great Argentina."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">High stakes include $40 billion from the U.S.</h3> <p>Perhaps never has an Argentine legislative election generated so much interest in Washington and Wall Street.</p> <p>Trump appeared to condition a $20 billion currency swap deal with Argentina's central bank and an additional $20 billion loan from private banks on a good showing for Milei in national midterms, threatening to rescind the assistance for the cash-strapped country in the event of a Peronist victory.</p> <p>"If he wins we're staying with him, and if he doesn't win, we're gone," Trump said after welcoming Milei to the White House earlier this month.</p> <p>Those contentious comments added to mounting pressure on Milei, who has scrambled to avert a currency crisis since the Peronist opposition won a landslide victory in Buenos Aires provincial polls last month. Argentina's bonds and currency nosedived as markets sensed that the public was losing patience with Milei's reforms and that the midterm race would be tight.</p>
<p>To stem the run on the peso, Milei burned through billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves to shore up the peso. In an extraordinary move, the U.S. Treasury then came to the rescue, selling dollars to help meet soaring demand for greenbacks and finalizing the credit line.</p> <p>In the end, the Peronist alliance performed poorly, underscoring how weak the once-dominant movement has become in the Milei era, largely as a result of internal divisions. Markets were widely expected to rally on Monday.</p> <p>"For foreign investors, this outcome is a relief because it shows that the Milei program can be sustainable," said Marcelo J. García, the America's director for the geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage.</p> <p>"It leaves the opposition weakened and fragmented, just as it was when Milei won the presidency in December 2023," Garcia added.</p> <p>The Peronist coalition has struggled to channel rising public anger with Milei's painful austerity measures into a new political strategy after delivering the economic shambles that the chain saw-wielding outsider inherited in late 2023.</p> <p>Trump, while on his way to Japan on Monday, posted on Truth Social that Milei was "doing a wonderful job" after his party beat expectations in midterm elections.</p> <p>"Our confidence in him was justified by the People of Argentina," Trump wrote.</p> <p>Milei responded to Trump's post, calling him "a great friend" of Argentina and thanking him for "trusting the Argentine people."</p> <h3 class="edTag">A changed electoral map</h3> <p>The results showed Milei's young libertarian party gaining support across the country — including in some surprising corners that have long been under the sway of Peronism.</p> <p>In the closely watched Buenos Aires province, a Peronist stronghold home to nearly 40% of the electorate, La Libertad Avanza eked out a razor-thin victory Sunday. Just last month, the Peronists beat Milei's party there by a whopping 14 percentage points.</p>
<p>Axel Kicillof, governor of Buenos Aires province and the most influential elected official in the Peronist opposition, criticized Trump for putting his thumb on the scale.</p> <p>He warned that the billions of dollars in financial aid from the U.S. Treasury and investment banks would do nothing to help ordinary Argentines squeezed by Milei's cuts to subsidies or forced out of business by a contracting economy.</p> <p>"I want to make it clear that neither the U.S. government nor JP Morgan are charitable societies," he said. "If they come to Argentina, it is for nothing other than to take a profit."</p>
<p>With Milei's efforts to deregulate the economy and scrap tariffs winning over Argentina's powerful agriculture sector, La Libertad Avanza also swept Santa Fe, which dominates soybean production and processing, and Córdoba, another powerhouse farming province.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Risks remain for Milei as austerity hits hard</h3> <p>Despite Milei's new momentum, experts caution that the irascible president still needs to court political allies to see through his agenda. Given the limited number of seats up for grabs in this election, it was mathematically impossible for Milei to secure a majority in either house.</p> <p>"This victory is necessary, but not sufficient to maintain control of Congress," said political consultant Sergio Berensztein. "The government must build a broad and effective coalition with like-minded forces."</p> <p>Seeking to capitalize quickly on Sunday's results, Milei said he called the country's powerful provincial governors to accelerate agreements on long-term economic reform.</p> <p>Sunday's outcome will also test public patience for Milei's cost-cutting measures in the coming months. Although Milei's budget cuts have significantly driven down inflation — from an annual high of 289% in April 2024 to 32% last month — the price increases still outpace salaries and pensions.</p> <p>The electorate appears increasingly polarized between beneficiaries of Milei's reforms and those who say they're struggling to make ends meet like never before.</p> <p>In the financial district of Puerto Madero, luxury car dealerships report sales surging since Milei scrapped import restrictions. Streets bustle with bankers who praise the president for ending a yearslong ban on selling dollars online. Fine restaurants serve Argentine oil executives who gush about his efforts to draw foreign investment.</p> <p>But at a soup kitchen on the other side of Argentina's Riachuelo River, Epifanía Contreras, 64, said she feels like she's bearing the brunt of the cutbacks.</p> <p>"You can't live on 290,000 pesos a month with today's inflation," she said, describing how her $200 monthly pension has shriveled in value since Milei cut cost-of-living increases. "The situation is getting worse and worse."</p>
<p>Reflecting widespread public resignation, electoral authorities reported a turnout rate of just under 68% Sunday, among the lowest recorded since the nation's 1983 return to democracy. Voting is compulsory in Argentina.</p> <p>"I vote out of obligation, nothing more," said Matías Paredes, 50, a real estate broker whose foreign clientele vanished with Milei's strong exchange rate. "None of these figures inspire optimism. We're just choosing the lesser evil."<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">California euthanizes 4 gray wolves after 'unprecedented' surge in livestock kills</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>After being wiped out in California for nearly a century, the gray wolf has been making a comeback in the state, in a change that's been celebrated by conservationists and wildlife lovers. But as their population has grown over the last decade, so too has the number of conflicts between wolves and ranchers.</p> <p>It's a pattern that's played out in other states, where wolf populations have rebounded in recent years.</p> <p>The latest example comes from Northern California, where state wildlife officials announced on Friday that they made the difficult decision to euthanize four wolves following an "unprecedented level" of attacks on livestock.</p>
<p>Between late March and early September, the gray wolves from the Beyem Seyo pack — one of 10 wolf packs now confirmed in California — were responsible for 70 total livestock losses, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) said. The losses represented nearly two-thirds of the state's total wolf-caused livestock depredations during that time period, according to the agency.</p> <p>"This decision was not made lightly nor was it easy," said CDFW director Charlton Bonham in a statement. "Despite extensive non-lethal efforts … these wolves continued to prey on livestock."</p> <p>Wildlife officials can<strong> </strong>use a variety of non-lethal tools to try to deter predators like wolves from attacking livestock, including firing guns into the air, hanging brightly colored flagging around grazing areas, and driving around herds with ATVs and trucks.</p> <p>Despite those efforts, the wolves had become so reliant on cattle as a food source that "we could not break the cycle," Bonham said. "Which ultimately is not good for the long-term recovery of wolves or for people."</p> <p>Gray wolves were largely hunted, trapped and poisoned out of the lower 48 U.S. states by the early 20th century. It's believed the last wolves in California were extirpated by the 1920s. Wolves have since returned to the state on their own, dispersing from packs in Oregon and spreading as far south as the southern end of the Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>In other parts of the country, most recently in Colorado and most notably in Yellowstone National Park, gray wolves have been reintroduced by wildlife officials in an effort to restore the areas' natural ecosystems.</p> <p>The reintroductions and recolonizations have followed a similar pattern: conservationists celebrating the return of the apex predator, while ranchers in largely rural areas criticize their impact<strong> </strong>on their livelihoods.</p> <p>In 2020, during the first Trump administration, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed gray wolves from the Endangered Species Act in the lower 48 states, citing increases in wolf populations in parts of the Western U.S. and the Upper Midwest — a move that ended federal protections for the species. Environmental groups sued over the decision, and a judge ordered protections reinstated in 2022.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>German police say they've broken up an international art forgery ring that tried to sell works purportedly by Pablo Picasso, Rembrandt, Frida Kahlo and others for tens of millions of dollars to unsuspecting collectors.</p> <p>The scheme was allegedly led by a 77-year-old German man from Bavaria with the help of ten accomplices, according to a press release from the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office.</p>
<p>Investigators say they discovered the fraud when the main suspect tried to sell two supposedly original Picasso works, including a portrait of the Spanish painter's muse Dora Maar. (A Picasso painting of Maar entitled <em>Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat</em> sold last week for around $37 million, after having been held in a family collection since it was purchased in 1944.)</p>
<p>The unnamed ringleader apparently also tried to sell a copy of a world-famous painting by the Dutch painter Rembrandt van Rijn known as <em>The Syndics</em>, a 17th century portrait of members of Amsterdam's cloth makers' guild, for roughly $150 million. But the original of that painting, known in Dutch as <em>De Staalmeesters</em>, sits in the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.</p> <p>Police say the fake was likely a copy from the 20th century owned by an 84-year-old Swiss woman, who is now also under investigation by German and Swiss authorities.</p>
<p>Other phony works allegedly offered for sale by the 77-year-old suspect included ceramic vases by Picasso, <em>Study of a Head</em> by Amadeo Modigliani, and pieces purportedly by Peter Paul Rubens, Joan Miró and Anthony van Dyck. Purchase prices ranged from about $460,000 to more than $16 million.</p> <p>One accomplice in the scheme was a 74-year-old man from Rhineland-Palatinate who produced counterfeit expert reports attesting to the authenticity of the forgeries, investigators say.</p> <p>A coordinated series of searches by police one morning earlier this month at more than a dozen locations in Germany, Switzerland and Lichtenstein yielded a number of suspected forgeries, which are set to be analyzed by art experts in the coming weeks.</p>

<div class="article-title">US and China say trade deal drawing closer as Trump and Xi prepare for meeting</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — A trade deal between the United States and China is drawing closer, officials from the world's two largest economies said Sunday as they reached an initial consensus for President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to aim to finalize during their high-stakes meeting.</p> <p>Any agreement would be a relief to international markets even it does not address underlying issues involving manufacturing imbalances and access to state-of-the-art computer chips.</p>
<p>Beijing recently limited exports of rare earth elements that are needed for advanced technologies, and Trump responded by threatening additional tariffs on Chinese products. The prospect of a widening conflict risked weakening economic growth worldwide.</p> <p>China's top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, told reporters that the two sides had reached a "preliminary consensus," while Trump's treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said there was "a very successful framework."</p> <p>Trump also expressed confidence that an agreement was at hand, saying the Chinese "want to make a deal and we want to make a deal." The Republican president is set to meet with Xi on Thursday in South Korea, the final stop of his trip through Asia. Trump reiterated that he plans to visit China in the future and suggested that Xi could come to Washington or Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private club in Florida.</p>
<p>Bessent told CBS' "Face the Nation" that the threat of additional higher tariffs on China was "effectively off the table." In interviews on several American news shows, he said discussions with China yielded initial agreements to stop the precursor chemicals for fentanyl from coming into the U.S., and that Beijing would make "substantial" purchases of soybean and other agricultural products while putting off export controls on rare earths.</p> <p>The progress toward a potential agreement came during the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, in Kuala Lumpur, with Trump seeking to burnish his reputation as an international dealmaker.</p> <p>Yet his way of pursuing deals has meant serious disruptions at home and abroad. His import taxes have scrambled relationships with trading partners while a U.S. government shutdown has him feuding with Democrats.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Trump attends ceasefire ceremony between Thailand and Cambodia</h3> <p>At the summit, Thailand and Cambodia signed an expanded ceasefire agreement during a ceremony attended by Trump. His threats of economic pressure prodded the two nations to halt skirmishes along their disputed border earlier this year.</p> <p>Thailand will release Cambodian prisoners and Cambodia will begin withdrawing heavy artillery as part of the first phase of the deal. Regional observers will monitor the situation to ensure fighting doesn't restart.</p>
<p>"We did something that a lot of people said couldn't be done," Trump said. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet called it a "historic day," and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the agreement creates "the building blocks for a lasting peace."</p> <p>The president signed economic frameworks with Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia, some of them aimed at increasing trade involving critical minerals. The United States wants to rely less on China, which has used limited on exports of key components in technology manufacturing as a bargaining chip in trade talks.</p>
<p>"It's very important that we cooperate as willing partners with each other to ensure that we can have smooth supply chains, secure supply chains, for the quality of life, for our people and security," U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Why the ACA needs young people — and the looming 'death spiral' for health insurance</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Chloe Chalakani has a lot at stake in the health care fight at the heart of the government shutdown.</p> <p>Chalakani runs a small culinary business with her partner in the coastal town of Thomaston, Maine. As temperatures drop and the height of her busy tourist season winds down, she's hitting her list of fall administrative tasks, including health insurance enrollment. She uses CoverME.gov, the Affordable Care Act marketplace in Maine, also known as Obamacare.</p> <p>Her options for 2026 are looking grim.</p> <p>"My premium is already $460 a month, and that is for the highest deductible plan that exists," she says. She's 31 years old and fairly healthy. Extra financial help with premiums — in the form of enhanced tax credits — expires in December, and rates are going up.</p>
<p>"I don't plan to get insurance next year," she says. "I'm just not going to do it — I'll pay out of pocket."</p>
<p>The prospect of young people dropping out of the ACA markets worries health policy experts — not just because of their own personal risk of going uninsured, but because of the effect that millions of people making the same decision could have on the whole health system.</p> <h3 class="edTag">How insurance works</h3> <p>Health insurance markets only function when there are lots of people pooling their resources — young and old, relatively healthy and not.</p> <p>"You need people to be paying into the insurance system when they're healthy so that they can take out when they're sick," explains Cynthia Cox of KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization.</p> <p>Younger, healthier people tend to pay more into the system than they consume in health care. Older, sicker people often consume an amount of health care that costs more than the amount they pay in. That dynamic creates a stable insurance system.</p> <p>Right now, the Affordable Care Act markets seem to be pretty balanced. A record 24 million people are enrolled, and brokers report their clients are generally happy with their plan options and find the premiums affordable.</p>
<p>That may be about to change. Premium costs will soon explode for many consumers because of the expiration of certain federal subsidies that kept those monthly costs low. It's the issue at the heart of the current federal shutdown — Democrats want the subsidies to be extended, Republicans say those negotiations shouldn't be part of the government funding debate.</p> <h3 class="edTag">The dreaded 'death spiral'</h3> <p>If Congress does not extend the federal subsidies set to expire in December, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that 4 million people will become uninsured in the next several years.</p> <p>The people who opt to go without insurance will probably be younger and healthier, Cox says, "because sicker, older people will be more motivated to keep their coverage, even if that means paying a lot more each month."</p> <p>It's easy to find people who fit these profiles. Chalakani, the 31-year-old in Maine plans to skip coverage, while a 64-year-old in West Virginia who needs expensive medications tells NPR she's saving up money now to pay $2,800 every month for her coverage next year.</p>
<p>"If you only have sick people buying health insurance plans, then the average cost of that plan is going to be very high," Cox says. "The concern is that the least sick person in that group is going to drop their coverage because it becomes unaffordable, and then the next year, the least sick person in <em>that </em>group might drop <em>their </em>coverage because it becomes unaffordable and on and on."</p> <p>This is what's called a death spiral for an insurance market, she explains. "Premiums get so high that only the sickest of the sickest people are enrolled, and eventually insurance companies just are not going to want to participate in a market like that — it's just not going to function."</p> <p>Although it is a relatively small portion of Americans who buy these plans, it has the potential to hurt everyone, regardless of how they're insured. If more people in the country become uninsured, that's hard on hospitals and health care access.</p>
<p>"If hospitals face a lot of financial strain from having a lot more uninsured patients coming through their doors, then they might start changing the services they offer," she says. "They may have to close the maternity ward. They might have to close down altogether."</p>
<p>That's already starting to happen in Maine and other parts of the country, where health care markets are under financial pressure. And that pressure is increasing with looming cuts to Medicaid from President Trump's budget law that are expected to increase the number of uninsured people by millions more.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Open enrollment is Nov. 1</h3> <p>Weeks into the shutdown, federal lawmakers have apparently not started negotiations to overcome the stalemate. The two sides have been at an impasse since Oct. 1.</p> <p>Meanwhile, open enrollment is coming on Nov. 1 — in Idaho, it's already begun. Unless Congress acts quickly, enrollees will likely have sticker shock when they log in to find a plan for 2026. On average, consumers will have to pay double next year for the same plan.</p>
<p>Chloe Chalakani says she plans to go uninsured even though she knows that car accidents and serious illnesses can happen. "Should a catastrophe happen, I'll probably say, 'Wow, I should have had insurance,'" she says. "But at this point, I don't have the financial ability to plan for that."</p> <p>If lawmakers do overcome the impasse and extend the enhanced subsidies so her premiums stay about the same, she says she might reconsider her plan to go without health insurance in 2026.<br/></p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Suspects have been arrested in the theft of crown jewels from the Louvre museum in Paris, with one apprehended at Charles de Gaulle Airport Saturday night, according to the Paris prosecutor.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau confirmed the arrests. She also condemned the leak of information in the case, which she said had forced the authorities to reveal facts prematurely, and which she claimed could hinder the work of over 100 investigators who have been "mobilized to recover the stolen jewels and apprehend all of the perpetrators".</p> <p>The brazen daytime heist at the museum last Sunday stunned France, when four men, dressed as workmen, broke in through an upper floor window using a ladder on a moving truck. They cut into glass cases with an electric saw and made off with over $100 million worth of royal jewels from the 19th Century reign of Emperor Napoleon III.</p>
<p>According to Le Parisien newspaper, the men arrested are from the Paris suburbs. One was preparing to board a flight from Charles de Gaulle Airport with some of the stolen items from the Louvre. Another suspect was arrested later in the evening in the Seine-Saint-Denis suburb north of Paris.</p> <p>French Interior minister Laurent Nunez praised "the investigators who have worked tirelessly, just as I asked them to, and who have always had my full confidence."</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>

<p>LINCOLN UNIVERSITY, Pa.  — One person was killed and six more were wounded in a shooting Saturday night at Pennsylvania's Lincoln University, where gunfire erupted during outdoor festivities as students and alumni celebrated homecoming at the historically Black school.</p> <p>A person who had a firearm was detained, and officials are investigating the possibility that there was more than one shooter but don't believe there is any active threat to the campus, Chester County District Attorney Christopher de Barrena-Sarobe said during a brief news conference early Sunday.</p> <p>"We don't have a lot of answers about exactly what happened," he said. "What I will tell you is that today we're operating as if this is not an incident where someone came in with the design to inflict mass damage on a college campus."</p>
<p>The campus is about 45 miles (70 kilometers) southwest of Philadelphia.</p> <p>Authorities say the gunfire erupted around 9:30 p.m. outside a large building called the International Cultural Center, where tents and tables were set up for tailgating and socializing after a football game earlier in the day.</p> <p>"It was a chaotic scene, and people fled in every direction," the district attorney said. He urged anyone with video from the scene or other information that could help the investigation to contact the FBI.</p> <p>Authorities weren't sharing details about the victims, including their conditions or where the injured were being treated.</p> <p>Chester County detectives are leading the investigation, with support from state police and the FBI.</p> <p>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said on X that he was briefed on the shooting and offered his administration's support.</p> <p>"Join Lori and me in praying for the Lincoln University community," he said.</p> <p>Lincoln University Police Chief Marc Partee said the shooting devastated the university community on what was supposed to be a joyous day celebrating the school's legacy.</p> <p>"If there was another word to describe that, that's more impactful, I would use it," he said, "but 'devastated' is a start."</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump attends ceasefire ceremony with Thailand and Cambodia during Malaysia visit</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Thailand and Cambodia signed an expanded ceasefire agreement on Sunday during a ceremony attended by U.S. President Donald Trump, whose threats of economic pressure prodded the two nations to halt skirmishes along their disputed border earlier this year.</p>
<p>Thailand will release Cambodian prisoners and Cambodia will begin withdrawing heavy artillery as part of the first phase of the deal. Regional observers will monitor the situation to ensure fighting doesn't restart.</p> <p>"We did something that a lot of people said couldn't be done," Trump said. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet called it a "historic day," and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the agreement creates "the building blocks for a lasting peace."</p> <p>The ceremony was Trump's first event after arriving at the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, hosted in Kuala Lumpur. The trip, which will continue with visits to Japan and South Korea and a potential meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, is an opportunity for Trump to burnish his reputation as an international dealmaker at a time when his tariffs have scrambled the international economy and he's feuding with Democrats over a government shutdown back home.</p>
<p>Trump touched down in the Malaysian capital shortly before 0200 GMT, where he performed his trademark campaign trail dance with local performers and waved an American flag in one hand and a Malaysian flag in the other.</p>
<p>The president signed economic agreements with Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia, some of them aimed at increasing trade involving critical minerals. The U.S. wants to rely less on China, which has limited exports of key components in technology manufacturing.</p> <p>"It's very important that we cooperate as willing partners with each other to ensure that we can have smooth supply chains, secure supply chains, for the quality of life, for our people and security," said U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Trump reengages with a key region of the world</h3> <p>The president attended this summit only once during his first term, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seemed unfamiliar with ASEAN during his confirmation hearing in January.</p> <p>But this year's event was a chance for Trump to reengage with a collection of nations that has a combined $3.8 trillion economy and 680 million people.</p> <p>"The United States is with you 100%, and we intend to be a strong partner and friend for many generations to come," Trump said. He described his counterparts as "spectacular leaders" and said, "everything you touch turns to gold."</p>
<p>The summit also allowed Trump to play global peacemaker with Thailand and Cambodia, which have competing territorial claims that result in periodic violence along their border. Some of the worst modern fighting between the two countries took place over five days in July, killing dozens and displacing hundreds of thousands of people, some of the worst modern fighting between the two countries.</p> <p>Trump threatened, at the time, to withhold trade agreements unless the fighting stopped in a display of economic leverage credited with spurring negotiations. A shaky truce has persisted since then.</p> <p>"The fact that Trump was holding the tariff card was actually very, very significant," said Ou Virak, president of Phnom Penh's Future Forum think tank. "That's probably the main reason, if not the only reason, but definitely the main reason why the two sides agreed immediately to the ceasefire."</p> <p>Now, he said, "there's a ceremony for Trump to be in front of cameras" so he can be "seen as the champion that brings an end to wars and conflicts," giving him "more ammunition for his bid for Nobel Peace Prize."</p> <p>Trump has explicitly campaigned for the honor, continuously adding to a list of conflicts that he either helped resolve or claims to have ended.</p>
<p>Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim praised the agreement between Thailand and Cambodia during opening remarks at the summit, saying, "it reminds us that reconciliation is not concession, but an act of courage."</p> <p>Thai foreign ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura described the deal on Saturday as a "joint declaration" that will show Thailand and Cambodia "are committed to renewing their relations."</p> <p>"It's not an end in itself," Nikorndej said. "Work has just begun."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Tariffs are in focus on Trump's trip</h3> <p>Trump is expected to sit down with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva while he's in Kuala Lumpur, but not Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The U.S. leader is angry with Canada because of a television ad protesting his tariffs, and on his way to the summit, announced on social media he would hike tariffs on Canada because of it.</p>
<p>Another trade war is front and center on Trump's trip — this one, with China. Trump told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One that he was optimistic his meeting with Xi, expected to take place in South Korea, could yield progress on a range of issues. Fentanyl trafficking and soybean sales are among Trump's priorities.</p> <p>"I think we have a really good chance of making a very comprehensive deal," Trump said. "I want our farmers to be taken care of. And he wants things also."</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether Trump's dealmaking addresses longstanding issues or puts them off for another day.</p> <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested Sunday that Washington and Beijing could step back from their confrontation instead of pushing forward with higher tariffs by America and export restrictions on rare earth elements by China.</p> <p>When asked if the two countries could extend the trade truce from earlier this year, Bessent said: "I would say yes." However, he emphasized that the final decision would be up to Trump.</p> <p>Trump has expressed confidence about the prospect of finalizing trade agreements with Japan and South Korea, two longstanding allies and trading partners, during the trip.</p> <p>"We have deals with a lot of people and they're very good deals," he told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One.</p> <p>One leader who was absent from the summit in Kuala Lumpur is Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Although he was close with Trump during his first term, the relationship has been more tense lately. Trump caused irritation by boasting that he settled a recent conflict between India and Pakistan, and he has increased tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil.</p>
