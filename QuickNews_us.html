<div class="article-title">New York’s Stop-Mamdani movement may fall short for Andrew Cuomo despite Eric Adams endorsement</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>There was Andrew Cuomo, at Madison Square Garden, yukking it up at a Knicks game.</p><p>What was the ousted governor so happy about? He’d just come from the final New York mayoral debate, where he landed some blows against front-runner Zohran Mamdani, but he’s still on track to lose the election.</p><p>Ah, but the appearance at an NBA game (the league suddenly tainted by a gambling scandal that includes the Mafia!) – was a photo op, with Mayor Eric Adams, who endorsed his onetime rival yesterday.</p><p>So what if he called Cuomo "a snake and a liar" last month?</p><p>Yet Adams, who had been indicted on corruption charges–until the Trump Justice Department dropped the case–was down in the single digits. So his backing may not move many votes, though it could give Cuomo some street cred in the Black community and among Orthodox Jews.</p><p>New York City politics is a game of nine-dimensional chess, with shifting alliances, red-hot rivalries and clashing narratives. Speaking as a native, you’ve got to understand the melting pot, the boroughs, the ethnic neighborhoods, Wall Street, Albany–it’s an asphalt jungle. </p><p>New York mayors tend to become national figures–John Lindsay, Ed Koch, Rudy Giuliani, Michael Bloomberg–by reigning in the media capital.</p><p>You think it’s a coincidence that Donald Trump, Andrew Cuomo, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer are all from New York? C’mon! Whatsa madder wid you?  </p><p>Mamdani, an assemblyman who started out at 1 percent, should have been clobbered by Cuomo, who ran a lazy, entitled effort and lost the Democratic nomination.</p><p>From Harlem to Coney Island, Mamdani proved to be a charismatic campaigner. He will likely win even if the Republican, Curtis Sliwa, formerly of the Guardian Angels, drops out, which he has no incentive to do.</p><p>So the race has morphed into a Stop-Mamdani movement, mainly because he is a self-described democratic socialist who in the past has taken some far-left stances, such as defunding the police. Republicans would love to make him a national symbol of the party; Trump regularly denounces him as a "communist." Yet even many Democrats worry about him driving business out of the Apple.</p><p>Cuomo, as the son of a governor, inevitably seems the establishment candidate. And Andrew, who I’ve known since he was 25, before he ran HUD, has the baggage of being forced to resign over allegations of sexual harassment by 13 women–with Mamdani announcing that one of them, Charlotte Bennett, was in the debate audience. </p><p>Cuomo, off balance, said no charges had ever been filed. Trump, by the way, pulled the same move in a debate with Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Andrew Cuomo was also blamed for nursing home deaths during the pandemic. </p><p>The New York Times has seven "takeaways," such as Cuomo having "more energy" and landing "more blows" against Mamdani: "He’s never run anything, managed anything; he’s never had a real job."</p><p>In a classic New York putdown, the ex-governor said Trump would roll right over Mamdani: "He thinks he’s a kid and he’s going to knock him on his tuchus." (You can look it up. Mayor Koch once called someone a "schmuck" and there was a whole editors’ debate over whether I could print that.)</p><p>Mamdani countered that Cuomo would merely be "Trump’s puppet."</p><p>If you’re getting the impression that the president is pretty unpopular in his home city, now abandoned for Palm Beach, you’re right. </p><p>Both rivals hit Mamdani on Israel, with Sliwa saying his two young sons, who are Jewish, feel unsafe.</p><p>That is one of the key points in the Washington Post, which clocks in at five "takeaways."</p><p>"He does not think the country should exist as a majority-Jewish state and should instead focus on equal rights for both Palestinians and Jews. In this debate, the attacks on Mamdani, who is Muslim, seemed to land harder, even as Mamdani insisted he would fight anti-Semitism."</p><p>Which brings us to a far more personal assault from Times columnist Bret Stephens, under the headline "Why Mamdani Scares Jews Like Me."</p><p>He invokes some lesser-known stances from the past.</p><p>One, when Mamdani founded the Bowdoin College chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, he stopped cooperating with the left-wing Jewish group J Street, which backs Palestinian statehood and opposes Israeli settlements</p><p>"Why? Because J Street supports Israel as ‘a democratic homeland for the Jewish people.’ This was too much for Mamdani…who to this day does not support Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state."</p><p>Two, Mamdani wrote a rap song in 2017 declaring love for "the Holy Land Five…The Holy Land Foundation was an ostensible charity convicted in 2008 of funneling $12 million to Hamas," with the defendants convicted of terrorism and other crimes.</p><p>Three, a few months before the Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas, Mamdani introduced a bill "that could have jeopardized the tax-exempt status of virtually every pro-Israel charity." Stephens accuses the front-runner of "monomania."</p><p>This is no small matter in a city with the world’s largest Jewish population outside Israel. But Mamdani has met with rabbis and some younger Jewish voters are backing him, either because they’re focused on his affordability campaign or oppose the damage and death toll that Israel has inflicted on Gaza. </p><p>And get this: Cuomo just pulled down an AI ad showing Mamdani supporters as looters, drunk drivers as human traffickers. "Just disgusting," said Zohran.</p><p>So that about wraps this piece up, right?</p><p>Sit down! There’s always more drama in the city that never sleeps.</p><p>Curtis Sliwa suddenly quit his job at New York’s top talk radio station, WABC (a rock station back in my day).</p><p>"You will never see me at the studios of WABC again!" he thundered.</p><p>Sliwa said people that he hired and trained were betraying him by urging him to quit in order to stop Mamdani. </p><p>Billionaire John Catsimatidis, the station owner, who ran for mayor himself a decade ago, has also suggested he bow out.</p><p>Sliwa told host Sid Rosenberg that WABC is biased toward Cuomo. "You’re gonna lose and you’re gonna lose badly, embarrassingly," Rosenberg said as their shouting match grew louder.</p><p>I have no idea why Curtis Sliwa would give up the gig. But as the politicians know, New York is an outta-my-way, horn-honking place where everyone takes turns being mad at each other. </p><p>Start spreadin’ the news…</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The FBI is investigating after a vehicle carrying two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers was allegedly rammed by a driver in another vehicle during an attempted Arizona traffic stop Thursday morning, officials said.</p><p>The incident began around 8 a.m. local time, when ICE agents tried to stop a vehicle in the Avondale area, according to FOX 10 Phoenix.</p><p>Authorities allege that the driver refused to pull over and instead fled the scene, the outlet reported.</p><p>The suspect then reportedly returned to a residence in his vehicle, where he rammed it into an ICE vehicle occupied by the two officers. </p><p>In a statement, FBI officials confirmed they are leading the investigation into the incident and will refer their findings to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona for a charging decision. </p><p>"The results will be turned over to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, District of Arizona for a charging decision," the statement read.</p><p>Officials have not yet disclosed the identity of the driver involved, whether any arrests have been made, or if any injuries were reported. </p><p>Avondale Police Department confirmed to Fox News Digital the incident was deferred to the FBI.</p><p>In another ramming incident, three federal officers were also said to be injured Thursday in San Diego after a man, who ICE said was in the country illegally, allegedly rammed his vehicle to avoid arrest, per reports.</p><p>One witness, Michael Burreec, told ABC San Diego affiliate KGTV that the driver showed "blatant disregard for human life and the rule of the law is exactly why ICE San Diego will continue to pursue, arrest and remove dangerous illegal aliens who threaten our communities."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Grassley releases memo showing DOJ 'unleashed unchecked government power' on Trump associates</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, on Thursday released an April 2022 Justice Department memo showing then-Attorney General Merrick Garland, then-Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, and then-FBI Director Christopher Wray personally approved an FBI investigation into alleged efforts by Trump campaign associates to obstruct Congress’ certification of the 2020 election.</p><p>Grassley posted the four-page memorandum on X, saying it proves top Biden administration officials "personally approved" the case — which he referred to as "Arctic Frost" — and that it "unleashed unchecked government power at the highest levels."</p><p>The Iowa Republican added, "My oversight will continue."</p><p>The April 2022 memo, signed by Garland, Monaco, and Wray, authorized the FBI’s Washington Field Office to open what the bureau designated a "Sensitive Investigative Matter." The document details the FBI’s request to examine whether individuals connected to Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign conspired to obstruct Congress’ certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6, 2021.</p><p>"Following the 2020 Presidential and Vice Presidential election, in an apparent effort to obstruct Congress’s certification of Electoral College, fraudulent certificates of electors’ votes were submitted to the Archivist of the United States, purporting to represent the actual elector votes from the states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin," the executive summary reads. "Open source reporting and public statements made by individuals closely associated with Donald J. Trump, Inc. (Trump Campaign) present an articulable factual basis indicating the existence of a federal crime, and thus the FBI seeks to open a full investigation.</p><p>"Because this investigation involves a SIM as set forth in the Department of Justice memorandum dated February 5, 2020, entitled ‘Additional Requirements for Opening of Certain Sensitive Investigations’ (DOJ Memo), your authorization is required before WFO may initiate this full investigation," the document continued.</p><p>Monaco wrote at the bottom of the document, "Merrick- I recommend you approve," before initialing and dating it 4/5/22. Garland ultimately signed off on the investigation on the same day.</p><p>The authorization came more than a year after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and months before now-former Special Counsel Jack Smith was appointed to oversee related investigations. The memo appears to document an early stage of the Justice Department’s examination of the so-called "fake electors" effort that became a focus of Smith’s probe.</p><p>In 2023, Smith subpoenaed phone records belonging to eight Republican senators and one House member, covering a four-day period — Jan. 4 to Jan. 7, 2021 — to examine call activity around the Capitol riot. The subpoenas did not seek call content but instead listed numbers, dates and durations.</p><p>The targeted senators included Republican Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.</p><p>In addition to the eight senators, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News' Sean Hannity Tuesday that he recently discovered Smith also attempted to subpoena his toll records but that his phone company, AT&amp;T, did not hand them over.</p><p>Smith said the records were narrowly tailored and "entirely proper," adding they were meant to support his investigation into Trump’s alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 election results.</p><p>His lawyers wrote to Grassley, saying the subpoenas complied with Justice Department policy and were routine.</p><p>Republicans have broadly claimed they were inappropriately spied on and compared Arctic Frost to the Watergate scandal. Smith’s lawyers emphasized the normalcy of seeking phone records and said public officials are not immune from investigation.</p><p>Smith’s attorneys also disputed accusations from FBI Director Kash Patel that the subpoenas were hidden, noting the requests were referenced in a footnote of Smith’s final report and shared with Trump’s defense team in discovery.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Ashley Oliver contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Susan Boyle, who became an international sensation in 2009 when she shocked the judges with her powerful rendition of "I Dreamed a Dream" from "Les Misérables," showed off her new blonde locks on a red carpet this week.</p><p>The 64-year-old sported a bob with bangs while attending the Pride of Britain Awards in London on Monday.</p><p>"What a wonderful evening at the Pride of Britain Awards! It was such an honour to celebrate so many truly inspiring people," Boyle wrote on her Instagram. "Everyone looked absolutely fabulous, and it was lovely to catch up with some familiar faces, including the brilliant Anne Hegerty (I’m a huge fan of The Chase)!"</p><p>She added, "A night full of pride, joy and admiration for some incredible heroes."</p><p>The star also included multiple photos of herself on the red carpet.</p><p>Her Instagram post was flooded with praise for her new look.</p><p>"Looking absolutely gorgeous… and such a beautiful outfit," one person wrote, while another added, "U look fantastic, Susan."</p><p>A third follower called her "beautiful," adding, "Your hair it really suits you xx."</p><p>Boyle’s outfit was equally as glamorous as her new hairdo.</p><p>She wore a black-and-white floral-patterned long-sleeve dress, pairing it with a faux-fur black wrap, shoes, clutch, and pearls.</p><p>Boyle returned to social media in April after a two-year hiatus, saying she was working on some new projects.</p><p>In 2023, she joined the West End cast of "Les Misérables," telling them that she had suffered a stroke the year before.</p><p>"It’s extra special for me, actually, because last April there, I suffered a minor stroke," she said after her performance, according to the Huffington Post.

<div class="article-title">Illegal immigrant truck driver in fatal California crash should never have had license: DOT report</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump’s transportation secretary Sean P. Duffy issued a bombshell report Thursday night accusing California of violating federal law by issuing a commercial driver’s license to a foreign asylum seeker whose semi-truck crash killed three people earlier this week.</p><p>The report alleges that Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration ignored a federal order to halt noncompliant licenses and revoke improperly issued credentials, a failure that, according to Duffy, cost "three innocent souls."</p><p>Federal regulators uncovered flaws in how California licenses certain commercial truck drivers. The 2025 Annual Program Review and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) concluded that the state’s commercial driver’s license (CDL) system suffered from "systemic policy, procedural, and programming errors" when it came to handling non-domiciled licenses.</p><p>In an audit letter dated Sept. 26, 2025, investigators also discovered that California had issued CDLs to non-domiciled drivers that were valid even after their federal work authorization expired.</p><p>That same day, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued an emergency interim final rule that tightened standards for non-domiciled CDLs nationwide. In the rule, stipulations changed and limited eligibility to applicants holding certain employment-based visas. It requires every state to verify their legal status through the SAVE (Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements) database.</p><p>California also allegedly violated federal law by upgrading the non-domiciled commercial driver's license (CDL) of the Indian national tied to the fatal crash, Jashanpreet Singh, despite a federal emergency rule and compliance notice issued Sept. 26.</p><p>"My prayers are with the families of the victims of this tragedy. It would have never happened if Gavin Newsom had followed our new rules. California broke the law and now three people are dead and two are hospitalized. These people deserve justice. There will be consequences," said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy.</p><p>California issued the CDL to Singh on June 27, according to federal records. A Department of Transportation audit on Sept. 26 flagged "significant compliance failures" in the state’s licensing process, yet on Oct. 15, officials reportedly upgraded the driver’s license despite federal restrictions.</p><p>Under the new rule, any non-domiciled commercial learner’s permit or CDL must expire no later than the end date on the driver’s federal immigration record or after one year, whichever comes first. It also maintains that states must keep proof of their lawful presence on file for at least two years.</p><p>The FMCSA review revealed that this was a widespread problem. In California alone, more than one-fourth of all sampled non-domiciled CDLs were issued incorrectly, including drivers who were ineligible, whose legal presence had lapsed, or whose license expiration dates didn’t match their immigration documents.</p><p>This resulted in the DOT ordering California to halt all new non-domiciled CDL issuances, review existing licenses for compliance and either revoke or reissue them if they didn't meet federal standards. The state was told they had 30 days to comply or risk losing up to $160 million in federal highway funding.</p><p>Just six days later, on Oct. 21, the license holder was behind the wheel of a semi-truck involved in a fatal freeway crash that killed three people.</p><p>The Department of Transportation has given California 30 days to identify and revoke all noncompliant licenses or risk federal funding penalties.</p><p>Duffy framed the issue as part of a larger national safety crisis and even noted that multiple fatal crashes had been involved with drivers holding improperly issued non-domiciled CDLs.</p><p>The California DMV did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">FBI Director Kash Patel warns illegal gambling sting is 'just the start' in nationwide takedown</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>FBI Director Kash Patel warned the "nationwide takedown" of an illegal gambling ring with alleged ties to famed basketball personalities and crime families is "just the start" on Fox News.</p><p>His interview followed the FBI’s arrest of the Portland Trail Blazers’ head coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier in connection with federal investigations into the alleged crime ring.</p><p>"If you break the law, we're coming for you," Patel told Fox News host Laura Ingraham.</p><p>Patel alleged that widespread fraud committed on the "grand stage" of basketball has been going on for "some time."</p><p>"It has nothing to do with legal gambling and has everything to do with those in positions of power in places like the NBA getting in bed with La Cosa Nostra and committing acts of extortion, fraud, money-laundering and wire fraud and so many other crimes," he said.</p><p>"Your winning streak has ended," U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Joseph Nocella said at a press conference. "Your luck has run out. Violating the law is a losing proposition, and you can bet on that."</p><p>Billups and Rozier were among more than 30 individuals arrested across 11 states as part of the coordinated operation, which includes charges of wire fraud, extortion and illegal gambling. Officials said the fraud, theft and robbery total tens of millions of dollars.</p><p>"These individuals got in bed with La Cosa Nostra and four of the five major crime families in New York City to create gambling empires, to rob people of their money, to extort people, to commit acts of wire fraud, to rig games and poker games and basketball games, just so they can make a few extra bucks," Patel said on "The Ingraham Angle." "They had the protection of the mafia in New York, around this country, so that they could continue this scheme to fleece innocent victims of tens of millions of dollars."</p><p>Patel noted the gambling ring’s alleged ties to the La Cosa Nostra and Gambino crime families. Members allegedly defrauded millions of victims, laundered proceeds through cryptocurrency and rigged poker games with cheating devices.</p><p>"They literally had scanners at the poker tables, where they literally had professional athletes in the NBA walk off the court so their proposition bets could be met," Patel said.</p><p>The NBA has since put Billups and Rozier on immediate leaves of absence, Fox News Digital reported.</p><p>"Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups are being placed on immediate leave from their teams, and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities," the league stated. "We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority."</p><p>ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith weighed in on the controversy.</p><p>"… when you've got all of these protesters that have been going out there and people who have been protesting against him and what have you, this man is coming. He’s coming, and I’ve been saying it for a long time. To me, this is the latest nugget of evidence that we’re talking about right here. That's not to question the legitimacy of the case," he said.</p><p>Patel responded, saying Smith’s remarks might be "the single dumbest thing I've ever heard out of anyone in modern history."</p><p>The FBI director maintained the investigation is far from over and said the cornerstone of his leadership is "follow the money."</p><p>"We are going to continue to work this investigation and those that have been arrested today to make sure that illegal gambling empires embedded with the La Cosa Nostra are brought down, whether they're in the NBA or anywhere else," he said. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Attorney General Pam Bondi put former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on notice Thursday night over her vow to "unmask" ICE agents.</p><p>During an interview on "Jesse Watters Primetime," Bondi reacted to a clip of Lightfoot talking about how she wants to create a real-time portal to track "purported criminal actions of ICE and CBP agents" and "unmask" them.</p><p>"This is the first time I’ve seen the Lori Lightfoot video was just now on your show," she told host Jesse Watters. "She will be getting a letter from us tomorrow to preserve anything she has done as well, to make sure that she’s not violating the law. It appears she is. You cannot disclose the identity of a federal agent — where they live, anything that could harm them."</p><p>Lightfoot made the comments on FOX32 Chicago’s "Chicago Report." She said she and other attorneys are creating a nonprofit called "The ICE Accountability Project."</p><p>Lightfoot said it would be a "centralized archive of all the purported criminal actions of ICE and CBP agents" that would spit out real-time updates to the public.</p><p>"We start the process of unmasking the agents," she said.

<div class="article-title">Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith clash over FBI gambling probe allegedly involving NBA figures: 'That's stupidity'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The biggest story in sports, let alone the NBA, was the FBI gambling probe that was announced on Thursday, which involved the arrests of Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA guard Damon Jones among many others. </p><p>During ESPN’s "Inside The NBA," the panel of Shaquille O’Neal, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Charles Barkley discussed the situation, but it resulted in a bit of a heated back and forth between Smith and Barkley. </p><p>Smith began with his lengthy take on the situation. </p><p>"We look at players who are involved and people who are involved, we’re surprised when you have access and you’re at the top of the game, so to speak as a coach or a player or whatever at the top of the game, you have access to millions of dollars in this league. So, it was surprising that they put themselves in that position possibly. Innocent until proven guilty," he said.</p><p>Smith’s next point is what ticked off Barkley, who was visibly frustrated at the desk.</p><p>"I think the other part is you have to realize gambling is an addiction, so the addiction of it is what makes you make illogical decisions," Smith continued. "… The FBI Director [Kash Patel] said, there’s a man who lost $1.8 million. That means he has a lot of money, so he has an addiction to that. Those ‘fish’ that they talked about bringing in. So, gambling is an addiction which could make you make illogical decisions regardless of your ethnic background, regardless of your physical background, regardless of your financial status. So, let’s understand that.</p><p>"I disagree in terms of the NBA dropping the ball. This is an ongoing investigation. There’s no way that any FBI, or police even, who anyone would say, ‘Hey, this is what we’re doing.’ The surprise element always makes it happen so they cannot overextend the information they’re receiving.</p><p>As Smith told Barkley he would let him talk once he made his final point, Barkley couldn’t hold back.</p><p>"I wish you would because you’re making me mad right here," Barkley said. </p><p>"I also think that because there’s people getting speeding tickets it doesn’t mean everyone in the league speeds. So, don’t look at this group of people that started to get investigated as the entire league," Smith concluded. </p><p>Then, it was Barkley’s turn to speak. </p><p>"First of all, these are two different things," he began. "Take Chauncey out of the equation, and the reason I’m mad at Kenny is this has nothing to do with a damn gambling addiction. This ain’t got nothing to do with addiction. These dudes are stupid. You can, under no circumstances, fix basketball games. Under no circumstances. I love to gamble. Rozier makes $26 million. Him giving people information or taking himself out of games, how much is he going to benefit taking himself out of games to hit unders? He’s making $26 million."</p><p>Smith butted in, as he said Barkley was proving his point. </p><p>"If you’re making $26 million to try to when $50,000, that’s illogical," Smith said.</p><p>Barkley fired back, reiterating his belief that those involved were not gambling addicts, but rather "that’s stupidity."</p><p>"The notion that guys are making all this money and giving information, stop that. That’s got nothing to do with addiction. It’s total stupidity on those two’s parts," Barkley said.</p><p>O’Neal gave his take prior to the Smith and Barkley debate. He said the league gave forums to inform players about the dangers of gambling.</p><p>"All these guys knew what was at stake and I’m just ashamed that they put themselves, put their family and put the NBA in this position," O’Neal said. "You all know the rules, we all know the letter of the law and it’s just unfortunate. Innocent until proven guilty, but usually when the FBI has something, they have you." </p><p>Billups, a Basketball Hall of Famer like the men on the panel, left an Oregon federal courthouse on Thursday, where he didn’t answer questions after being arrested as part of the FBI investigation. Billups was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, as he was allegedly involved in the rigged poker games investigation. </p><p>Billups was released from custody under the conditions of turning over his passport, not contacting any of the 30-plus co-defendants charged, and not participating in any gambling activity. </p><p>Rozier was allegedly involved in the sports gambling ring, where schemers were allegedly giving non-public information about who would be sitting out future games or when they would be pulling themselves out early for injuries or illnesses. </p><p>New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said Rozier faked an injury to leave a March 23, 2023, game between the Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans. Rozier was alleged to have told co-defendant Deniro Laster that he would take himself out of the game so Laster could bet on it.</p><p>The NBA cooperated with the investigation and placed Billups and Rozier on an immediate leave of absence. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">JB Pritzker accuses ICE of 'racial profiling,' defends comparing agents to Nazis</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker ridiculed President Donald Trump’s claim that ICE agents are going after the "worst of the worst" in their crackdown on illegal immigration in Illinois on Thursday.</p><p>"They’re literally going after Black and brown people because of the color of their skin," the governor told "Special Report."</p><p>Pritzker, who created theIllinois Accountability Commissionto track ICE agents' conduct, insisted there are instances of misconduct "all the time." The vocal Trump critic has compared the president’s ICE crackdown to Nazi Germany and called ICE agents Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s "thugs."</p><p>However, he told "Special Report" anchor Bret Baier his state will help law enforcement who have a judicial warrant to deport violent criminals.</p><p>"We want the bad guys off the streets," Pritzker said. "What we don't want is for people to get racially profiled. That's what's happening right now."</p><p>When Baier pressed Pritzker on his comparisons against ICE agents, the governor stood behind his comments.</p><p>"I’m talking about what they were doing, taking away people's rights, arresting people, asking them for papers," Pritzker said. </p><p>"Early on in an authoritarian regime, wherever it is in the world throughout history, this is what happens," he continued. "It's the beginning of something very bad for a country, especially a constitutional republic."</p><p>He went on to argue the only thing he is "demonizing" is when law enforcement is acting out of line and are "literally racial profiling."</p><p>Baier countered, "You don’t think you’re painting with a broad brush of all the ICE agents that are doing their job?" </p><p>The governor replied nobody in Washington is holding the "bad ones" accountable.</p><p>There literally haven't been any suspensions or firings for the terrible things that they've done, literally grabbing people, tackling them when they're U.S. Citizens and have done zero wrong," Pritzker argued.</p><p>The Democrat once again pointed to Trump's federal troops to reiterate his warning Thursday on ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith’s show that the president may try to steal the next election.</p><p>What I'm telling you is you can just look back in his own history, back to 2020, after the election, when he claimed fraud, he claimed it had been stolen from him," Pritzker recalled. "And he and Michael Flynn discussed, and Michael Flynn very publicly talked about, maybe we should use troops and go in and seize the ballot boxes and count the votes. </p><p>"You don't think Donald Trump heard that and thought maybe that's a good idea?" he asked.</p><p>Trump sending troops to blue cities is "not at all," about fighting crime, Pritzker claimed.</p><p>When Baier asked Pritzker what’s the best thing that Trump has done since being in office, the Democrat conceded the country no longer has the "problem" of illegal border crossings.</p><p>However, he argued Trump refuses to propose "comprehensive immigration reform" through Congress.</p><p>Why does he want to send troops in? Why does he want to send ICE and CBP in? Why not get immigration reform in place that we can all rally around?" he asked</p><p>It’s been 40 years since both parties "rallied" behind an immigration bill, Pritzker noted. </p><p>"Let's finally do it," he said.</p><p>Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Illinois will remain blocked indefinitely.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Trump administration proposed extending a U.S. District Court judge’s restraining order on the deployment of the National Guard while the Supreme Court weighs the case. It is unclear when the high court may rule on the issue after the administration’s emergency appeal last week to intervene.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Harvard University resident dean made a series of inflammatory social media posts over several years before his appointment, attacking police, White people and conservatives, in addition to defending threats against President Donald Trump, according to a new report.</p><p>The posts, unearthed by Yard Report and featured in <i>The Harvard Salient</i>, a student-run conservative journal, showed Gregory Davis, the Allston Burr Resident Dean at Harvard, repeatedly making comments critical of White people and law enforcement while defending rioting and looting.</p><p>Davis, who was previously a resident tutor and became a dean in 2024 according to his LinkedIn profile, posted on X in 2019, "It’s almost like Whiteness is a self-destructive ideology that annihilates everyone around it. By design." </p><p>In his role as Dunster House Allston Burr Resident Dean, Davis serves as a primary liaison for students seeking academic and wellness support.</p><p>In 2020, Davis wrote on X, formerly Twitter, "You should ask your cop friends to resign since they’re racist and evil," according to screenshots from the Sailent.</p><p>Another post from 2020 read, "Something to keep in mind: rioting and looting are parts of democracy just like voting and marching. The people WILL be heard." </p><p>At the time Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19 in 2020, he wrote he didn't blame "people wishing Trump ill." He later wrote "f--- that guy" and posted a Rocky IV gif of Ivan Drago saying, "If he dies, he dies."</p><p>A 2021 X post read, "Rush Limbaugh is dead. Just as important: the Smucker’s Natural was on sale at Safeway." </p><p>An Instagram post from June 8, 2024, just weeks before Davis said he assumed his role as dean in July 2024, read, "Wishing everyone a great Pride. Remember to love each other and hate the police." </p><p>On his official Harvard bio page, Davis describes himself as "a Black, queer, neurodivergent (ADHD), first-generation, public school graduate from Detroit." </p><p>He received his master's degree in psychology from Harvard in 2016 and a doctorate in philosophy and African-American/Black Studies in 2020. </p><p>Davis began his new role as a resident dean in July 2024.</p><p>In an email shared with Fox News Digital and signed by Shirley and Taeku Lee, a married couplewho are Dunster House Faculty Deans, the deans wrote, "We are writing to share a letter with you from our Resident Dean Gregory Davis about some recent reporting from campus media. As you know, Dean Davis has been on leave for the semester, and as such, we are sharing this message with you on his behalf."</p><p>They added that they want "to reaffirm that Dunster House is a community that welcomes all members. That continues to be our commitment to our students. If you have any questions or comments regarding Gregory’s letter, please do not hesitate to reach out to the two of us, to our Interim Resident Dean Emilie Raymer, or a tutor you feel comfortable reaching out to. As your faculty deans, our door is always open."</p><p>In another email shared by Harvard with Fox News Digital, Davis wrote, "Recently, some media organizations have inquired regarding comments that I made on my personal social media accounts prior to my start in the Resident Dean role. These posts do not reflect my current thinking or beliefs. I deeply appreciate the responsibility inherent in the Resident Dean role and I value the trust that individuals have placed in me. I regret if my statements have any negative impact on the Dunster community." </p><p>Davis added, "Since becoming the Allston Burr Resident Dean, I have worked hard to ensure that Dunster House is a welcoming, warm and supportive space for all of its members. That continues to be the guiding force of my work today. As events outside of Harvard have affected our House and me personally, my commitment to each of you, our students, has not wavered. In my role, I have enjoyed the opportunity to work collaboratively with members of HUPD and other colleagues across campus. I respect the work they do to support our community."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Kim Kardashian turned up the heat and showed off a racy look while attending a glamorous after-party in London Wednesday night.</p><p>The reality star, who turned 45 Tuesday, was spotted in a short sheer Dilara Findikoglu dress while leaving an exclusive gathering at the home of photographer Mert Alas following the premiere of her upcoming series, "All’s Fair."</p><p>Kardashian's daring dress featured a beige corset-style bodice with black cut-out bra cups made of braided hair and tight cinching around the waist.</p><p>The dress was embroidered with black braids, silver beading and crystals that draped around Kardashian's hips, along with a long tassel that hung from a silver buckle down the front.</p><p>Kardashian's accessories included a matching braided hair choker with a buckle. The Skims mogul paired the look with sheer black stockings and black leather open-toed heels.</p><p>She wore her hair in a braided bun, tying into the braided elements of the dress. Unlike her headline-making look from earlier this week, Kardashian left her face uncovered, dispelling online speculation that she had undergone plastic surgery.</p><p>On Saturday, the television personality stunned fans when she arrived at the fifth annual Academy Museum Gala wearing a nude-colored strapless corseted gown from the Maison Margiela Fall 2025 Couture collection, paired with a matching mask that covered her entire face.</p><p>The decision to cover her face sparked mixed reactions online.</p><p>"It's unnecessary and distracting to watch her contort her body to the point she cannot breathe," one user wrote on X.

<div class="article-title">Jaron 'Boots' Ennis talks family influence, promises to be boxing's next best pound-for-pound fighter</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Jaron "Boots" Ennis sat with his arms folded across a table, staring at his latest opponent, Uisma Lima, and telling him their boxing match would be short and sweet. </p><p>"In and out like a robbery," the 28-year-old Ennis said with a smirk. </p><p>Confidence is a necessity in boxing. A fighter must believe he will defeat his opponent no matter the odds. But Ennis, a Philadelphia native, seemed so sure of himself in that moment. </p><p>Granted, he was a heavy favorite, but this was his first fight at the 154-pound, junior middleweight division. </p><p>Yet, he backed up every word, knocking down Lima twice before a first-round stoppage to be granted the interim WBA junior middleweight belt Oct. 11 in his home city. When you are an undefeated boxer who has knocked out all but four opponents as a professional (35-0), it’s hard not to be overly confident. </p><p>But for Ennis, the canvas, ropes and gloves feel entirely like home. There’s a comfort because, after all, it’s the family business. </p><p>"I guess just me being around the boxing game for so long and seeing my brothers come up, I kinda knew what to expect," Ennis told Fox News Digital during a recent interview in New York City. "I knew what was going on. So, I’m just comfortable no matter where I’m at, whether it’s in the ring, doing interviews. Wherever, I’m always comfortable. I kinda see everything already. I’ve been here before."</p><p>In Philadelphia, the last name Ennis rings a bell in the boxing community. It starts with Derek "Bozy" Ennis, "Boots'" father and trainer, who was naturally harder on his boy than the rest of his clients. </p><p>"It’s expected because he knows what I can do," "Boots" said of his father’s training. "I gotta deliver it, so that’s what I be on. I don’t take the criticisms hard from my dad. It’s actually motivation for me to keep going."</p><p>"Boots" added that he prefers the tough love, saying, "I don’t want no yes men around me." He wants to know what he’s doing right or wrong. </p><p>But his brothers also laid the foundation for that. Derek "Pooh" Ennis and Farah "The Quiet Storm" Ennis were also professional fighters with lofty expectations, though they never competed for a world title like their little brother. </p><p>"Very supportive of each other. They just led the way," "Boots" said of his brothers’ influence. "They showed me what to do and what not to do, and I just followed their direction and always stayed in some type of shape and ready. You never know when you’re going to get that call. So, that’s what I do, try to stay in some type of shape, try to live the right lifestyle outside of boxing in case I do have to get a call, and I’ll be ready."</p><p>Since he was in a jumper, "Boots" was running around his father’s gym observing, training and understanding what it takes to compete at the highest level. </p><p>"I’ve seen it all, so I know what it takes," "Boots" said. "I know how everything goes and just having that confidence because I put the work in. I know what to do, and I know what I did. And I know can’t nobody do nothing with me. I’m in shape, I do everything right. I don’t cut no corners. My training camps be going great, so that’s where my confidence comes from for sure."</p><p>Even though it was his third time fighting in the South Philly arena earlier this month, "Boots" considered his first-round knockout of Lima a "full-circle moment" due to how important this fight was, even if Lima wasn’t the biggest name in the game. It was "Boots’" first fight in a new division after previously being the unified welterweight champion, holding both the IBF and WBA titles before making the jump to junior middleweight. </p><p>He's been training his whole life to get to this point in the sport, where the glorified "best pound-for-pound" debate involves his name. And he doesn’t mind the pressure or expectation, especially given his family history in the sport. </p><p>That was showcased with his patented confidence after the fight. He called out those in his new weight class, including Vergil Ortiz Jr., the WBC interim champion. </p><p>It’s a fight that’s in the works and expected for 2026 after Ortiz fights Nov. 8.</p><p>"I want to knock them down one by one. I want to show everyone why I’m the best in the world," he said. </p><p>The pound-for-pound conversation usually revolves around Terence "Bud" Crawford, especially after defeating Canelo Álvarez to become the undisputed super middleweight champion. He became the only male fighter in the four-belt era to be undisputed champion in three different weight classes, but that’s exactly what "Boots" is shooting for. </p><p>Some compare "Boots" to Crawford, but the former isn’t a fan of it. Not because he doesn’t respect Crawford’s fighting style. </p><p>"We’re totally two different fighters. I don’t like when they compare me and him together because we don’t fight nothing alike. He’s got his style, and I’ve got my style," "Boots" said. </p><p>If there’s anything "Boots" wants to be compared to when it comes to Crawford, it’s their legacy within boxing. Crawford is at the twilight of his career, while "Boots" is in his prime. The potential is there to be the pound-for-pound best in the sport, and "Boots" believes that conversation will only grow as he works through the 154-pound class. </p><p>"My legacy, like I’ve said, I want to be a multi-division champ. And I want to show the world that I’m really him. And I will," he said. "We started at [147 pounds] and I was lineal champion at 147. I’m in the history books at 147. Now, we’re at 154 now, and we just keep going. 154, 160 and possibly 168."</p><p>"Boots" simply replied, "Facts," when asked if he believes he’ll become that best-pound-for-pound boxer at some point in his career.</p><p>But the weight of those expectations has the ability to crush the shoulders of the fighter who’s burdened with them. However, "Boots" has the skill and the support system necessary to go through that hard-fought journey, which includes his mother, who he says will do whatever he needs to support his dream. </p><p>"Family means everything. Without them, I wouldn’t be where I’m at today," he said. "My brothers and my dad paved my way for me and my mom as well. They showed me what to do and what not to do and things like that. And treat people how you want to be treated. That’s how I carry myself."</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A string of questionable calls by a Southeastern Conference (SEC) officiating crew led by Ken Williamson, including controversial calls in Georgia's comeback win over Auburn two weeks ago, reportedly prompted serious disciplinary action.</p><p>Yellowhammer News reported that Williamson has been "permanently suspended from officiating conference games." </p><p>At least 11 complaints were logged against Williamson and his crew after the Auburn-Georgia game Oct. 11.</p><p>"According to sources, nine of those complaints were validated by conference officials," the outlet reported.</p><p>Auburn was leading late in the second quarter when Tigers quarterback Jackson Arnold fumbled the ball during a short yardage play near the goal line. After a video review, officials ruled Georgia recovered the ball before Arnold was able to score a touchdown.</p><p>The controversial decision on the close call prevented Auburn from taking a commanding 17-0 lead. Instead, Georgia drove down the field and kicked a field goal to cut the deficit to seven points. The Bulldogs won 20-10.</p><p>Former NFL referee and current NBC Sports rules analyst Terry McAulay weighed in after learning of reports about Williamson’s suspension. </p><p>"This is insane. Ken is a very good referee and has been for a very long time," McAulay wrote on X.</p><p>"I’ve commented on the Ga/Auburn game, and no, the crew did not have a very good game. It happens to officials, just as it happens to coaches and players," he continued. "I look forward to the day an AD suspends his coach for, in a single game, poor clock management, allowing players to feign injury, bad play calls, etc.</p><p>"Or let’s permanently bench a QB for throwing a game-ending interception regardless of his past performance.</p><p>"*If* this is solely based on that one game, then shame on everyone involved. It’s yet another reason why Conferences should not oversee officiating and will forever be a dark stain on college football."</p><p>Williamson has more than four decades of officiating experience and has been an SEC referee for 21 years. He was part of the officiating crew for the SEC championship game in 2021.</p><p>SEC officiating crews are routinely evaluated, according to the conference's accountability guidelines. The impact those evaluations have on any future assignments and personnel decisions are private.</p><p>Fox News Digital contacted the SEC for more information on Williamson's status.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups left an Oregon federal courthouse without answering questions on Thursday after he was arrested as part of an FBI gambling investigation.</p><p>Federal officials announced Billups was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. He’s set to be arraigned at a federal courthouse in New York on Nov. 24.</p><p>He was released from custody under certain conditions. He was forced to turn over his passport and was barred from gambling-related activity and having any contact with any of the 30-plus co-defendants who were also charged, including Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former player and assistant coach Damon Jones. He’s unable to travel outside of Oregon and Colorado.</p><p>"The conditions are standard and common in allegations like this," his attorney Chris Heywood told The Oregonian.

He was on the sidelines for the Trail Blazers’ game on Wednesday night.</p><p>The NBA placed him on administrative leave.</p><p>"We are in the process of reviewing the federal indictments announced today," the league said. "Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups are being placed on immediate leave from their teams, and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities. We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority."</p><p>The Trail Blazers said Thiago Splitter would take over head-coaching duties in the interim.</p><p>"We are aware of the allegations involving head coach Chauncey Billups, and the Trail Blazers are fully cooperating with the investigation," the team said.

Any further questions should be directed to the NBA."</p><p>"Anyone who knows Chauncey Billups knows he is a man of integrity; men of integrity do not cheat and defraud others," the statement read, via ESPN. "To believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his hall-of-fame legacy, his reputation, and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game.</p><p>"Furthermore, Chauncey Billups has never and would never gamble on basketball games, provide insider information, or sacrifice the trust of his team and the League, as it would tarnish the game he has devoted his entire life to. Chauncey Billups has never backed down. He does not plan to do so now. He will fight these allegations with the same tenacity that marked his 28-year career. We look forward to our day in court."</p><p>Billups and Jones were charged as part of an investigation into rigged poker games with alleged ties to the La Costa Nostra crime families.</p><p>Billups and Jones were allegedly dubbed as "face cards" which, the indictment says, were "members of the Cheating Teams and received a portion of the criminal proceeds in exchange for their participation in the scheme." The scheme resulted in the victims losing at least $7.15 million, dating back to April 2019, according to the Department of Justice.</p><p>"Billups and Jones, in particular… were utilized to attract victims to the games because of their status as former professional athletes," the DOJ said.</p><p>The DOJ added that in April 2019, Billups was one of five defendants who "organized and participated in rigged poker games" in Las Vegas "using a rigged shuffling machine" with the victims losing at least $50,000. One of the defendants texted another co-conspirator that Billups should purposefully lose a hand to avoid cheating suspicions.</p><p>During that game, a defendant said one of the victims had "acted like he wanted Chauncey to have his money" because he was "star struck" by Billups, according to officials.</p><p>In October 2020, Billups was allegedly wired $50,000 following a rigged poker game. Before one game, Jones allegedly asked for a $10,000 advance and said that he "needed" action "bad." He was given $2,500.</p><p>In response to being coached on how to cheat, Jones replied, "Lol man y'all call Djones in cause y'all know I know what I'm doing!!" according to the DOJ.</p><p>Billups was a three-time All-Star and an NBA champion with the Detroit Pistons.</p><p><i>Fox News' Ryan Morik contributed to this report.</i></p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued a formal letter to top California officials Thursday, warning them against any attempts to arrest or impede federal law enforcement officers enforcing immigration laws.</p><p>The letter, addressed to Gov. Gavin Newsom; state Attorney General Rob Bonta; Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.; and San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, stressed that federal agents and officers are carrying out lawful duties, and any interference by state or local officials is both "illegal and futile."</p><p>The letter was sent after Pelosi, the former House Speaker, and Rep. Kevin Mullin, D-Calif., issued a statement Wednesday threatening to arrest federal agents if they break California law.</p><p>If convicted, the Democrats noted, President Donald Trump cannot pardon agents.</p><p>"Reports of a planned mass immigration raid in the Bay Area are an appalling abuse of law enforcement power," Pelosi and Mullin wrote in the statement. "While the President may enjoy absolute immunity courtesy of his rogue Supreme Court, those who operate under his orders do not. … The people of San Francisco will continue to stand with the patriotic immigrants who are the constant reinvigoration of America."</p><p>Blanche shared his response in an X post, writing, "We just sent them a letter: Stand down or face prosecution. No one threatens our agents. No one will stop us from Making America Safe Again."</p><p>The letter cites several federal statutes that criminalize assaulting, impeding or conspiring against federal officers, and notes the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution dictates state officials cannot prosecute federal agents for actions taken in the course of their duties.</p><p>Blanche directed California leaders to "preserve all written and electronic communications and records related to any attempts or efforts to impede or obstruct federal law enforcement officials," forewarning that the Department of Justice will investigate and prosecute any official who violates federal statutes.</p><p>"We urge you and other California officials to publicly abandon this apparent criminal conspiracy, to stop threatening law enforcement, and to prioritize the safety of your citizens," Blanche wrote.</p><p>Pelosi's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

They also learned he failed his air brakes knowledge exam twice.</p><p>The Washington company that trained Singh for his CDL attested that he could speak English, even though he struggled to speak it proficiently, the senior official said. Still, Washington issued Singh his first CDL, and California later granted him another.</p><p>Bodycam footage released in August shows Singh struggling with limited English after being pulled over for speeding in New Mexico a month earlier, a detail that has become a major focal point in the case.</p><p>The footage shows Singh being stopped by a New Mexico State Police officer July 3 for allegedly driving 60 mph in a 45 mph zone.</p><p>Singh appeared apologetic as he received a ticket.

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Conservative businessman and broadcaster John Reid enlisted the help of artificial intelligence to represent Democratic challenger Ghazala Hashmi in a mock debate for the 2025 lieutenant governor’s race.</p><p>Reid, the Republican nominee from Richmond, challenged Hashmi, a state senator from Chesterfield, to a series of regional debates around Virginia. Reid noted Hashmi is the only candidate of the six running for statewide office to decline a debate.</p><p>A representative for Reid ensured that the AI only envisaged Hashmi’s likeness and voice — and that of the moderator – and the responses given by the representation of Hashmi were based on her prior quotes or publicized policy positions.</p><p>Hashmi’s campaign called the video a "deepfake" and told The Washington Post it was a "desperate move straight out of Donald Trump’s playbook."</p><p>"While we appreciate that ‘AI Ghazala’ did share her vision, like her commitment to public education and reproductive rights, it’s pretty clear Reid only cares about shoddy gimmicks and not governing," the campaign added.</p><p>The AI debate differed from other recent artificially created videos, where the words and representations of lawmakers were made to be cartoonish in some cases.</p><p>President Donald Trump shared a viral AI video earlier this month showing House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., wearing a sombrero as "La Cucaracha" played in the background and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., referred to his party as "woke pieces of s---." </p><p>Schumer never said that in real life.</p><p>For her opening statement in the debate, the "AI Hashmi" said she is running because Virginians need "someone who has the experience, knowledge and ability to fight for Virginians."</p><p>"I have a track record with regard to the issues Virginians care about — education, health care, housing and opportunity. I am ready to make policy that will make Virginia an example for other states."</p><p>In response, Reid — in real life — noted that Hashmi would not appear for a real debate.</p><p>"If she’s not willing to engage in her own campaign for lieutenant governor, I don’t know why anybody thinks she would be able to fight for anything," he said.</p><p>Reid said Hashmi supported keeping Virginia schools closed an extra year after the coronavirus pandemic and has "push[ed] for boys in girl sports… higher taxes [and] releasing criminals early."</p><p>"Everything that we would ID as a problem in the state of Virginia, Ghazala Hashmi has pushed," he said.</p><p>In this regard, Reid said his work in communications in Congress, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and radio help him understand what businesses need from state government if they choose to operate in Virginia.</p><p>The lieutenant governorship is "not just gaveling in the Senate," Reid said.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Democratic donors reportedly backed out of a major fundraising event for former Vice President Kamala Harris, with one even sending a "profanity-laced rejection," according to a report Wednesday.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has been struggling to raise money during President Donald Trump's second term in office. </p><p>According to several people "familiar with the conversations," the DNC attempted to reach out to major donors earlier this year through the San Francisco-based fundraiser, but most had declined.</p><p>"Upon receiving the invitation, one replied with a profanity-laced rejection," the report read. "Others said they didn’t want to give to the party until it produced substantive plans to win elections. Those who declined told the national party they had commitments and couldn’t make it work."</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported that the DNC eventually found a donor to host the event but it "raised less than organizers had hoped."</p><p>It added that this reaction, as well as a significant decrease in funding, could be a response to frustrations over Harris' failed presidential campaign and a lack of a new game plan for the midterm elections.</p><p>"A top official at a national Democratic group said some donors remain angry about how their money was spent in last year’s presidential election by outside groups, including on what they see as excessive salaries for Washington, D.C., consultants. The official said the party has failed to complete a public postelection investigation into what went wrong in 2024," the report said.</p><p>Rachel Pritzker, chair of the think tank Third Way, also told The Wall Street Journal, "It is shocking how little reassessment the party and its leadership has done."</p><p>However, some were more optimistic about the party's chances, with some donors reportedly focusing more on state-level elections, like Abigail Spanberger's bid for Virginia governor.</p><p>According to The Wall Street Journal, the DNC has about $12 million in cash reserves compared to the $86 million held by the Republican National Committee. Though some told The Wall Street Journal that this was a reflection of the party that is out of power raising less money.

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Pakistani national was sentenced to 40 years in federal prison for his part in running a smuggling ring that funneled Iranian-made advanced arms to the Houthis, a deadly mission that led to the deaths of two U.S. Navy SEALs in the Arabian Sea.</p><p>A federal jury convicted Muhammad Pahlawan June 5, 2025, of conspiring to provide material support and resources to terrorists and to Iran’s weapons of mass destruction program, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). He was also found guilty of conspiring to transport explosive devices to the Houthis, knowing they would be used to cause harm, and of threatening his crew.</p><p>According to court records, U.S. Central Command Navy forces operating from the USS Lewis B. Puller — including Navy SEALs and members of the U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Security Response Team East — boarded a small vessel Jan. 11.</p><p>The boarding team encountered 14 people on the vessel, including Pahlawan. During the search, they seized Iranian-made advanced conventional weaponry, including ballistic missile components, anti-ship cruise missile components and a warhead.</p><p>The DOJ said the type of weaponry found on the vessel was consistent with arms used by Houthi rebel forces targeting merchant and U.S. military ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden after the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.</p><p>Pahlawan lied to the boarding team and told other crew members to lie, threatening their lives and the lives of their families.</p><p>Two Navy SEALs — Navy Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Christopher J. Chambers and Navy Special Warfare Operator 2nd Class Nathan Gage Ingram — died during the encounter. The DOJ said Ingram began climbing a ladder onto the boat when he slipped and fell into a gap created by waves between the vessel and the SEAL watercraft.</p><p>As Ingram went under, Chambers jumped into the gap to try and save him.</p><p>The DOJ said the Navy conducted an extensive search to find and rescue the SEALs, but they were declared dead Jan. 22.</p><p>Pahlawan’s trip that day was part of a larger operation, the DOJ added, explaining that from August 2023 through January 2024, he worked with two Iranian brothers — Shahab Mir’kazei and Yunus Mir’kazei — affiliated with the IRGC to smuggle materials from Iran to recipients, including Houthi rebel forces in Yemen.</p><p>He completed multiple smuggling missions by carrying cargo from Iran to the coast of Somalia, where he transferred it to another vessel during nighttime ship-to-ship operations, the DOJ said.</p><p>Pahlawan also worked with Shahab and Yunus to prepare the vessel for multiple smuggling missions, obtained coordinates from them for ship-to-ship transfers and was paid for his role in the operation.</p><p>On Feb. 11, 2024, the U.S. secured arrest warrants for four of the foreign nationals, identified as Pahlawan, Mohammad Mazhar, Ghufran Ullah and Izhar Muhammad.</p><p>The four men, who were found with Pakistani identification cards, were transferred from the USSLewis B.

Prosecutors laid out a detailed sequence during their opening statements. </p><p>Senior Deputy District Attorney Dave Porter told jurors that surveillance video showed Richard Nicholson returning home around 12:45 p.m. on the day of his death, according to The Orange County Register. Inside the garage, Camden Nicholson confronted his father after his parents had urged him to seek treatment for mental health and addiction issues.</p><p>Nicholson, described as "completely dependent on his parents," stabbed his father "over and over again," Porter said. He then moved his father’s body into a small bathroom and blocked the doorway with towels to contain the blood.</p><p>When his mother returned home a short time later, Nicholson struck her with a metal statue and stabbed her multiple times, killing her in the garage.</p><p>"There was so much blood, the defendant tried to soak it up with a bag of flour," Porter told jurors. Investigators also found clumps of Kim Nicholson’s hair, suggesting she fought for her life.</p><p>The next morning, when Morse arrived for work, Nicholson stabbed her repeatedly and slit her throat before placing her body inside a large plastic bin in the kitchen pantry, according to the Orange County District Attorney’s Office.</p><p>Prosecutors said Nicholson took his parents’ car and went on a spending spree after the murders, purchasing hundreds of dollars in items at a Santa Ana marijuana dispensary and buying sex toys.</p><p>The following night, around 8:30 p.m. Feb. 13, 2019, Nicholson drove to a Kaiser Permanente site in Irvine, where he called 911 and claimed he had killed his parents in self-defense because he believed they were trying to kill him.</p><p>When Newport Beach police officers arrived at the home for a welfare check, they found the house in disarray with blood throughout and all three victims suffering from multiple stab wounds.</p><p>Nicholson’s defense attorneys argued he had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and should be found not guilty by reason of insanity.</p><p>Defense attorney Richard Cheung said Nicholson’s mental health struggles began around 2012 during a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Florida, when he was hospitalized on a psychiatric hold and treated with antipsychotic medication, the Register reported. </p><p>Nicholson lived independently in Colorado in 2017, where he began hormone therapy, stopped taking his medication and again experienced visions and voices, the defense said.</p><p>In December 2018 and early February 2019, Nicholson was admitted to mental health centers, which his attorneys said showed he was delusional and unreachable by his family leading up to the killings.</p><p>The sanity phase of his trial began Thursday to determine whether Nicholson was legally insane at the time of the murders.

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Jon Bon Jovi is hitting the road again for the first time since undergoing major surgery in 2022 to fix a "dying" vocal cord.</p><p>During an interview Thursday on the "Today" show, the 63-year-old music icon announced his band, Bon Jovi, will launch its international "The Forever Tour" in July 2026.</p><p>While speaking with host Savannah Guthrie, Bon Jovi opened up about recovering from the vocal injury that nearly ended his decades-long career.</p><p>"One of my cords was atrophied, and the strong one was pushing the weak one around, and this one was dying," he shared.</p><p>The "Livin' on a Prayer" hitmaker explained that "40 years of hard work" had strained his vocal cords.</p><p>However, Bon Jovi found a surgeon who performed a medialization thyroplasty surgery, a cutting-edge procedure in which an implant was placed on the outside of his vocal cord to rebuild the weakened cord.</p><p>"The road's been long and tough, but I persevered," he said.</p><p>Following the operation, Bon Jovi said he embarked on a lengthy recovery process that included months of rehabilitation, vocal exercises and rebuilding his stamina.</p><p>Bon Jovi noted that the injury could have ended his career entirely, telling Guthrie if he was unable to restore his voice to its former strength, he would have given up performing.</p><p>"I’m not that applause junkie. I do it for the joy, and I do it for the art," Bon Jovi said. "The rest of it is great because I’m good at it. But if you couldn’t do it from a place of joy, what’s the motivation?</p><p>"I have other things in my life. It’s what I do. It’s not who I am."</p><p>However, he said he was determined to make a full recovery and return to the stage. Bon Jovi explained that he has devoted himself to rehearsing for hours every day in his garage to retrain his voice.</p><p>"It’s like training for a marathon," Bon Jovi said. "Anyone can go for a run. Being able to go the distance is a whole different set of commitment. You have to physically, mentally and spiritually be ready to do that again."</p><p>The Grammy Award winner admitted there were many days he feared he had already performed his final concert.</p><p>"And then the next day, there'd be a little ray of hope," Bon Jovi shared. "The next day was brighter. And until the next time, you get punched in the nose by some setback, you pick yourself up again and do it again."</p><p>Bon Jovi said he now feels ready to perform again at his previous pace.</p><p>"I think I can confidently say that I can go and do my 2½ hours, night after night after night," he said. "But I wouldn’t do it unless it was that."</p><p>Bon Jovi's interview was conducted inside New York City's Madison Square Garden, where he will perform his tour's first concert.</p><p>"There are very few people in this world that can carry an arena. I know it's exciting. Is it also a little scary?" Guthrie asked him.</p><p>"Sure, but you know, it's just, that's the human element," he replied. "The good news is that I know that the band have my back and I can guarantee you that every person that will fill this house will be rooting for me."</p><p>On Oct. 24, Bon Jovi released its "Forever (Legendary Edition)" collaboration album, in which the band teamed up with some of the music world's biggest stars, including Bruce Springsteen, Jelly Roll and Avril Lavigne, to create new versions of songs from a 2024 album.</p><p>"It was a joy," he said of working with the singers featured on the album.</p><p>"It was also beautiful, as a songwriter, to hear your songs interpreted by great artists," he added.</p><p>Bon Jovi said kicking off the tour at Madison Square Garden holds special meaning for the band. They made their first appearance at the legendary venue when they opened for ZZ Top in 1983.</p><p>"It's the Garden," he said. "There's nothing like it."</p><p>Bon Jovi's Forever Tour will kick off July 7, 2026, and conclude Sept. 4, 2026, at London's Wembley Stadium.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Jennifer Welch, an interior designer and co-host of the "I’ve Had It" podcast, criticized the Trump administration on Thursday, referring to White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller as a "Nazi Jew."</p><p>Far-left commentators have frequently compared President Donald Trump and his allies to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, a comparison many argue is irresponsible in America’s increasingly politically charged climate.</p><p>The co-hosts of the "I’ve Had It" podcast appeared on CNN with host Abby Phillip in an episode titled "Keeping Up With the Cult." Phillip said that while she believes it is beneficial to allow people of differing perspectives to share their views, she encourages guests to express what they "really believe."</p><p>"Let’s put it on the table. Sometimes I think about the ’80s and the quiet bigotry that existed at that time. And I do wonder, would we be better off if we just knew? If people just actually were upfront about their views rather than it’s kind of like underneath the surface?" Phillip said.</p><p>Welch then appeared to mock the phrase "I don't see color" as a way people hide their racism. </p><p>When it comes to "reprehensible" views in politics, Phillip argued it is the duty of leaders to draw a line and say their parties are not open to such ideologies. </p><p>"I don’t know if that’s really cancel culture so much as, like, leadership," Phillip argued. </p><p>"What do you do when the racists are in charge, like they are now?" Welch asked.</p><p>"I mean, like Stephen Miller is a White supremacist. I mean, he is. And he's basically running the White House. They keep Trump busy with his decorating projects. He's got building the arch now. He's got his Oval Office design," she continued. "And then you have these real sociopaths that are real antisemites, true White supremacists like Steven Miller. And even though he's Jewish, he's like a Nazi Jew."</p><p>A spokeswoman from the White House argued this was a "braindead take" typical of an interior designer trying to comment on politics.</p><p>"If Jennifer wants to sound like she has more than three brain cells, she should stick to couches and countertops and stop spewing hateful comments that incite radical leftists to commit acts of violence against Republicans," the spokeswoman argued.</p><p>During the interview, Phillip offered tepid pushback to Welch’s accusation of Miller being a "Nazi Jew."</p><p>"Well, look, I can't speak to what Stephen Miller's motivations are. I've met him. I've talked to him. I've interviewed him," the CNN host said.</p><p>"How tall is he?" Welch asked.</p><p>"Yeah, we’re dying to know," podcast co-host Angie "Pumps" Sullivan added.</p></body></div></body></html>

It's false," Trump said. "But we're not happy with Venezuela for a lot of reasons, drugs being one of them. But, also, they've been sending their prisoners into our country. … Nobody can do that."</p><p>Secretary of War Pete Hegseth did not correct the president during the Q&amp;A with reporters.</p><p>During the roundtable with law enforcement and administration officials to discuss the successes of Homeland Security task forces, Trump honed in on the ongoing efforts to curb illegal drug smuggling into the U.S., noting he believes the cartels will begin infiltrating the U.S. by land.</p><p>"Now they're coming in by land," Trump said. "Even the land is concerned, because I told them … the land is going to be next. We may go to the Senate, we may go to Congress and tell them about it. But I can't imagine they'd have any problem with it."</p><p>"Between that and my discussion with [Chinese] President Xi, I think we have never made progress like we've made," Trump added. "The sea drugs are almost dead, and they can't come in that fast from the land. And the land drugs are much more dangerous for them. It's going to be much more dangerous. You'll be seeing that soon. So, that's the way it is."</p><p>Hours earlier, Hegseth confirmed the U.S. military carried out a lethal kinetic strike on a suspected narco-trafficking vessel Wednesday, killing three suspects.</p><p>The attack marked the ninth vessel strike since September and the second strike reported in the Eastern Pacific.</p><p>A total of 37 people have reportedly been killed, with two survivors later repatriating to their home countries.</p><p>When asked by reporters why he is not asking Congress to approve a declaration of war against the cartels, the president said he did not think it was needed.</p><p>"I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war," Trump said. "I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. … They're going to be, like, dead."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump: Federal deployment to San Francisco called off after conversation with mayor</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump announced Thursday that he has <span class="link">called off a plan</span> to deploy  federal agents to San Francisco, following a conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie.</p><p>In a statement on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said prominent tech company bosses had also  contacted him Wednesday, urging him not to go forward with a so-called "surge" operation set for Saturday, saying the city was making "substantial progress."</p><p>"I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around," the president said.</p><p>"Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a 'shot.' Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!" Trump said in conclusion, mentioning Huang, the CEO of chipmaker Nvidia and Benioff, the CEO and co-founder of Salesforce.</p><p>Two Department of Homeland Security officials also told CBS News Thursday afternoon that the planned Border Patrol operation in San Francisco had been canceled. </p>
<p>Lurie said in a separate statement Thursday that he had received a call from the president late Wednesday night.</p><p>"I told him the same thing I told our residents: San Francisco is on the rise. Visitors are coming back, buildings are getting leased and purchased, and workers are coming back to the office," Lurie said. "In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem reaffirmed that direction in our conversation this morning."</p><p>The mayor added, "I am profoundly grateful to all the San Franciscans who came together over the last several days. Our city leaders have been united behind the goal of public safety. And our values have been on full display—this is the best of our city."</p>
<p>At a news conference Thursday afternoon, Lurie noted recently released crime statistics, which showed significant declines.</p>
<p>"Today, in San Francisco, crime is down nearly 30% citywide. And violent crime is at its lowest levels since the 1950s. Car break-ins are at 22-year lows and homicides are on track to hit 70-year lows," the mayor said. "Our new approach is delivering results."</p><p>Lurie also revealed that he spoke with Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday, in addition to Noem, and received assurances in tackling the fentanyl crisis.</p><p>"She echoed her willingness to our local law enforcement to combat fentanyl and hold drug traffickers responsible," Lurie said.</p><p>Benioff sparked controversy earlier this month in an interview with the New York Times, urging Trump to deploy the National Guard to the city to address public safety. The comments were made ahead of the company's annual Dreamforce convention in San Francisco.</p><p>Following pushback from city officials and after saying the conference was successful, <span class="link">Benioff apologized for his comments</span>.</p><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom voiced support for Mr. Trump's last-minute change of plan.</p><p>"Trump has finally, for once, listened to reason – and heard what we have been saying from the beginning," said Newsom, who once served as San Francisco's mayor himself. "The Bay Area is a shining example of what makes California so special, and any attempt to erode our progress would damage the work we've done."</p>
<p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised the mayor in her statement. </p><p>"Mayor Daniel Lurie has demonstrated exceptional leadership in his steadfast commitment to the safety and well-being of San Franciscans," Pelosi said. "He has underscored that public safety must be driven by local priorities, respectful of our values and communities."</p><p>The announcement came  on the same day Border Patrol agents <span class="link">were expected to arrive at Coast Guard Island in Alameda</span> as the Trump administration's nationwide immigration crackdown was set to expand to the Bay Area.</p><p>Across the Bay in Oakland, political and community leaders gathered outside Oakland City Hall to denounce the arrival of Border Patrol agents, urging citizens to remain calm despite what Mayor Barbara Lee called the federal government's "escalated rhetoric and enforcement posture" in the Bay Area.</p><p>"These federal actions are not about public safety," Lee said. "They're political stunts designed to divide and to intimidate. Oakland will not take the bait. We will remain calm, focused and united."</p><p>Lee said that while Trump called off a planned immigration enforcement surge in San Francisco, she doesn't know what the administration's plans are for Oakland and neighboring cities.</p><p>"I have not received any communication from the White House or the Department of Homeland Security regarding federal operations in Oakland; however, I am in touch with the Governor's Office and our federal delegation," Lee said. </p>
<p>She added, "We know that border patrol agents are being stationed on Coast Guard Island, but let me be clear, our city, we are fully prepared.  We are monitoring developments closely and will keep our residents informed if there are any confirmed changes. We will continue to be a welcoming city for immigrants. "</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump says he's cutting off all trade talks with Canada over anti-tariff ad</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump said late Thursday he's ending trade talks with Canada, citing an anti-tariff ad campaign by the province of Ontario that uses late President Ronald Reagan's voice.</p><p>"Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED," the president wrote on Truth Social.</p><p>The president appeared to be referencing an ad released last week by Ontario that includes excerpts from a 1987 radio address given by Reagan, in which the former president said tariffs work "only for a short time" and "hurt every American worker and consumer." </p><p>"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars," Reagan said, as quoted by the ad.</p><p>CBS News has reached out to the White House, Global Affairs Canada, and the Ontario premier's office for comment. </p>
<p>Earlier Thursday, the Ronald Reagan Foundation said in a statement posted to X the ad used "selective audio" and "misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address." The foundation also said the government of Ontario didn't seek permission to use snippets from Reagan's address, and said it is "reviewing its legal options in this matter."</p><p>Mr. Trump pointed to the Ronald Reagan Foundation's statement in his Truth Social post, calling Ontario's ad "FAKE" and claiming it "only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court" — referring to <span class="link">a pending case</span> on the legality of Mr. Trump's tariff strategy.</p><p>Canada is the second-largest trading partner for the U.S. after Mexico, with the U.S. importing $412.7 billion worth of Canadian goods last year, and Canada buying $349.4 billion in American goods, according to U.S. statistics.</p><p>But relations between the U.S. and its northern neighbor <span class="link">have frayed amid Mr. Trump's trade strategy</span>. He initially imposed higher tariffs on Canada earlier this year, accusing the country of not doing enough to stem the flow of illicit drugs and migration across the border — allegations that Canadian officials pushed back on.</p>
<p>Over the summer, Mr. Trump <span class="link">hiked tariffs on the country</span> to 35%, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.</p><p>Back in March, Canada imposed 25% retaliatory tariffs on many U.S. products not covered by the USMCA. But in August, as part of efforts to reach a deal on tariffs, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney <span class="link">said those retaliatory tariffs were being lifted</span>. The two nations have yet to reach such a deal.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Carney said earlier this week the country would seek to double its exports to countries other than the U.S., citing the "pall of uncertainty" caused by American tariffs.</p><p>Still, Carney has sought to negotiate with Mr. Trump, visiting the White House earlier this month.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Tropical Storm Melissa is expected to bring days of heavy rain to the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Jamaica and may trigger life-threatening flash flooding, the National Hurricane Center says.</p><p>It is forecast to become a hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by the end of the weekend, the hurricane center said. </p><p>Melissa, which is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major <span class="link">impacts on the mainland United States</span>.</p><h2>Tropical Storm Melissa forecast and path</h2><p>On Thursday night, Melissa's core was about 150 miles south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 270 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, the hurricane center said. Maximum sustained winds were 45 mph, with tropical storm-force winds extending up to 140 miles out from the storm's center. It was inching north at only 3 mph.</p>
<p>The storm is expected to linger over the central Caribbean for the next several days, according to CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan, as it is moving very slowly. It is sitting over very warm waters.</p>
<p>On the forecast track, Melissa "is expected to move closer to Jamaica and the southwestern portion of Haiti during the next couple of days," the hurricane center said.</p>
<p>Little change in the storm's strength is expected over the next day or so, but "significant strengthening is expected by late Friday and over the weekend," the hurricane center said.</p><p>A hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning were in place for Jamaica and the southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the Dominican Republic to Port-au-Prince. </p>
<h2>Rainfall forecasts</h2><p>Melissa is forecast to bring anywhere from 8 to 14 inches of rain to portions of the southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti and eastern Jamaica through Sunday, with locally higher amounts possible, the hurricane center said. "Additional heavy rainfall is possible beyond Sunday," it continued, but uncertainty about Melissa's track and speed makes the exact totals harder to predict.</p>
<p>"Regardless, significant, life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides are expected," forecasters said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Eric Adams endorses Andrew Cuomo in NYC mayor's race</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has endorsed former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the race to replace him. </p><p>The endorsement came just <span class="link">two days before the start of early voting</span>.</p><p>Adams and Cuomo appeared Thursday afternoon at NYCHA's Carver Houses, where they embraced as they met. </p><p>"Andrew and I are two kids from New York, and when you think about it, Andrew and his brother, and I have three of them, and brothers fight," Adams said. "But when families are attacked, brothers come together. They understand that you have to protect the family." </p><p>Adams admitted he was "angry" he's not the one taking on Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>"But you know what, the city means more to me than anything, and it is time for us as a family to come together," the mayor said. </p><p>It's the endorsement Cuomo has been waiting for ever since Adams dropped out of the race, and represented a major mending of fences between two men who said harsh things about each other in the heat of the campaign. It was only last month <span class="link">Adams called Cuomo "a snake and a liar"</span> as the two campaigned for Gracie Mansion. </p><h2>Adams blasts Mamdani's plan to freeze the rent </h2><p>Adams went on to take Mamdani's rent freeze promise to task. </p><p>"When you lie and state you can freeze rent - you can't freeze rent in NYCHA. You can't freeze rent in Mitchell-Lama. You can't freeze rent in market rate housing. You can't freeze rent, but you are lying and telling people you can do so. We're fighting against a snake oil salesman who has sold us a bill of goods," Adams said. "And who is his base of support? Gentrifiers. Gentrifiers have raised the rent in this city, and disrespected communities for far too long. And he is the king of the gentrifiers." </p>
<p>"He believes Zohran is an existential threat to New York City, and we all have to do our best to make sure that Zohran does not become the next mayor," Cuomo said. "I applaud him for that, and I have great respect for that." </p><p>Cuomo, who is running as an independent, stressed he and Adams, who ran for reelection as an independent, are Democrats. </p><p>"Zohran is not a Democrat. Democratic socialist is a different thing. It shouldn't even have the word 'democratic' in front of it. They are socialists. Look up the platform of the Democratic Socialists of America. It has nothing to do with the Democratic party," Cuomo said. </p><p>Cuomo blasted Mamdani as divisive, citing concern he said Mamdani has sparked in the Jewish, Italian and LGBTQ+ communities. </p><p>Cuomo and Mamdani also tangled about his appearance on the Sid and Friends radio show, and a back-and-forth with host Sid Rosenberg about Cuomo's charge that Mamdani lacks experience.</p><p>"Any given morning, there's a crisis. And people's lives are at stake. God forbid, another 9/11. Can you imagine Mamdani in the seat?" Cuomo said on the show. </p><p>"Yeah I could. He'd be cheering," Rosenberg said. </p>
<p>Mamdani called it Islamophobia. </p><p>"To look at a city where one in eight New Yorkers are Muslim and say that, by virtue of your faith, you are worthy of suspicion. It is both incredibly disappointing and yet not surprising, given how Andrew Cuomo has run this campaign," Mamdani said. </p><p>"The host said whatever the host said. All right, that's the host. Go talk to the host about that. I said, I said about 9/11, that's another problem. Referring to what I have said repeatedly, which is, I have a problem with the fact that Zohran pals around with Hassan Piker, who said America deserved 9/11," Cuomo said. </p><h2>Endorsement comes on heels of final debate</h2><p>Adams' endorsement comes a day after <span class="link">Cuomo joined Adams courtside at the Knicks home opener</span> following the <span class="link">final mayoral debate</span>. </p>
<p>Adams <span class="link">was running for reelection himself</span> until late September, when <span class="link">he ended his campaign and exited the race</span>. The outgoing mayor has been an <span class="link">outspoken critic of Mamdani</span> and was rumored to be <span class="link">considering throwing his support behind Cuomo</span> for the past week or so. </p><p>Mamdani said the two teaming up is an "illustration for New Yorkers of the fact that Eric Adams' record is Andrew Cuomo's agenda." </p><p>"Today confirms what we've long known: Andrew Cuomo is running for Eric Adams' second term. It's no surprise to see two men who share an affinity for corruption and Trump capitulation align themselves at the behest of the billionaire class and the President himself. We are going to turn the page on the politics of big money and small ideas that these two disgraced executives embody and build a city every New Yorker can afford," Mamdani said in a statement Thursday. </p>
<p>Cuomo, who served as governor of New York from 2013 until <span class="link">he resigned in 2021</span>, <span class="link">lost the Democratic primary to Mamdani</span> in June and has since been <span class="link">consistently polling second</span> heading into the general election. A <span class="link">poll earlier this week</span> showed Mamdani holding onto a double-digit lead in a three-way race with Republican Curtis Sliwa. </p><p>The poll, meanwhile, found it would be neck-and-neck between Mamdani and Cuomo if Sliwa were to exit.</p><h2>Sliwa remains on the offensive about staying in</h2><p>"This is corruption past, corruption present, and corruption waiting to happen again. Take a look at this. They can co-author the book 'The Art of the Steal,'" Sliwa said in a statement. </p><p>Sliwa has <span class="link">repeatedly vowed to stay in the race</span>, even parting with <span class="link">longtime WABC radio boss John Catsimatidis</span>.</p><p>"Why would I drop out of the race? You think Republicans are going to vote for Andrew Cuomo?" Sliwa said during the debate.</p><p>Sliwa punched hard during an interview on CNBC Thursday morning in an effort to prove he deserves to stay on the ballot, and blamed Adams for the state of the race. </p><p>"He belongs in jail. He's the reason there's a Zohran Mamdani, because if he had done a halfway decent job he would've won. He's an incumbent mayor. It would've been round two because I ran against him in 2021," Sliwa said.</p>
<h2>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries to speak with Mamdani Thursday night</h2><p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told Rev. Al Sharpton he plans to speak with Mamdani Thursday night. </p><p>Jeffries has yet to make an endorsement in the race.</p><p>"I do hope to talk to the Democratic nominee either late today or tomorrow, in advance of early voting," Jeffries said. "I do think that his decision to announce that he would reappoint [NYPD] Commissioner Jessica Tisch is a positive step in the right direction in terms of sending the message that, while he is going to of course focus on affordability — and that is the number one concern of the people in the communities I represent. And some things really need to be done, particularly in Black and Brown communities, which have suffered under the crushing weight of gentrification and displacement in neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant and Harlem … that's going to be important and at the top of his agenda. But also that public safety of course will continue to be important in communities throughout the City of New York. I think it's reassuring to a lot of folks that he's going to continue the leadership at One Police Plaza."</p><p>Political expert David Birdsell says Jeffries' endorsement would be a step in the right direction as Mamdani tries to win over the doubters in the Democratic Party.</p><p>"If Hakeem Jeffries were in fact to endorse Zohran Mamdani, it would be a vote of confidence from the Democratic establishment. You don't get much more established at this point than the Minority Leader, who is hoping to become the Speaker of the House in January of 2027," he said.</p><h2>Key takeaways from the NYC mayoral debate</h2><p>The candidates made their case to voters and <span class="link">covered a lot of ground</span> during Wednesday night's debate.</p><p>They were asked to address the <span class="link">recent federal immigration raids</span> and how to handle <span class="link">threats from the Trump administration</span>.</p>
<p>They also spoke about the NYPD and all agreed <span class="link">Commissioner Tisch</span> should remain the department's leader.</p><p>Mamdani called out Cuomo over his <span class="link">sexual harassment scandal as governor</span>, and both Cuomo and Sliwa questioned Mamdani about his experience for the job and his <span class="link">stance on Israel</span>.</p><p>In addition, the candidates offered up their ideas for mass transit and what should be done about the deadline to close Rikers Island.</p><p>Mamdani also refused to take positions on crucial ballot measures that would address the very housing issues he's centered his platform around.</p><p>"What a shocker. Once he takes a position, he'll change it anyway," Cuomo said.</p><p>Mamdani responded with a zinger of his own.</p><p>"We heard from Donald Trump's puppet, himself, Andrew Cuomo. He spent more money on a singing water fountain at LaGuardia Airport than he did on the average cost of an affordable housing unit," Mamdani said. </p>
<h2>Why did Mayor Adams drop out?</h2><p>Adams took office as <span class="link">the city's 110th mayor in January 2022</span> after serving as Brooklyn borough president.   </p><p>He <span class="link">ended his reelection campaign on Sept. 28</span>, but his name will still appear on the ballot under an independent line. </p><p>It has been a <span class="link">tumultuous past year</span> for the mayor and his administration. He was <span class="link">indicted on federal bribery charges</span>, which <span class="link">he denied</span>, that <span class="link">were later dropped</span>. The dismissal also <span class="link">raised questions about his relationship with President Trump</span> and the <span class="link">influence of the White House on City Hall</span>. </p><p>Adams <span class="link">maintained his innocence</span> and his ability to lead the city, <span class="link">launching his reelection campaign</span> over the summer. But most polls showed him <span class="link">garnering single-digit support</span>, well behind Mamdani, Cuomo and Sliwa.</p><p>"Despite all we've achieved, I cannot continue my reelection campaign. The constant media speculation about my future and the Campaign Finance Board's decision to withhold millions of dollars have undermined my ability to raise the funds needed for a serious campaign," Adams said in a video announcement when he dropped out.   </p><p>Independent candidate Jim Walden <span class="link">also ended his campaign and exited the race</span>, but the Board of Elections ruled he <span class="link">missed the May 30 deadline to remove his name from the ballot</span>. </p>

<div class="article-title">FBI: Rigged poker games used X-ray tables, hidden cameras to steal millions</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>X-ray tables. Hidden cameras. Pre-marked cards. Even special contact lenses. Prosecutors say the suspects charged Thursday in a <span class="link">high-profile illegal gambling bust</span> made use of sophisticated technology to cheat victims out of millions.</p><p>In a series of arrests Thursday morning, law enforcement officers across the country took several big names in NBA basketball and <span class="link">dozens of alleged criminal figures</span> into custody on illegal betting charges. One case focuses on sports betting while another involves allegations of elaborately rigged high-stakes poker games.</p><p>FBI officials said at a news conference that the poker ring was operated by organized crime figures from "La Cosa Nostra," referring to known mafia families. The 31 defendants include alleged members of the Bonnano, Gambino, Luchesse and Genovese crime families, as well as Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and former player Damon Jones. <span class="link">Miami Heat star Terry Rozier</span> is charged only in the sports betting case.</p><p>The poker scheme started as early as 2019, with rigged games played in New York City, Las Vegas, the Hamptons, Miami and other locations, officials said.</p><p>"The fraud is mind-boggling," FBI Director Kash Patel said at the briefing. Ricky Patel, the Special Agent in Charge for Homeland Security Investigations in New York, said the scheme "cheated victims out of at least $7 million."</p>
<p>Joseph Nocella, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said the defendants allegedly used a "variety of very sophisticated cheating technologies" to rig poker games with thousands of dollars at stake — and he described some in detail.</p><h2>Targeting "fish" with "face cards" </h2><p>The victims of the schemes were called "fish," Nocello said. They were lured into the games with the chance to play alongside professional athletes, Nocello said. The pro athletes were known as "face cards." The "face cards" included Jones and Billups, he said. </p><p>Those involved, from the dealer to the "face cards," knew about the scheme, Nocello said. </p><p>"Once the game was underway, the defendants fleeced the victims out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per game," Nocello said. </p>
<h2>A "quarterback" and secret information from shuffling machines</h2><p>Those taking part in the scheme allegedly used self-shuffling machines that had been "secretly altered" to read the cards in a deck and predict which player at the table had the best poker hand, Nocello said. </p><p>That information was then sent to an off-site operator who allegedly sent the information via cellphone to the co-conspirator at the table. The co-conspirator, known as the quarterback, then allegedly secretly signaled the information to other defendants and used that information to win the poker game. </p>
<p>One rigged shuffling machine was obtained at gunpoint, Nocello said. </p><h2>Hidden cameras and X-ray tables </h2><p>The defendants allegedly used a kind of poker chip tray that secretly reads cards with a hidden camera to analyze the chips that were in use, Nocello said. </p><p>They also allegedly used special contact lenses or eyeglasses capable of reading pre-marked cards, and an X-ray table that could read cards even when they were placed face-down, according to the charging documents. </p><p>Hidden cameras were also built into tables and light fixtures, said New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. </p><h2>"A financial pipeline" for the mafia</h2><p>Members of organized crime families allegedly got involved because they had pre-existing control of non-rigged but illegal poker games in New York City, Nocello said. </p>
<p>They worked to organize the games and took a cut of the proceedings, according to Nocello. They also allegedly worked to enforce the collection of debts, Nocello said. </p><p>The games "created a financial pipeline for La Cosa Nostra" — the mafia — "to help fund and facilitate their organized criminal activity," said Christopher Raia, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York Field Office.</p><h2>Shell companies and cryptocurrencies </h2><p>The defendants allegedly laundered the proceeds from the rigged games through cash exchanges, multiple shell companies and cryptocurrency transfers, Nocello said. </p><h2>Technology suppliers</h2><p>Some of the cheating technologies were provided by defendants named in the indictment, Nocello said. The defendants who did so then allegedly received a share of profits from the rigged games, he said. </p><h2>NBA's Rozier and Billups placed on leave </h2><p>The NBA said in a statement that it is reviewing the indictments and cooperating with investigators. </p><p>"Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups are being placed on immediate leave from their teams, and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities," the league said.</p><p>Prosecutors noted in the court filing, "The charges in the indictments are allegations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty."</p>
<p>An attorney for Billups called him "a man of integrity" and said he intends to fight the charges. "To believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his hall-of-fame legacy, his reputation, and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game," the attorney, Chris Heywood, said in a statement, adding, "We look forward to our day in court."</p><p>Rozier's attorney, James Trusty, said Rozier had previously been characterized by prosecutors "as a subject, not a target" of the probe. </p><p>"It is unfortunate that instead of allowing him to self surrender they opted for a photo op. They wanted the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk. That tells you a lot about the motivations in this case," Trusty said in a statement. "They appear to be taking the word of spectacularly in-credible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing. Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case. Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight."</p>

<p>An NBA Hall of Famer, a current star and former player are among dozens of people arrested Thursday in a sweeping FBI crackdown on <span class="link">alleged illegal gambling rings</span>.</p><p>Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier and Damon Jones, each mainstays of professional basketball for years, were indicted alongside more than 30 other suspects who include alleged members of prominent organized crime families.</p><p>The NBA said in a statement that Rozier and Billups were being put on leave and that the league is cooperating with authorities. Jones is not currently employed by the league.</p><p>One of the federal cases unveiled Thursday involves allegations of cheating in high-stakes poker games operated by mafia figures. The <span class="link">elaborate cheating scheme</span> netted more than $7 million from rigged games, prosecutors said.The other case revolves around bets on basketball games, which were allegedly placed using insider information related to injury reports.</p><p><span class="link">Jones</span> is among three people arrested in connection with both schemes. In total, 34 people were charged across two indictments. Here's a look at who's who in the case:</p>
<h2>Chauncey Billups</h2>
<p>Billups, the 49-year-old head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball <span class="link">Hall of Fame in 2024</span>. His 17-year NBA playing career included a championship with the 2004 Detroit Pistons, as well as stints with the Boston Celtics, Denver Nuggets, LA Clippers and other teams. </p><p>The poker ring indictment alleges that wealthy people were invited to "rigged games" with well-known former professional athletes, known as "face cards," who received a portion of proceeds from "cheating teams." </p><p>One such game, in April 2019 in Las Vegas, allegedly involved both Billups and Jones and used a device described as a "rigged shuffling machine" that was secretly altered to read the cards. The FBI said a victim was defrauded of $50,000 in that game.</p><p>An attorney for Billups disputed the charges. "To believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his hall-of-fame legacy, his reputation, and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game," the attorney, Chris Heywood, said in a statement. "He will fight these allegations with the same tenacity that marked his 28-year career. We look forward to our day in court."</p>
<h2>Terry Rozier</h2>
<p>The only current player in the indictments, <span class="link">Rozier</span> is a 31-year-old guard for the Miami Heat, nicknamed "Scary Terry" and, according to the FBI indictment, "Chum."</p><p>Rozier is one of six people charged in the sports betting case. </p><p>The indictment highlights a March 23, 2023, game involving the Charlotte Hornets, who Rozier played for at the time. Rozier allegedly told a "longtime friend" he would leave the game early, claiming to be injured. The indictment accuses Rozier of providing that information so that his friend could place bets that predicted Rozier would underperform during the game, known as betting on his "unders." Rozier stopped playing that night after nine minutes. His friend, Deniro Laster, and two others, who are also charged, allegedly placed "more than $200,000 in wagers predicting Rozier's "under" statistics," officials said.</p><p>An attorney for Rozier, James Trusty, said prosecutors "appear to be taking the word of spectacularly in-credible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing. Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case. Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight."</p><p>The NBA said in a statement Thursday, "We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority."</p><h2>Damon Jones</h2><p>Jones, a former NBA player and coach who now lives in Texas, is accused of participating in the poker scheme as a "face card" and member of the "cheating teams," according to the indictment in that case.</p><p>The former Cleveland Cavaliers guard is also accused in the sports betting case of attempting to give inside information to bettors on "a prominent NBA player," who appears to be LeBron James based on the description of a particular Lakers game. The superstar and Jones played on the Cavaliers together nearly two decades ago. James is not accused of any wrongdoing.</p>
<h2>Ernest Aiello</h2><p>Aiello, of Wantagh, New York, is described in the poker indictment as "a member of the Bonanno Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra."</p>

<div class="article-title">Miami Heat's Terry Rozier charged in illegal sports betting case, FBI says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was arrested early Thursday morning in Orlando and charged in a <span class="link">federal sports betting and money laundering case</span> that prosecutors say involved using nonpublic information about NBA players and injuries to place illegal wagers.</p><p>U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Joseph Nocella said Rozier is one of six defendants in the first of two large-scale federal cases, both tied to an overlapping network of illegal gambling and organized crime.</p><p>"Your winning streak has ended," Nocella said during a Thursday morning news conference. "Violating the law is a losing proposition."</p><p>Later in the day, Rozier walked out of jail after posting his Florida home as a $6 million bond. </p>
<h2>Rozier charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering</h2><p>According to Nocella, Rozier and others are accused of defrauding sportsbooks by using confidential, nonpublic information about when certain NBA players would sit out games or withdraw due to injuries. Prosecutors said the group used that information to gain an unfair advantage in placing bets.</p>
<p>Rozier is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p><p>FBI Director Kash Patel described the first case as a "wide-sweeping criminal enterprise" that blurred the lines between the NBA and organized crime.</p><p>"This is an illegal gambling and rigging operation that spanned the course of years," Patel said. "This fraud is historic in its scheme."</p><p>Rozier's attorney, James Trusty, criticized the handling of the arrest, saying his client had cooperated with authorities and should have been allowed to surrender voluntarily. Trusty said prosecutors had previously described Rozier as a "subject, not a target," and accused them of seeking publicity instead of fairness.</p>
<p>"They wanted the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk," Trusty said. "That tells you a lot about the motivations in this case."</p><p>Trusty added that Rozier was cleared by the NBA in an earlier review and "looks forward to winning this fight."</p><p>Rozier's arrest came just hours <span class="link">after the Heat's season-opening game Wednesday night against the Orlando Magic</span>, a game he did not play in despite being listed on the active roster. Rozier was arrested by federal authorities at a Orlando hotel.</p><p>Team officials and Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra have not commented publicly on Rozier's arrest.</p><p>Former NBA player <span class="link">Damon Jones</span>, who played for the Miami Heat in 2004, was also arrested in connection to the sports betting charges investigation.</p><h2>Second case tied to New York organized crime families</h2><p>In a separate but related case, 31 defendants were charged with running illegal, high-stakes poker games that federal agents say were fixed using technology to manipulate outcomes.</p><p>Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups was arrested in connection to this case, authorities confirmed.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the operation stretched from New York to Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Miami and involved members of the Bonanno, Gambino, and Genovese crime families, who previously controlled other underground gambling networks in New York.</p><p>Thirteen alleged mob associates were charged in connection with that scheme.</p><p>Nocella said three people, including Jones, overlap between the two cases, bringing the total number of defendants to 34 nationwide.</p><h2>Rozier and Billups put on leave during the investigation, NBA says</h2><p>The NBA said in a statement that Rozier and Billups were being put on leave as the league cooperates with authorities. </p><p>"We are in the process of reviewing the federal indictments announced today," the league said in a statement. "Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups are being placed on immediate leave from their teams, and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities. We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority."</p>
<p>Earlier this year in a separate case, former NBA player Gilbert Arenas was <span class="link">arrested</span> for allegedly operating an illegal gambling and poker ring out of a California home that he owned.</p><h2>Rozier's rise with the Boston Celtics</h2><p>Before joining Miami, Rozier spent four seasons with the Boston Celtics, where he built a reputation as a tenacious defender and clutch playoff performer. </p>
<p>Drafted by Boston in 2015, he became a breakout player in the 2017-18 postseason, averaging 16.5 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 5.7 assists while helping lead the team to the Eastern Conference Finals.</p><p>Rozier later played four and a half seasons with the Charlotte Hornets, averaging more than 19 points per game before being traded to the Miami Heat in early 2024.</p><p>According to earlier reporting from ESPN and CBS Sports, federal investigators had been examining unusual betting activity linked to a March 2023 game when Rozier played for the Charlotte Hornets, including heavy wagers on his player stats. At the time, the NBA said it found no evidence that Rozier violated league rules.</p>

<div class="article-title">Letitia James blasts prosecutor in criminal case for conversation with journalist</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Attorneys for New York Attorney General Letitia James took aim at the Trump-appointed prosecutor overseeing her bank fraud case Thursday, accusing interim U.S. attorney Lindsey Halligan of an improper conversation with a journalist and vowing to seek dismissal of the indictment on the grounds that <span class="link">Halligan</span> was unlawfully named to the job.</p><p>The pair of legal filings came the evening before James is set to be arraigned Friday in federal court in Norfolk, Virginia, on <span class="link">charges</span> of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. Prosecutors allege that James bought a house in Virginia and agreed to use it as a second home, but ultimately rented it out and used it as an investment property.</p><p>James has denied all wrongdoing and accused the Justice Department of political retribution, after James sued President Trump in civil court and <span class="link">secured a nine-figure fraud judgment</span>. The fine <span class="link">was later erased</span> entirely by an appeals court.</p><h2>James to challenge Halligan's appointment</h2><p>In a two-page legal filing, James's lawyers alerted the court that they will file a motion Friday "to dismiss the indictment that challenges the unlawful appointment of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan."</p><p>The filing did not lay out the argument her lawyers plan to offer.</p>
<p>Lawyers for former FBI Director James Comey also challenged Halligan's appointment earlier this week, <span class="link">arguing the charges against him</span> for allegedly lying to Congress should be tossed out on the grounds that she was "defectively appointed to her office."</p><p>Halligan was appointed after the previous interim U.S. attorney, Erik Siebert, resigned after almost eight months on the job. The role is usually subject to a 120-day limit, but in Siebert's case, the judges in the Eastern District of Virginia voted to extend his term after the 120-day period elapsed. Comey's lawyers argue the 120-day clock began when Siebert started in January, making Halligan's appointment invalid.</p><p>Several other temporary U.S. attorneys have faced similar challenges to their eligibility in recent months, including the top federal prosecutors in <span class="link">New Jersey</span> and <span class="link">Nevada</span>.</p><h2>James alleges Halligan broke Justice Department rules by speaking with reporter</h2><p>James also asked a judge Thursday to prohibit the Justice Department from disclosing case materials and investigative information to the media, in a court filing that criticized Halligan for texting a journalist last weekend to criticize coverage of the case.</p>
<p>Anna Bower, a senior editor at Lawfare, wrote earlier this week that Halligan sent her unsolicited messages on the encrypted app Signal that criticized her for sharing a New York Times article about the James case on social media. Bower says Halligan accused her of "jumping to conclusions" and sharing "biased" information that was "way off."</p><p>"You're biased. Your reporting isn't accurate. I'm the one handling the case and I'm telling you that," one message from Halligan read, according to Bower.</p><p>In Thursday's filing, James's lawyers called Halligan's messages to Bower "unusual and improper," and "a stunning disclosure of internal government information."</p><p>They argued the conversation violated court rules and internal Justice Department policies that bar the sharing of grand jury information and restrict prosecutors' out-of-court statements. By casting doubt on the accuracy of the Times article, James' lawyers said, Halligan was "commenting on the evidence in the case and that which she likely learned as a result of grand jury testimony."</p><p>This disclosure could undermine James's right to a fair trial, her lawyers claimed.</p><p>"It has been reported that Ms. Halligan has no prosecutorial experience whatsoever," the filing read. "But all federal prosecutors are required to know and follow the rules governing their conduct from their first day on the job, and so any lack of experience cannot excuse their violation."</p><p>CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has faced similar pressure in other cases. </p><p>Last month, attorneys for accused UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione asked a judge to bar <span class="link">federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty</span>, accusing federal and New York authorities of violating his rights. They pointed to statements by Attorney General Pam Bondi calling the killing a "premeditated, cold-blooded assassination," and criticized a late 2024 perp walk staged by federal and local authorities that looked like a "scene out of a Marvel movie."</p>

<div class="article-title">NBA's Rozier and Billups among dozens of arrests in illegal betting probe</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Dozens of people including former and current NBA players and a coach have been charged in connection to two investigations into an alleged widespread sports betting scheme and organized crime ring, the FBI and federal prosecutors announced Thursday. </p><p>Among those taken into custody were Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and <span class="link">Terry Rozier</span>, who has played for the Miami Heat since 2024. Billups, a former star guard and <span class="link">Hall of Famer</span> from Denver who played for multiple NBA teams<strong>,</strong> was arrested in Portland, Oregon, and Rozier was arrested in Orlando. </p><p>The NBA said in a statement that Rozier and Billups were put on leave and that the league is cooperating with authorities. </p><p><span class="link">The arrests</span> are in relation to two federal criminal cases. One involves a sports betting ring involving former and current NBA players, including some who allegedly faked injuries. The other case involves <span class="link">illegal high-stakes poker games</span> involving coaches and operated by organized crime figures. Three people, including former NBA player <span class="link">Damon Jones</span>, were arrested in connection to both schemes, the U.S. attorney's office said. </p><p>Thirty-one people are being charged in the poker case, and some of those defendants are allegedly connected to organized crime families known to law enforcement, prosecutors said. Rozier was among the six arrested in connection with the sports betting case, while Billups was one of those arrested in connection to the poker case. </p>
<p>FBI Director Kash Patel said the charges and the arrests in both cases include wire fraud, money laundering, extortion, robbery and illegal gambling. </p><p>Patel called the arrests "extraordinary," saying that they stemmed from a "coordinated takedown across 11 states." </p><p>"Not only did we crack into the fraud that these perpetrators committed on the grand stage of the NBA, but we have also interred and executed a system of justice against La Cosa Nostra to include the Bonanno, Gambino, Genovese and Lucchese crime families," Patel said. </p><p>Joseph Nocella, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said the defendants allegedly used a "variety of very sophisticated cheating technologies," including self-shuffling machines that had been secretly altered to read the cards in the deck and predict which player at the table had the best poker hand, which was then allegedly sent to an off-site operator. The off-site operator then allegedly sent the information via cellphone to the co-conspirator at the table, who was known as the quarterback. The quarterback then allegedly secretly signaled the information to others and at the table, and together, they used that information to win the games, Nocella said. </p>
<p>Nocella said that in the first case that allegedly involves Rozier, the defendants are accused of having profited off of games played by the Charlotte Hornets, Portland Trail Blazers, L.A. Lakers and Toronto Raptors. The defendants allegedly used non-public information to place bets of hundreds of thousands of dollars, mostly in the form of prop bets on individual player performance in games, Nocella said.</p><p>"Most of these bets succeeded, and the intended losses were in the hundreds of millions of dollars," Nocella said. "The defendants then laundered their illegal winnings in various ways — peer-to-peer platforms, bank wires and simple cash exchanges." </p><p>According to the sports betting indictment, between 2022 and 2024, co-conspirators, allegedly including Rozier, provided private information only known to some in the NBA to others in exchange for flat fees or cuts of the bet profits. </p><p>In one NBA game in March 2023, when Rozier was a player on the Charlotte Hornets, he allegedly told a co-conspirator that he was going to "prematurely remove himself from the game in the first quarter due to a supposed injury." That co-conspirator sold that information for $100,000 from expected winnings to another defendant, prosecutors said. Shane Hennen, one of the defendants, is accused of placing multiple bets at a sportsbook totalling about $61,200 on Rozier to not eclipse his projected scoring and playing lines in the game. Another co-conspirator allegedly placed bets totalling about $107,000 on the same thing, alongside others who did the same in the gambling ring. </p><p>Federal prosecutors said that NBA and team officials were not aware of his injury or plan to leave the game early, and Rozier left the game early.</p><p>Another game from March of 2023, the betting circle got access to information that an unnamed player was going to sit out a game while playing for the Portland Trail Blazers because the team was tanking, or intentionally losing, to get a better draft pick in the upcoming draft, the indictment says. The group also allegedly acquired access to information that the Orlando Magic were going to sit their best players in an April 2023 game as well. In both cases, prosecutors allege that the gambling circle bet on those teams to lose and win bets because of the information they had. In both cases, the players did indeed sit out the games.</p><p>According to the same indictment, Damon Jones attempted to give inside information to bettors on a prominent NBA player, who appears to be LeBron James, who he played with as a Cleveland Cavalier, and another prominent player. In two games, one in February 2023 and another in January 2024, Jones allegedly sold or attempted to sell non-public information about the players' injuries to bettors. In the 2023 game, Jones is alleged to have shared information about James' injury status to bettors before a game against the Milwaukee Bucks, telling a co-conspirator over text that James was going to be out of the game before it was publicly announced. James did not play in that game and the Lakers lost. </p>
<p>Rozier's attorney, James Trusty, sent a statement to CBS News saying that Rozier had been characterized as a subject, not a target, of investigators, but then "at 6 a.m. this morning they called to tell me FBI agents were trying to arrest him in a hotel." Trusty accused federal prosecutors of wanting "the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk."</p><p>Billups had a brief appearance in Oregon federal court Thursday afternoon and was released after agreeing to certain conditions.</p><p>According to the poker game indictment, the rigged games were set up at various locations in New York City and on Long Island, in addition to Las Vegas and Miami. In one poker scheme in New York City, a victim was allegedly defrauded over $1.8 million by the crime ring. Prosecutors allege that from the conception of the poker scheme to the present, victims were defrauded of over $7.15 million. </p><p>Billups, federal prosecutors said, was allegedly involved in defrauding victims of over $50,000.</p><p>To hide the earnings from the scheme, the co-conspirators allegedly laundered their money through shell companies and third-parties, and payments were provided in cash or other forms of payment like cryptocurrency. </p><p>According to a detention letter sent to the New York judge who is overseeing the case, the Justice Department is not moving to detain Billups as his case moves forward. It was requested, however, that 13 defendants be detained.</p><p>In a statement provided to CBS News Thursday night, an attorney for Billups wrote that "to believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his hall-of-fame legacy, his reputation, and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game. Billups has never and would never gamble on basketball games, provide insider information, or sacrifice the trust of his team and the League, as it would tarnish the game he has devoted his entire life to."</p>
<p>Nocella said the investigation does not involve college basketball, and added that the investigation is still ongoing. </p><p>This is not the first high-profile incident involving alleged illegal betting and the NBA. Earlier this year in a separate case, former NBA player Gilbert Arenas was <span class="link">arrested</span> for allegedly operating an illegal gambling and poker ring out of a California home that he owned. </p>

<div class="article-title">Maps show how redistricting could affect congressional seats</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>North Carolina is now the latest state to join a mid-decade redistricting gambit that could shake up next year's midterms, following similar moves by Missouri, Texas and California to redraw their House maps, along with a separate court-ordered effort in Utah.</p><p>The redistricting push began with President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to find more seats. <span class="link">Texas Gov. Greg Abbott</span> signed legislation in August to <span class="link">redraw the state's districts</span> and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a push that has drawn national attention. It led to California <span class="link">Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign</span> to redraw the map to help Democrats.</p><p>Then, in Missouri, state lawmakers <span class="link">redrew</span> their map earlier this month to edge out Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, signed the legislation on Sunday. In October, <span class="link">North Carolina Republicans targeted</span> a single Democratic district as well, passing a map that redraws the 1st Congressional District to make it lean more heavily Republican. </p><p>Utah lawmakers have also reworked their state's map after a judge ruled the current districts violated restrictions on gerrymandering. All four of the state's House districts are represented by Republicans.</p><p>Challenges remain in all states. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Kehoe's authority to create the new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Civil rights groups are also <span class="link">suing</span> in Texas, claiming the maps are racially biased. And in California, the state's new map must be approved by voters in a November special election before it takes effect.</p>
<p>Congressional maps are <span class="link">normally redrawn every 10 years</span> after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain — or even expand — their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.</p><p>Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, <span class="link">Texas Democrats fled the state</span> to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor. </p><p>The <span class="link">Democrats ultimately returned</span> after two weeks, and the <span class="link">legislation was passed</span>, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.</p><p>Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, includingIndiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats. </p>
<p>Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.</p><p>"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it — I think it's fair to say — in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads," said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice. </p><p>Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it "folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly … a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before." </p><h2>See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:</h2><p>Texas has 38 congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats. </p><p>Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains here in the past few years. </p><p>In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats. </p><p>Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's  district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district. </p>
<p>Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that <span class="link">he would not seek reelection</span> if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin. </p><p>California has 52 House representatives, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats. </p><p>In 2020, Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. They've held two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley. </p><p>Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.</p><p>In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps. </p><p>In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.</p><p>Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.</p>
<p>After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.</p>
<p>As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the "7 to 1 map" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts. </p><p>Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.</p><p>The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican. </p><p>By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County. </p>
<p>North Carolina has 14 congressional seats, 10 of which are held by Republicans. But the state is not as solidly red as that breakdown would suggest — it's closer to a 50/50 state at the presidential level these days, and the state's governor and attorney general are both Democrats.</p><p>In the redistricting push undertaken this fall, North Carolina Republicans are targeting a single seat: Rep. Don Davis' 1st Congressional District. Davis' win in 2024 in the northeastern part of the state was a rare bright spot for Democrats, especially after Republicans were able to flip congressional three seats in North Carolina that year.</p><p>In the map passed by the North Carolina Assembly on Oct. 21 and 22, Davis' district boundaries move further south, into the current 3rd District. That changes the makeup of the district from one that was 48% Democratic to one that is 44% Democratic. </p>
<h2>Utah redistricting </h2>
<p>Utah's redistricting is different from the other states' campaigns, starting with the fact that the state does not have any Democratic members of Congress. The redistricting push also wasn't kicked off by Mr. Trump and Republicans or in retaliation for moves by other states. Utah's 2025 redistricting was put in motion this summer when a judge ruled the current districts were in violation of a voter-approved measure to prevent partisan gerrymandering.</p><p>The GOP-controlled legislature put forward four maps for public comment, and ultimately on Oct. 6 approved a map that would be the least competitive for Democrats. It will still need a judge's final seal of approval.</p><p><strong>The only blue-leaning area of Utah, Salt Lake County, was split into three districts in the maps approved in 2021. But the proposed map will split Salt Lake County into two districts, speading out making Districts 2 and 3 more competitive for Democrats.</strong></p><p>But as University of Utah professor Matthew Burbank pointed out in an interview with CBS News, "however the lines are drawn, Republicans are not likely to lose a whole lot of seats." Burbank said if the 2026 election is really competitive in Utah, it will likely have more to do with Mr. Trump.</p><p>"The state is, at the moment, a little uncertain, not because Democrats have really done anything to make themselves more competitive," Burbank said. "It's really been on the Republican side. There is a bit of a split … this was a state in 2016, a heavily Republican state but clearly not a pro-Trump state." </p><p>While Mr. Trump won Utah in 2016, it was not by the margins that would be expected in such a red state. But in 2024, Mr. Trump did better in the state and other elected officials in the state seemed to have adjusted to be more pro-Trump — something that could cause backlash with voters in 2026. </p>

<div class="article-title">Semi truck driver arrested in deadly 10 Freeway crash was in U.S. illegally, DHS says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents filed an arrest detainer for a semi-truck driver who was arrested for driving under the influence following a <span class="link">deadly crash on the 10 Freeway</span> in Ontario, California.</p><p>ICE told CBS News that 21-year-old Jashanpreet Singh is an Indian national who entered the country by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in 2022. He is a resident of Yuba City, California, which is located in Sutter County, about 120 miles northeast of San Francisco. </p><p>However, California transportation officials said the federal government approved Singh's Employment Authorization Documents, which allowed him to receive a federal REAL ID that confirmed his legal status. The federal government extended its legal employment from April 24, 2025, to Oct. 16, 2026, and then again to Aug. 18, 2030, according to state officials. </p><p>"The state does not determine commercial driver's license eligibility," the California State Transportation Agency wrote in a post to X."The FEDERAL government approves and renews all FEDERAL employment authorization documents that allows individuals to work and obtain commercial driver's licenses."</p><p>CBS LA reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for clarification.</p>
<p>Singh was arrested on Tuesday by California Highway Patrol officers in connection with an eight-vehicle collision that included four commercial vehicles. The crash left three people dead and four others hospitalized in varying conditions. All of the victims were adults, Ontario Fire Department crews said. </p>
<p>San Bernardino County jail records show that Singh remains detained on Wednesday night at the West Valley Detention Center in San Bernardino without bail. He has been charged with driving under the influence of drugs, causing bodily injury, and gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated. He's expected in court on Friday at the Rancho Superior Court in Rancho Cucamonga. </p><p>CBS Sacramento reporters spoke with Singh's best friend, Gurjot Malhar, on Wednesday evening. He told them that Singh came to the U.S. in search of a better life. </p><p>"He's an amazing guy. ... He would talk normally, happily, always with love and care," Malhar said. "Coming from India, it's gonna be hard to make dollars here. ... So, he wanted to keep going."</p>
<p>It's unclear if Singh currently has legal representation. CHP officers told CBS LA that they were investigating whether Singh was driving with a valid commercial driver's license at the time of the crash.</p><p>In August, the U.S. government stopped issuing <span class="link">worker visas for commercial truck drivers</span>. At the time, a State Department spokesperson said that the pause was put in place "in order to conduct a comprehensive and thorough review of screening and vetting protocols used to determine the qualifications for a U.S. visa."</p><p>"As we have seen with recent deadly accidents, foreign truckers can pose risks to American lives, U.S. national security, and foreign policy interests," the State Department spokesperson said. "Ensuring that every driver on our roads meets the highest standards is important to protecting the livelihoods of American truckers and maintaining a secure, resilient supply chain."</p>
<p>California and Washington were <span class="link">sued by Florida</span> last week for a crash that happened in August that left three people dead after the driver of a semi-truck attempted to perform an illegal U-turn on the Florida Turnpike in St. Lucie County. The driver in that crash, Harjinder Singh, also entered the U.S. illegally and obtained a commercial driver's license from California, U.S. Marshals <span class="link">told CBS News Miami</span> in September.</p><p>The lawsuit alleges that both states have failed to comply with federal safety and immigration-status requirements when issuing commercial driver's licenses. The suit says that California and Washington "chose to ignore these standards and authorize illegal immigrants without proper training or the ability to read road signs to drive commercial motor vehicles."</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Roanoke, Virginia</em> — As a 10-year-old, Autumn Bushman loved to perform. The fourth-grade cheerleader from Salem, Virginia, was a bundle of energy. </p><p>"She really turned my living room into a dance floor," her mother, Summer Bushman, told CBS News. "She never sat still...She really did care about others more than she cared about herself." </p><p>But for the past couple of years, Summer says Autumn was bullied in school over her braces. The abuse also continued after school on her smartphone.</p><p>On March 21, at the age of 10, Autumn died by suicide at night in her bedroom. Records show she was looking at her phone's screen just before it happened, Summer said. </p><p>Summer told CBS News her daughter would take her phone to bed at night.</p>
<p>"I had questioned that a couple of times, and she fought back and said, 'Mom, I need my alarm,'" Summer said. "And every single morning when I'd wake her up, she had her alarm going off."</p><p>A new study from researchers at Virginia Tech shows nighttime screen use and easy access to over-the-counter medicines are linked to teen suicide attempts. </p><p>The study examined data of children ages 12 to 17 who had been admitted to a hospital after attempting suicide by intentionally overdosing. It found that about two-thirds of those overdosed after 8 p.m., and approximately three out of four were on screens right before. </p><p>"It is very distracting and disturbs your sleep," Dr. Abhishek Reddy, a clinical psychiatrist and professor at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine who conducted the research, said of screen use before bed. </p>
<p>Reddy added that it is "pretty dangerous" for bullied children to take their phones to bed at night "because during the daytime, you can talk to people, you can talk to school counselors, you can talk to your family members, friends. But at nighttime, all that access is cut off."</p><p>He recommends keeping phones out of bedrooms, practicing good sleep hygiene, and reducing access to all medications.</p><p>"I come in here and I think, you know, it's been six months since she's been gone, it's been seven months since she's been gone.

<div class="article-title">Alabama executes man with nitrogen gas for 1993 murder over $200 drug debt</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>An <span class="link">Alabama man convicted of helping to burn a man alive</span> in 1993 over a $200 drug debt was executed by nitrogen gas on Thursday.</p><p>Anthony Boyd, 54, was pronounced dead at 6:33 p.m. local time at William C. Holman Correctional Facility, authorities said. The execution was carried out by nitrogen gas, a controversial method Alabama began using last year. Alabama <span class="link">tested the method for the first time</span> on a condemned inmate in January 2024.</p><p>Boyd was sentenced to death for his role in killing Gregory Huguley in Talladega County. Prosecutors said Huguley was set on fire after he didn't pay for $200 worth of cocaine.</p>
<p>Boyd used his final words to proclaim his innocence and criticize the criminal justice system. </p><p>"I didn't kill anybody. I didn't participate in killing anybody," he said. "There can be no justice until we change this system," he continued, before closing with, "Let's get it."</p><p>The execution appeared to take longer than prior nitrogen gas executions. The state does not reveal the exact time the gas began flowing. </p>
<p>At about 5:57 p.m., Boyd clenched his fist, raised his head off the gurney slightly and began shaking. He then raised his legs off the gurney several inches. At about 6:01 p.m., those movements stopped, and he began a series of heaving breaths that lasted at least 15 minutes before becoming still.</p><p>On Thursday, Boyd had nine visitors, two phone calls, accepted his breakfast, refused his lunch and dinner, and declined a final meal request, the Alabama Department of Corrections said in a news release.</p><p>Boyd <span class="link">requested to meet with Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey</span>, during a news conference on Wednesday hosted by the Execution Intervention Project and his spiritual adviser, the Rev. Jeff Hood. Boyd said in a recorded message that the governor should "come sit down" with him and "have a conversation with the guy you deemed one of the worst of the worst." </p><p>A prosecution witness at Boyd's trial testified as part of a plea agreement and said that Boyd taped Huguley's feet together before another man doused him in gasoline and set him on fire. Defense lawyers said he was at a party on the night Huguley was killed.</p>
<p>A jury convicted Boyd of capital murder during a kidnapping and recommended by a vote of 10-2 that he receive a death sentence. </p><p>Boyd had been on Alabama's death row since 1995. He was the latest chair of Project Hope to Abolish the Death Penalty, an anti-death penalty group founded by men on death row. </p><p>Alabama began using nitrogen gas last year to carry out some executions. The method uses a gas mask strapped over the inmate's face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing the person to die from lack of oxygen.</p><p>Nationally, the method has now been used in eight executions: seven times in Alabama and once in Louisiana. </p><p>Boyd's lawyers had asked a federal judge to halt the execution to give the method more scrutiny. A federal judge declined the request. She ruled Boyd was unlikely to prevail on claims that the method, which has been used multiple times, is unconstitutionally cruel.</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday afternoon also denied Boyd's request to stay the execution and instead let him die by firing squad. Justice Sonia Sotomayor authored a scathing dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.</p><p>Sotomayor, citing witness description of past nitrogen gas executions, wrote that there is "mounting and unbroken evidence" that the method is unconstitutional. She wrote that "allowing the nitrogen hypoxia experiment to continue" fails to protect the dignity of the nation. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, Boyd <span class="link">pushed for execution</span> by firing squad, hanging or medical-aid-in-dying instead, arguing nitrogen hypoxia is unconstitutionally cruel. </p><p>Alabama has maintained that any shaking or gasping exhibited by inmates during nitrogen gas executions are largely involuntary actions caused by oxygen deprivation.</p>

<div class="article-title">White House demolishes East Wing as Trump says he'll donate "millions" to ballroom</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington</em> — The entire White House East Wing appears to have been demolished, new images show, after the White House said President Trump doesn't need to seek approval to tear it down. </p><p>Photos taken Thursday and a new satellite image from Planet Labs PBC show some rubble where the East Wing used to stand, after <span class="link">demolition</span> of the structure only began earlier this week. </p>
<p>The president on Thursday said he plans to give "millions of dollars" of his own money to the project, but he declined to offer a specific figure when he was asked about it by reporters.</p><p>The move to raze the <span class="link">East Wing</span> — as well as the rapidity of its <span class="link">destruction</span> — came as a surprise to many, after the president had previously said in July the current White House structure would be untouched. </p><p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday that the president doesn't need approval for demolition — only for "vertical construction" —  citing a previous legal opinion from the National Capital Planning Commission. The commission is a federal agency that provides planning policies and reviews of development proposals aimed at preserving the architecture of the nation's capital, although its operations have been affected by the ongoing government shutdown. It has no authority to stop the ballroom project.</p>
<p>"Their general counsel has said when it comes to Phase 1 of this project, the tearing down of the current East Wing structure, a submission is not required legally for that," Leavitt said. "Only for vertical construction will a submission be required, and that's a legal opinion from them, and we are following that legal opinion."</p>
<p>Leavitt said the legal opinion that the president can demolish parts of the White House without approval is one the planning commission has held for many years. CBS News has requested the legal opinion she cited.</p><p>She also maintained the White House has been "transparent" about the ballroom project. </p><p>"The president has been incredibly transparent," Leavitt said Thursday. "I would reject any notion otherwise, when it comes to this ballroom project."</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said the ballroom, which he says is entirely <span class="link">privately funded</span>, would cost $300 million, up from the $200 million figure White House officials initially cited. On Thursday, he repeated that the price tag would be "in the neighborhood" of $300 million and added that the donations have exceeded its cost — estimating "I think $350 million" in donations so far. </p>
<p>The White House has also mentioned other presidents who undertook major construction projects at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and published a timeline that trolls some of Mr. Trump's Democratic predecessors. </p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington </em>— Former special counsel Jack Smith is offering to testify in open hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees about the federal investigations into President Trump's handling of sensitive documents and alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, according to a letter from his lawyers to lawmakers.</p><p>In the letter obtained by CBS News, Smith's lawyers said he is prepared to answer questions from Congress about the investigations he oversaw and prosecutions of Mr. Trump that stemmed from them, but said doing so "requires assurance from the Department of Justice that he will not be punished for doing so."</p><p>Lawyers Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski said Smith needs guidance from the Justice Department about federal grand jury secrecy requirements and authorization as to the issues he can speak about, including the second volume of his final report, which he completed before leaving the role of special counsel. The <span class="link">first volume of Smith's report</span> pertains to the investigation that stemmed from alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and it was submitted to Congress in mid-January. But the second volume, which covers Mr. Trump's handling of sensitive government documents after leaving the White House in 2021, has not been made public.</p><p>Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland said in January that he would not release the second volume of Smith's final report because a criminal case involving two of Mr. Trump's co-defendants was ongoing. But after Mr. Trump returned to the White House for a second term, the case against the two, aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira, <span class="link">was tossed out.</span></p><p><span class="link">Both</span> <span class="link">cases</span> against Mr. Trump arising from Smith's investigations ended after he won the presidential election last November.</p>
<p>"Given the many mischaracterizations of Mr. Smith's investigation into President Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and role in attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election, Mr. Smith respectfully requests the opportunity to testify in open hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees," Smith's lawyers wrote in their letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley and Rep. Jim Jordan, who lead the Senate and House Judiciary panels.</p><p>They said that Smith "steadfastly adhered to established legal standards and Department of Justice guidelines, consistent with his approach throughout his career as a dedicated public servant," while leading the investigations into Mr. Trump.</p><p>Smith and his team brought two criminal cases against the president in 2023. In the first, prosecutors <span class="link">alleged that Mr. Trump illegally held onto</span> documents marked classified after the end of his first term in January 2021 and kept them at his South Florida property, Mar-a-Lago. He faced 40 counts in all and pleaded not guilty.</p><p>The second case involved his <span class="link">alleged efforts to hold onto power</span> after he lost the 2020 presidential election to former President Joe Biden. Mr. Trump faced four charges and pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>The president and his allies in Congress have long accused Smith of pursuing politically motivated cases against Mr. Trump in an effort to undermine his candidacy for a second term. Smith resigned from the Justice Department before Mr. Trump was inaugurated, but is the subject of <span class="link">investigations</span> from congressional Republicans and the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency that is unrelated to Smith's former position of special counsel.</p><p>Smith's lawyers <span class="link">called the ethics probe</span> by the Office of the Special Counsel "imaginary and unfounded."</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump says he's ending trade talks with Canada over TV ads</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said late Thursday that he was ending "all trade negotiations" with Canada because of a television ad opposing U.S. tariffs that he said misstated the facts and called "egregious behavior" aimed at influencing U.S. court decisions.</p>
<p>The post on Trump's social media site came after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he aims to double his country's exports to countries outside the U.S. because of the threat posed by Trump's tariffs. Trump's call for an abrupt end to negotiations could further inflame trade tensions that already have been building between the two neighboring countries for months.</p> <p>Trump posted, "The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs."</p>
<p>"The ad was for $75,000. They only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts," Trump wrote on his social media site. "TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED."</p> <p>Carney's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The prime minister was set to leave Friday morning for a summit in Asia, while Trump is set to do the same Friday evening.</p> <p>Earlier Thursday night, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute posted on X that an ad created by the government of Ontario "misrepresents the 'Presidential Radio Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade' dated April 25, 1987." It added that Ontario did not receive foundation permission "to use and edit the remarks."</p> <p>The foundation said it is "reviewing legal options in this matter" and invited the public to watch the unedited video of Reagan's address.</p> <p>Carney met with Trump earlier this month to try to ease trade tensions, as the two countries and Mexico prepare for a review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement — a trade deal Trump negotiated in his first term, but has since soured on.</p>
<p>More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.</p> <p>Trump said earlier this week that he had seen the ad on television and said that it showed that his tariffs were having an impact.</p> <p>"I saw an ad last night from Canada. If I was Canada, I'd take that same ad also," he said then.</p> <p>In his own post on X last week, Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, posted a link to the ad and the message: "It's official: Ontario's new advertising campaign in the U.S. has launched."</p>
<p>He continued, "Using every tool we have, we'll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada. The way to prosperity is by working together."</p> <p>A spokesperson for Ford didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night. But Ford previously got Trump's attention with an electricity surcharge to U.S. states. Trump responded by doubling steel and aluminum tariffs.</p> <p>The president has moved to impose steep U.S. tariffs on many goods from Canada. In April, Canada's government imposed retaliatory levies on certain U.S. goods -- but it carved out exemptions for some automakers to bring specific numbers of vehicles into the country, known as remission quotas.</p>
<p>Trump's tariffs have especially hurt Canada's auto sector, much of which is based in Ontario. This month, Stellantis said it would move a production line from Ontario to Illinois.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>

<p>JUNEAU, Alaska — The Trump administration on Thursday finalized plans to open the coastal plain of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to potential oil and gas drilling, renewing a long-simmering debate over whether to drill in one of the nation's environmental jewels.</p> <p>U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced the decision Thursday that paves the way for future lease sales within the refuge's 1.5 million-acre ( 631,309 hectare) coastal plain, an area that's considered sacred by the Indigenous Gwich'in. The plan fulfills pledges made by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to reopen this portion of the refuge to possible development. Trump's bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, passed during the summer, called for at least four lease sales within the refuge over a 10-year period.</p>
<p>Burgum was joined in Washington, D.C., by Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state's congressional delegation for this and other lands-related announcements, including the department's decision to restore oil and gas leases in the refuge that had been canceled by the prior administration.</p> <p>A federal judge in March said the Biden administration lacked authority to cancel the leases, which were held by a state corporation that was the major bidder in the first-ever lease sale for the refuge held at the end of Trump's first term.</p> <p>Leaders in Indigenous Gwich'in communities near the refuge consider the coastal plain sacred, noting its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon, and they oppose drilling there. Leaders of Kaktovik, an Iñupiaq community within the refuge, support drilling and consider responsible oil development to be key to their region's economic well-being.</p>
<p>"It is encouraging to see decisionmakers in Washington advancing policies that respect our voice and support Kaktovik's long term success," Kaktovik Iñupiat Corp. President Charles "CC" Lampe said in a statement.</p> <p>A second lease sale in the refuge, held near the end of President Joe Biden's term, yielded no bidders but critics of the sale argued it was too restrictive in scope.</p> <p>Meda DeWitt, Alaska senior manager with The Wilderness Society, said that with Thursday's announcement the administration "is placing corporate interests above the lives, cultures and spiritual responsibilities of the people whose survival depends on the Porcupine caribou herd, the freedom to live from this land and the health of the Arctic Refuge."</p>
<p>The actions detailed Thursday are consistent with those laid out by Trump on his return to office in January, which also included calls to speed the building of a road to connect the communities of King Cove and Cold Bay.</p>
<p>Burgum on Thursday announced completion of a land exchange deal aimed at building the road that would run through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. King Cove residents have long sought a land connection through the refuge to the all-weather airport at Cold Bay, seeing it as vital to accessing emergency medical care. Dunleavy and the congressional delegation have supported the effort, calling it a life and safety issue.</p> <p>Conservationists vowed a legal challenge to the agreement, with some tribal leaders worried a road will drive away migratory birds they rely on. The refuge, near the tip of the Alaska Peninsula, contains internationally recognized habitat for migrating waterfowl. Past land exchange proposals have been met with controversy and litigation.</p> <p>The Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said the latest land agreement would exchange about 500 acres (202 hectares) of "ecologically irreplaceable wilderness lands" within the refuge for up to 1,739 acres (703.7 hectares) of King Cove Corp. lands outside the refuge. Tribal leaders in some communities further north, in Yup'ik communities in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region, have expressed concerns that development of a road would harm the migratory birds important to their subsistence ways of life.</p> <p>"Along with the Native villages of Hooper Bay and Paimiut, we absolutely plan to challenge this decision in court," said Cooper Freeman, the center's Alaska director.</p> <p>U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, told reporters she has been fighting for the land access for King Cove throughout her tenure and has been to both the community and the refuge. She called the refuge a "literal bread basket" for many waterfowl and said it was in everyone's interest to ensure that a road is built with minimal disturbance.</p>
<p>"I think it's important to remember that nobody's talking about a multi-lane paved road moving lots of big trucks back and forth," she said. "It is still an 11-mile, one-lane, gravel, noncommercial-use road."<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">'Uncharted territory': Ongoing shutdown threatens food aid for 42 million people</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>In just over a week, nearly 42 million people in the U.S. who get federal<strong> </strong>food assistance are in danger of seeing their benefits disappear because of the ongoing federal shutdown.</p> <p>About 1 in 8 U.S. residents get an average of $187 a month through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. One of those people is Shari Jablonowski. The 66-year-old widow, who lives outside Pittsburgh, is bracing to lose the $291 in food aid her disabled nephew gets each month. She raised her now-adult nephew and two nieces as her own, and even without this looming crisis, her budget is a tightrope.</p>
<p>"This month, I could not afford to pay … anything, gas or electric," she says. Instead she paid her monthly car payment, since she needs to drive to doctors' appointments, visit her mother, and one niece uses the car to get to work.</p>
<p>If her nephew's food benefit disappears in November? "I am very concerned I will not have heat," she says. It would also ruin Thanksgiving.</p> <p>SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is the country's largest anti-hunger program.</p>
<p>"The vast majority are children, working people, older Americans, veterans and people with disabilities," Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America, says of food stamp recipients. "If the SNAP program shuts down, we will have the most mass hunger suffering we've had in America since the Great Depression."</p> <p>For most people, SNAP is the only money they get directly. Cash welfare was dramatically reduced in the 1990s, Berg notes, and Medicaid payments go directly to doctors, hospitals and drug companies."The only thing that really helps moderate income and low-income Americans meet their basic monthly expenses is the SNAP program. And that's why it's so vital, not only in terms of fighting hunger, but just keeping tens of millions of Americans afloat each month," he says.</p>
<p>In addition, a separate nutrition program for 7 million pregnant women and new parents is also at risk of running out of money. The Trump administration tapped $300 million in tariff funds to keep WIC — the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children — afloat, but it's expected to run out within a few weeks. Some states say they'll help fill that funding gap, but not all have the resources for that.</p> <h3 class="edTag">There's pressure on USDA to keep funding SNAP</h3> <p>Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has warned that SNAP funding will run out on Nov. 1, and USDA has told states that payments are on hold "until further notice."</p> <p>The agency blames Democrats, who say they won't vote to end the shutdown unless Republicans agree to extend tax credits for the Affordable Care Act to keep health insurance premiums from skyrocketing.</p>
<p>In a statement to NPR a USDA spokesperson said, "We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for healthcare for illegals or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments."</p> <p>Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>Food aid advocates say USDA can and should keep funding SNAP. "SNAP still has billions of dollars in what are called contingency reserves," says Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-partisan research and policy institute. That wouldn't cover the entire amount, but she says the agency could legally transfer additional funds, as they've done for the WIC nutrition program. In fact, Bergh argues USDA has a legal obligation to fund SNAP since it's an entitlement program.</p> <p>Department officials did not respond to an NPR query about whether there is such a legal obligation.</p> <p>The origins of U.S. food benefits go back to the Great Depression. If funding does lapse next month, Bergh says, "We would be in uncharted territory."</p>
<p>And for some SNAP recipients it could be double whammy. That's because many will be subject to new work requirements tied to the benefit<strong> </strong>starting November 1 – the same day their benefits might end.</p> <p>The work requirements, passed by Congressional Republicans earlier this year, are expected to push 2.4 million people off the program over the next decade.</p> <h3 class="edTag">States and food banks are scrambling to help</h3> <p>In a letter Thursday, the U.S. Conference of Mayors also urged USDA not to let SNAP benefits be disrupted, saying the program helps stabilize local economies.Each month, the federal government pays $8 billion in SNAP benefits. The money is automatically added to a debit-like card that recipients can then use at groceries, farmers markets and other places. More than 250,000 food retailers count on that income, says Berg with Hunger Free America.</p> <p>It's not clear whether the government will act in time to prevent SNAP benefits from ending. And if it does – but waits until the last minute – it would take days to get the benefits distributed to states and then onto people's spending cards.</p> <p>Meanwhile, states are preparing for a spike in demand at food banks. Virginia, for example, declared a state of emergency and said it would provide food benefits. Colorado's governor urged people to donate to food banks, and California said it would send National Guard troops to help out at food banks, as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> <p>But advocates say even expanded food charity will nowhere near make up for the loss of billions in federal funding.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Shari Jablonowski struggles to think how she'll cope with a major hole in her budget. She already visits food pantries and plans to step that up. But "there's nothing I can do to make money," she says. "I'm not in the greatest of health."</p>
<p>For now, she's making big batches of soup and freezing some for later.</p>

<div class="article-title">A frog, a lobster and a unicorn walked into a No Kings protest</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. — Even before the No Kings rallies kicked off last weekend, some Republicans cast the protests in a sinister light. House Speaker Mike Johnson called them "Hate America" rallies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that they would attract "the most unhinged in the Democratic party."</p> <p>Instead, the rallies were most notable for a funhouse Noah's Ark of frogs, pandas, koalas, woodchucks, sharks and lobsters. Taking a page from the protest playbook in Portland, people showed up in inflatable animal costumes.</p> <p>In Washington, a poodle and a chicken danced to drum music with three dinosaurs next to the National Gallery, a short walk from the U.S. Capitol. Scott Rohrbach, a senior optical engineer at NASA, came dressed as a unicorn. It was not his first choice.</p>
<p>"I would have come as a frog, but I couldn't find a frog," said Rohrbach, disappointed that all the frog costumes were sold out.</p> <p>Rohrbach said he came to protest because he fears that under President Trump, future elections may not be fair. He wore the costume to counter the Republican narrative that protesters like him are hate-filled, anti-American radicals.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Inspiration from a frog suit</h3> <p>"One of the things fascists can't handle is humor," said Rohrbach, who added that fellow protesters posed with him for selfies and kids gave him high-fives.</p> <p>President Trump has said repeatedly that he is neither a fascist nor a king and dismissed the rallies.</p> <p>"I think it's a joke," he told reporters. "I looked at the people. They're not representative of this country."</p> <p>The president answered the demonstrations with his own brand of humor, posting an AI-generated video of him wearing a crown while flying a jet and dumping what looked like excrement on protesters.</p> <p>So what inspired Rohrbach and so many others to dress up like animals and mythical creatures last weekend?</p> <p>It all started earlier this month in Portland. A man in a frog suit was trying to help a fellow protester at an anti-ICE rally. A law enforcement officer responded by spraying the suit's air valve with a chemical agent as captured on video.</p>
<p>The image of the officer in a black helmet and shield going after the protester in the frog costume caught the eye of many, including Jordy Lybeck, a political streamer. Lybeck began brainstorming in real time with his viewers.</p> <p>"How much are those outfits?" Lybeck wondered aloud. "Are you thinking what I'm thinking? What if somebody bought a lot of them and distributed them at the facility?"</p> <p>That's exactly what Lybeck and Brooks Brown, who streams about philosophy, did. They raised money online, bought more costumes and drove them to the ICE facility in Portland.</p>
<p>They call it "Operation Inflation." The goal: Undermine Trump's argument that he had to deploy troops because Portland was, as he put it, a "war zone."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Absurdist humor as an effective tactic</h3> <p>"People who were watching at home saw that we were mocking the lies about how Portland is a wasteland of burning nightmares," Brown told NPR.</p> <p>He also said the costumes make protesters seem less threatening — it's hard to see out of or move quickly in an inflatable suit. Brown said he spoke to a police officer on the scene who thought the same.</p> <p>"He said he knows anyone in these costumes isn't going to be doing something that they've got to run from," said Brown, "which is fair, because if you haven't been in one of these costumes, you cannot run in them."</p>
<p>Kim Lane Scheppele is a Princeton professor who studies democracy and authoritarianism. She says absurdist humor can be an effective tactic against autocrats, which is how she views Trump. Scheppele recalled a case in the Siberian city of Barnaul in 2012.</p> <p>Critics of Vladimir Putin, who was running for a third term as Russian president, put dozens of children's toys in the main square. The toys, which included teddy bears and Transformers, held signs criticizing corruption and calling for fair elections.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Toys in Siberia </h3> <p>City officials in Barnaul determined the demonstration was unsanctioned. When demonstrators petitioned to hold a second protest, officials rejected it on the grounds that the toys were "inanimate objects" and not "citizens of Russia," according to Britain's Guardian newspaper and the U.S. government's Radio Free Europe.</p> <p>Scheppele says stunts like this publicize a political message while laying a trap for officials.</p> <p>"They do it in such a way that any response from the government makes them look worse," she told NPR.</p> <p>Brown, the streamer, says dressing up as animals serves a similar purpose here. He says the funny-looking outfits change the optics of protests so that government force looks more like farce. After all, it's not easy to portray an inflatable frog — or unicorn — as "the enemy from within."</p>

<div class="article-title">Chess body investigating ex-world champion who accused Daniel Naroditsky of cheating</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The International Chess Federation is investigating a Russian grandmaster for allegations of cheating he levied at fellow elite players, including 29-year-old U.S. grandmaster and YouTube sensation Daniel Naroditsky, who died earlier this week.</p> <p>The world governing body for chess, known as FIDE, said Wednesday that it was looking into statements Vladimir Kramnik made "both before and after the tragic death of GM Daniel Naroditsky" to determine if the Russian chess legend should suffer disciplinary actions.</p> <p>"In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people's reputation but their very well-being," FIDE President Arkady Dvorkovich said in a statement on the organization's website.</p>
<p>"When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks — a particularly serious concern in today's environment," Dvorkovich added.</p> <p>FIDE did not immediately respond to a request for comment detailing the steps of the investigation and what possible disciplinary action might be taken.</p>
<p>The news of Naroditsky's death rocked the chess community and left many of his fans and supporters looking for answers.</p> <p>The Charlotte Chess Center in North Carolina, where Naroditsky worked as a coach, did not immediately disclose a cause of death.</p> <p>Naroditsky was remembered by his peers as a player of immense skill who remained humble despite his talents.</p> <p>In addition to training other players, Naroditsky ran successful YouTube and Twitch accounts where he grew a fandom of fellow chess lovers and introduced the game to a new generation of players.</p>
<p>In what appeared to be his final stream on Twitch last week, Naroditsky appeared at times agitated and irritable as he described the stress that the Kramnik accusations had caused him. He explained why he felt the need to counter the Russian player's public dispersions.</p> <p>"And you know, then there's of course people who will be like, 'OK, sure, whatever, but how does that impact your livelihood? … Even if some GM [grandmaster] will think this like who cares?,' " Naroditsky said on the stream.</p>
<p>"That is shocking to me as well because that literally is what a legacy is. That is all I have," he said.</p> <p>"If I knew that some of the most influential movers and shakers of the chess world, you know, would carry the notion that I am a completely morally bankrupt individual, that would represent the complete failure of literally everything … my reason for waking up in the morning," Naroditsky said.</p> <p>On social media, Kramnik, a former world champion who is considered one of the all-time greats, described what he called the FIDE's "insulting and unfair" "campaign" against him.</p> <p>Naroditsky is not the first player to get ensnared in conflict with the Russian chess giant. The 50-year-old Kramnik has baselessly accused several of his younger competitors of cheating, resulting in his account on the popular site chess.com being muted in 2023.</p>
<p>In a series of ranting posts on social media on Wednesday, Kramnik doubled down on his accusations, writing: "From prominent players, you all know their names, but will not [disclose] it in public … #chessmafia must be held accountable."</p> <p>Kramnik wrote that Naroditsky supporters had been "falsely blaming" him for the chess streamer's death and threatened legal action against people involved in making those claims.</p> <p>Without citing any evidence, Kramnik alleged there were efforts to conceal the "real truth about the [circumstances] and cause of this [tragedy]."</p> <p>To honor Naroditsky's memory, FIDE announced this week it would establish a special prize in his name.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">'A slap in the face': Ranchers feel betrayed by Trump's plan to buy Argentine beef</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>This year, Destinee Weeks and her husband, who manage a herd of about 250 cattle in northern Oklahoma, began to see a profit for the first time in a decade. So Weeks was shocked and dismayed when she learned President Trump was looking to import more beef from another country.</p> <p>" It feels like a slap in the face to rural America," she said. "It makes you feel invisible and overlooked."</p> <p>Beef prices have been soaring in the U.S. as a result of a shrunken cattle supply. On Sunday, Trump suggested buying beef from Argentina could be one way to lower costs. It comes as the president already agreed to a $20 billion currency swap to boost the South American ally's struggling economy.</p>
<p>American cattle ranchers and agricultural groups swiftly opposed the possible deal, arguing that it would hurt ranchers. But Trump defended the move while talking to reporters on Sunday, asserting that "Argentina is fighting for its life." He also claimed on Truth Social that his global tariffs have helped ranchers.</p> <p>"The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don't understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States," Trump wrote in his Wednesday post.</p> <p>Despite days of verbal clashes between president and ranchers, the White House on Wednesday confirmed plans to quadruple the tariff-rate quota for beef imports from Argentina. The same day, the Department of Agriculture announced an action plan to support domestic cattle ranchers.</p> <p>The United States Cattlemen's Association said the USDA's initiative was a positive step forward, but the group was still "deeply concerned" about the move to purchase more foreign beef.</p> <p>"A deal of this magnitude with Argentina would undercut the very foundation of our cattle industry," USCA president Justin Tupper said in a statement.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Cattle ranchers say it's not their fault that prices are high</strong></h3> <p>The U.S. cattle inventory is at its lowest levels in decades — a trend driven by drought and rising operation costs, which has forced many ranchers to shrink their herds.</p>
<p>In August, the cost of ground beef per pound was about $6.63 — about two dollars more than it was four years ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At the same time, higher prices have offered a path to recovery for some ranchers like Weeks.</p> <p>"I wanna make it very clear, when we say it's profitable, no one's riding off into the sunset in a yacht," she said. "We're healing up."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some ranchers argue there's another key player shaping beef prices: the four meatpacking firms that control over 80% of U.S. beef processing.</p> <p>" The American rancher is not in control of the price of beef in this country," said Christian Lovell, an Illinois cattle producer and senior director of programs at Farm Action, a nonpartisan advocacy group.</p> <p>Recently, two of those companies — Tyson Foods and Cargill — agreed to pay a combined $87.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit accusing them of fixing beef prices. It's a big reason why Lovell called the cattle market "broken."</p> <p>"Importing more beef is not going to fix that problem," he said.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Some are skeptical that importing Argentine beef will lower prices</strong></h3> <p>The U.S. already imports a record amount of beef from other countries, including Argentina, according to David Anderson, a livestock economist at Texas A&amp;M University.</p> <p>The challenge with relying on foreign meat to bring down prices is that the U.S. is the world's largest consumer of beef. Anderson said it's unlikely that Argentina has nearly enough supply to satisfy America's appetite.</p> <p>"They just don't have the kind of supplies that they could export to us that would make much of a noticeable impact on U.S. beef prices to consumers," he said.</p> <p>Anderson added that ultimately, it will take time for beef prices to stabilize.</p> <p>"There's no easy solution to bringing down prices — particularly an easy, quick solution," he said.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>The moves comes after a fallout with other farmers </strong></h3> <p>John Boyd Jr., a cattle and crop farmer in Virginia and the founder of the National Black Farmers Association, has already been reeling from Trump's trade war with China, which has caused it to stop buying U.S. soybeans. Now, Boyd is concerned about his cattle business.</p> <p>"Everything that the president is messing with and interfering with affects my farming operation," he said.</p> <p>The USDA on Wednesday responded to the ranchers' concerns by laying out a slew of plans to strengthen the country's beef industry. That includes expanding grazing access and bolstering natural disaster relief.</p>
<p>Still, Boyd said purchasing more meat from Argentina does not sit right with him.</p> <p>"I'm opposed to Argentina getting anything else from the United States," he said.</p> <p>These clashes are particularly notable because farmers and ranchers are a major voting bloc for Trump. Weeks, from Oklahoma, said she simply wants the president to stick to his agenda of putting America first.</p> <p>"I think that we should always choose to support our domestic producers," she said.</p>

<div class="article-title">'Why does my toddler … ?' Your kiddo's most confounding behavior, decoded</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Parenting a two year old is such a wild ride. The other day, my son started the morning with an explosion of cuddles, followed immediately by refusing the blueberry muffins he had declared his <em>very favorite</em> the week before. Once we made it through breakfast, the daily Battle of Putting on Shoes was still ahead!</p>
<p>Sometimes, I feel like I'm playing a game of emotional ping pong with my kid. And that can be hard for both me and him to manage.</p> <p>Fast-changing feelings and defiant behavior are developmentally appropriate for one to three year olds, says pediatric psychologist Roger Harrison. They're a way of building your kid's sense of self — and understanding their place in the world.</p> <p>But for parents, they can often be a source of frustration, he says. When tantrums and power struggles arise from those emotions, it can be easy for us adults to lose our patience. </p>
<p>Reframing your toddler's boundary-pushing as a means of social and emotional learning might offer some relief, says Harrison, a division chief within the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p> <p>"When we understand the 'why' of certain behaviors and place them within an appropriate developmental context, it allows parents to step back from the emotion and address the behavior strategically," he says.</p> <p>Harrison and other child development experts answer questions about common toddler behaviors — and offer advice on how to respond in the situation.</p> <h2 class="edTag">Why does my toddler … say "NO!" to<strong> </strong>everything, even to things they like? </h2> <p>A toddler's contrarian nature is just par for the course at this stage of development, says Harrison. In addition to developing more language and cognitive and motor skills at lightning speed, they're just beginning to understand that they are their own unique person separate from their caregivers. With this new awareness comes a need to test boundaries in order to establish independence.</p> <p>"Part of that process of  figuring out who I am is to learn <em>me</em> in opposition to all the things in the world," he says.</p>
<p>So if your toddler gives you a resounding "NO!" to his favorite popsicle or book before bedtime, what he might be actually doing is trying to flex his newly discovered self-awareness. His "no" could translate to, "Check this out, Mommy! I'm a person with my own mind and opinions now!"</p> <p>⭐ <strong>Parent tip:<em> </em></strong>What should you do if you need your child to say "yes" to, say, brushing their teeth, getting in their car seat or leaving the playground?</p> <p>Model a calm response, then kindly but firmly let them know what's going to happen next, says Jamie Glowacki, a parenting and potty training coach and the<strong> </strong>author of <em>Oh Crap! I Have a Toddler</em>. You might say: <em>Yes, we do need to leave the playground. You can either go down the slide one more time and walk out with me, or I can carry you out right now.</em> </p>
<h2 class="edTag">Why does my toddler … say everything is "mine"?</h2>
<p>In Toddlerland, "the rules of ownership are different," Harrison says. "If it's mine, it's <em>mine</em>. If it's yours and <em>I</em> want it, it's also mine."</p> <p>As a child starts to build their identity and independence, they'll often try to exert control over their environment through possession, Harrison says. It helps them understand themselves and their attachments in the world.</p> <p>For example: my mom has black hair, so I have black hair. My sister has a cool toy, so I have a cool toy. <em>I am a kid with black hair and a cool toy! Mine, mine, mine!</em>  By making claims like these, a toddler can test the boundaries of their environment to better define who they are.</p>
<p>So if your toddler claims every book in the library is hers or refuses to share even her <em>least </em>favorite stuffie on her playdate — don't stress, says Harrison. She's not being selfish, she's just stretching out that newfound sense of self. </p> <p>⭐ <strong>Parent tip:</strong> If you want your kid to share, model then practice the behavior, says early childhood educator Chazz Lewis. For example, in the aftermath of a toy dispute with another child on the playground, teach your toddler to ask for a turn by reaching your palm out assertively and saying, "turn, please," he says. Do a few practice rounds before sending them back out to play. </p> <h2 class="edTag">Why does my toddler … want to lick/smash/crash into everything?</h2>
<p>Does your little one love to spill every container they can get their hands on, lick colorful wallpaper or bounce against your living room like it's a life-size pinball machine?</p> <p>They may simply be trying to gain some sensory information about their surroundings, says Layne Deyling Cherland, a longtime preschool teacher-turned-content creator who focuses on adult-toddler dynamics.</p>
<p>To them, every action and interaction is a chance to gather more data about themselves and how things work. "What's me and what's not me? What effect do I have on the world? That's what all this experimenting is," says Deyling Cherland.</p> <p>They may also be craving proprioceptive input, like the deep pressure gained from tight hugs or the strength-building from climbing on playground equipment, she says. </p> <p>Toddlers crave these types of sensory experiences in part because it builds up their internal sense of position and movement, which is important for coordination, balance and even self-regulation.</p> <p>⭐ <strong>Parent tip<em>:</em></strong><em> </em>As long as she's safe, let your little one explore, says Deyling Cherland. Embracing weirdness or silliness can be an opportunity for connection and a key to disrupting power struggles. </p> <p>Make an obstacle course with pillows and stuffies to get those zoomies out, then race through it together. Dole out some new or favorite snacks into separate bowls and have your picky eater play a game of blind taste-testing.</p> <h2 class="edTag">Why does my toddler … keep doing that thing I told them not to do 100 times?</h2>
<p><em>No running in the kitchen! I said, don't run in the kitchen! You have 10 seconds to stop running in the kitchen or you're in big trouble, missy! </em></p> <p>If you're repeating yourself a bunch with your toddler, you've likely already lost control of the situation, says Glowacki.</p> <p>From a comprehension standpoint, your average toddler doesn't yet grasp the concept of negation, Lewis says. So when you say <em>don't </em>run in the kitchen, what your child is more likely to understand from that sentence is: <em>run </em>in the kitchen.</p> <p>More importantly, simply telling a kid what you <em>don't </em>want them to do doesn't give them any tools for how to behave successfully in the future, he says.</p> <p>⭐ <strong>Parent tip: </strong>Instead of telling your toddler what they're doing <em>wrong</em>, teach them how to solve the problem or what they should do instead, says Lewis. If you want your kid to stop running in the kitchen, you might say, "walk slowly in the kitchen." Or maybe, "please walk slowly and gently on the tile floor so you don't hurt yourself."</p>
<p>"Now, there's a chance they might actually do something different this time," Lewis says.</p> <h2 class="edTag">Why does my toddler … hate switching activities?</h2>
<p><em>Wake up! Change clothes! Eat breakfast!  </em>Toddlers are bossed around all day long, often with little understanding and even less say in their daily schedule.</p> <p>While toddlers thrive on routine and consistency, transitioning from one task to another can be frustrating, Glowacki says. The break in continuity can be unsettling, especially when they're immersed in an activity that gives them a sense of comfort and independence, like playtime or bath time. Those moments are also one of the very few pieces of the world she can exert any agency over, so that loss of control can feel acute.</p> <p>Add to that hunger, sleepiness, overstimulation — daily factors that would stress out any other human — and those transition periods can become triggers for volatile emotions and tantrums, she says.</p> <p>⭐ <strong>Parent tip: <em> </em></strong>The next time your little one throws a fit about transitioning from playtime to dinnertime, try to remember that the change is huge for her, says Glowacki.</p> <p>Put a little power back into her hands by offering two positive choices, Lewis says. For example: Blue plate or purple plate? Juice or milk? This gives her agency but allows you to safely steer her where she needs to go. </p> <p>"The goal of toddlerhood is to give a child manageable pieces of personal power to practice with," Deyling Cherland says. "We want them to have practiced enough so that when they are this young adult going out into the world, they know, 'This is how I make decisions. My decisions do affect other people.'

<div class="article-title">Effort to pay at least some federal workers fails in Senate</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The Senate has failed to advance a pair of competing measures to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown, a day before more than a million workers are set to miss a paycheck.</p> <p>One of the failed bills was a Republican-backed measure to allow employees who are deemed essential to receive a paycheck during a shutdown. Those workers, including troops, TSA agents and federal law enforcement like the Capitol Police, are currently working without pay.</p> <p>An alternate version introduced by Democrats called for paying all federal employees – and blocking more mass layoffs by the Trump administration's Office of Management and Budget during the shutdown.</p>
<p>"We certainly shouldn't set up a system where the president of the United States gets to decide what agencies to shut down, who to pay and who not to pay, who to punish, who not to punish," said the sponsor of that bill, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the White House fired several thousand federal employees, a move the courts later put on hold.</p> <p>"I don't think we should limit the president's ability, the chief executive's ability, to properly manage the federal government, and make the tough decisions sometimes to reduce the workforce," said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., who introduced the GOP funding measure.</p> <p>The Republican-backed measure did not receive the 60 votes needed to pass. Republicans blocked the Democrats' version from a vote.</p> <p>The names themselves of the rival proposals highlight the growing tensions between Democrats and Republicans as the shutdown stretches on. Republicans named their measure, "The Shutdown Fairness Act." Democrats titled theirs the, "True Shutdown Fairness Act."</p> <p>During a Thursday press conference, House Republicans called attention to air traffic controllers who are working without pay.</p> <p>"We are all about safety," Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said. "But I can't guarantee you that your flight's going to be on time. I can't guarantee you that your flight's not going to be cancelled."</p>
<p>The federal government has now been closed for 23 days, the second-longest in U.S. history and the longest full shutdown.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans want to advance a House-passed bill that would temporarily fund the government at current levels, while Democrats are holding out for a deal to extend health insurance subsidies expiring soon.</p> <p>Many Republican lawmakers think Thanksgiving travel headaches will be a tipping point for Democrats. Democrats are also under pressure as states are beginning to announce that funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, will run out soon.</p> <p>Democrats have also said that premium spikes during the open enrollment period beginning Nov. 1 for health plans purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace will push Republicans to budge.</p> <p>The Senate has now voted 12 times on the Republican-backed funding bill. The House has not held votes for several weeks, and senators are preparing to leave town for the weekend.</p> <p>Top congressional leaders, Republican and Democrat, say they are no closer to agreeing to a path to reopen the government.</p>

<div class="article-title">How presidents have changed the White House — and how Trump's ballroom is different</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Crews are demolishing the East Wing of the White House to make way for the construction of President Trump's $300 million, 90,000 square-foot ballroom, despite outcry from historical preservation groups and a lack of federal approval.</p> <p>The Trump administration dismissed widespread criticism as "manufactured outrage" in a fact sheet released Tuesday, which outlines the various renovations that presidents have made to the property over the last century and suggests this one is no different.</p>
<p>"Unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies are clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House — a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and additions from commanders-in-chief to keep the executive residence as a beacon of American excellence," the White House said.</p> <p>The White House has undergone renovations both large and small since its creation in 1792. But this would be the biggest addition — in scope and size — since the 1940s, Priya Jain, the chair of the Society of Architectural Historians' Heritage Conservation Committee, told NPR.</p>
<p>"In the list that was issued yesterday, if you look at it closely, all the changes after 1942 have been limited to the interior," Jain said. "And the ones on the exterior either involved simple restoration or minor site additions like the tennis court and the pavilion, which are limited by their scope, size and visibility to have any negative impact on the historic building."</p> <p>Here's a look at how presidents have changed the White House.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">1700s and 1800s: The White House is built and rebuilt</h3> <p>The cornerstone for the White House was laid in the newly designated nation's capital in October 1792, a year after President George Washington selected the site himself.</p> <p>The neoclassical building was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban and constructed by a team of enslaved and freed Black Americans and European immigrants over the course of eight years.</p>
<p>President John Adams and his wife, Abigail, were the first to inhabit the residence, which was still unfinished by the time they moved in toward the end of his term in November 1800. President Thomas Jefferson moved in the following year and went on to decorate the "president's house" with furnishings he had inherited from all of his presidential predecessors.</p> <p>But almost all of it was lost in 1814, when British troops set fire to the building during the War of 1812. President James Madison and first lady Dolley Madison both fled Washington, D.C., to safety, the latter managing to bring a full-size portrait of former President George Washington with her. Both returned to a temporary residence to finish out his presidency.</p>
<p>Hoban oversaw the rebuilding of the White House. Its second incarnation, which closely resembled the first, officially reopened with President James Monroe's arrival in 1817.</p>
<p>Monroe later tasked Hoban with the building's first major addition, the South Portico — the iconic rounded entrance lined with Ionic columns — was completed in 1824. Construction of the North Portico was completed in 1830, under President Andrew Jackson.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Early 20th century: The creation and expansion of the West Wing</h3> <p>The next big changes happened under President Theodore Roosevelt.</p> <p>In 1901, he renamed it the "White House" in all formal communications, making its longtime nickname official. (It was originally called the "president's house" or "executive mansion", but most people started referring to it by its limestone white-wash coloring in the early 1800s.)</p> <p>In 1902, Roosevelt began a major renovation of the physical building that "transformed it from a crazy quilt of alterations over time into a cohesive statement of modern times," the late author and historian William Seale wrote.</p>
<p>The biggest change was the relocation of his office from the second floor to the West Wing, originally called the Executive Office Building. The separate, one-story structure was accessible by walkway and housed the offices of presidential staff and secretaries as well as a Cabinet meeting room.</p> <p>The project expanded the first family's living quarters (necessary, since the Roosevelts had six young kids) and modernized the building's heating and plumbing systems. It also created the East Terrace — a new entryway for guests that would later become the East Wing.</p>
<p>Subsequent presidents continued to build on Roosevelt's renovations.</p> <p>President William Taft remodeled and expanded the West Wing in 1909 to create the Oval Office. President Calvin Coolidge had the roof rebuilt and a third floor added in 1927, after an engineering report showed that the roof trusses were weakened and unsafe.</p> <p>The West Wing was remodeled after a 1929 fire and further expanded in 1934, when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt relocated the Oval Office to its current location for more privacy, built more offices underground and installed an indoor swimming pool for his polio therapy (financed by private donations).</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Mid-20th century: Controversial additions and a major renovation</h3> <p>FDR also had the East Wing created in 1942, primarily to cover up an underground bunker and to house more staff and offices during the war.</p>
<p>According to the White House Historical Association, the wartime construction of the East Wing was highly controversial. Republicans criticized it as wasteful and accused Roosevelt of "using the project to bolster his presidency's image."</p>
<p>"The secretive nature of the construction, tied to military purposes, further fueled suspicions," wrote association president Stewart McLaurin. "However, the East Wing's utility in supporting the modern presidency eventually quieted critics."</p> <p>The next major renovation, and perhaps the biggest one, happened under President Harry Truman in the late 1940s.</p> <p>In response to structural deficiencies, his architects decided to gut the entire interior, leaving only the exterior walls intact, between 1948 and 1952. The project cost the equivalent of $60 million — funded and authorized by Congress — and drew intense scrutiny from preservationists and the public.</p>
<p>One of the most controversial changes was the addition of a balcony to the second floor of the South Portico. While opposed by some architectural purists and Truman's opponents in Congress for both aesthetic and financial reasons, the Truman Balcony has become a hallmark of both first family leisure and official White House events (think: Easter Egg roll).</p> <p>"The Truman Balcony was something that was really controversial at the time, and now it's one of the most beloved parts of the White House for the president and their family to be sitting outside looking out on the South Lawn," Kate Andersen Brower, author of <em>The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House</em>, told NPR's <em>Here &amp; Now.</em></p> <p>Truman funded the balcony himself, using money from his allocated household account. Brower said Trump's ballroom is the biggest renovation since then — but is different in key ways.</p> <p>"[Truman] wasn't going to take no for an answer, but he did go through the channels to get approval for this renovation. And we're not seeing President Trump do the same thing," she added.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Late 20th century onward: Presidents personalize the grounds </h3> <p>Recent decades have seen frequent but relatively minor changes to White House grounds.</p> <p>President John F. Kennedy created the modern Rose Garden in 1963 — and it remained relatively unchanged until this August, when Trump had it paved over and turned into a patio.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon converted the indoor swimming pool into the White House Press Room and installed a one-lane bowling alley, while President Gerald Ford had a swimming pool (also privately funded) built outdoors.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, President George W. Bush modernized the press briefing room and the Situation Room and installed the first-ever solar electric system on White House grounds (President Jimmy Carter first installed solar heating panels on the White House roof in 1979, but they were removed in the 1980s).</p> <p>President Barack Obama adapted a tennis court so it could also be used for basketball, and First Lady Michelle Obama planted the White House Kitchen Garden on the South Lawn.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Trump has changed the grounds already</h3>
<p>Trump himself has made a slew of renovations since his second term began in January, and not just to the Rose Garden.</p> <p>He's also bedecked the Oval Office with gilded frames and golden details, and added a Presidential Walk of Fame to the walkway between the West Wing and executive residence. It features portraits of every previous president except for President Joe Biden. Instead of a headshot, Biden's frame features a picture of an autopen, which Trump has repeatedly accused him of using (despite the fact that the practice is not prohibited).</p>
<p>The White House says Trump is carrying on a "proud presidential legacy" of making upgrades to the building, in this case increasing its capacity to host major functions. The East Room currently seats about 200 people for dinner, meaning many large White House events are hosted outside in fancy tents with floors and chandeliers.</p> <p>Brower, the author, says there is a case to be made for expanding the entertaining space at the White House, with caveats: "I don't think that it has to be of this size and scope, two football fields big and larger than the White House itself."</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump plows ahead with East Wing demolition despite calls for caution</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>All that's left of the East Wing of the White House is a pile of rubble.</p> <p>A White House official not authorized to speak on the record tells NPR the demolition phase of President Trump's project to build a 90,000 square foot ballroom, is ahead of schedule.</p> <p>Although Trump initially said the project wouldn't "interfere with the current building" and would be "near it but not touching it," he explained Wednesday that "in order to do it properly, we had to take down the existing structure."</p> <p>The East Wing demolition, the White House official said, is going directly up to the edge of the residence and includes tearing down the East Garden Room, Family Theater and East Colonnade, as well as the complex of offices. The sight of excavators tearing into the East Wing set off alarms among preservationists, but the White House is doubling down, insisting the demolition is necessary.</p>
<p>"The plans changed, and the president heard counsel from the architects and the construction companies who said that in order for this East Wing to be modern and beautiful for many, many years to come, for it to be a truly strong and stable structure, this Phase 1 that we're now in was necessary," said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, in a briefing on Thursday. "The president wants to do right by the People's House."</p>
<p>The offices and other facilities that were in the East Wing will be rebuilt and modernized, said Leavitt. There will also be security enhancements involving the underground bunker built under the East Wing during World War II, known as the Presidential Emergency Operations Center.</p> <p>The East Wing will "be more beautiful and modern than ever before," said Leavitt. "And in addition, there will be a big, beautiful ballroom that can hold big parties and state visits for generations to come."</p> <p>Going back at least to the year 2010, Trump has complained that the White House doesn't have an appropriate space for State Dinners and other large gatherings, often requiring large tents to be set up on the South Lawn.</p> <p>When it was first announced over the summer, the White House said the project would cost $200 million. Costs have already ballooned, with the president now describing it as a $300 million project, which the White House says will all still be funded by private donors.</p>
<p>In a letter earlier this week, The National Trust for Historic Preservation called on the Trump administration to pause demolition until the ballroom plans go through "the legally required public review processes," which includes input and approval from the National Capital Planning Commission.</p> <p>"We are deeply concerned that the massing and height of the proposed new construction will overwhelm the White House itself — it is 55,000 square feet — and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings," the letter said.</p> <p>In a social media post by Steven Cheung, White House director of communications, said The National Trust for Historic Preservation is "run by a bunch of loser Democrats and liberal donors who are playing political games."</p> <p>A fact sheet released by the White House slammed criticisms as "manufactured outrage" by "unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies" who are "clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House."</p> <p>In a statement to NPR, the White House Historical Association said it created a historic record of the East Wing prior to the demolition through digital scans and photographs.</p> <p>"The East Wing and gardens have been captured in detail for the benefit of our nation and historic artifacts from the East Wing have been preserved and stored," the statement read.</p> <p>But the White House has not yet submitted construction plans to the National Capital Planning Commission, the agency tasked with approving major renovations and construction projects on federal grounds in Washington, D.C. The White House official said they do not have a timeline for submitting the plans, but do intend to seek approval before the construction phase begins.</p> <p>Will Scharff, a top Trump aide and chair of the commission, said during a public commission meeting in September that the commission doesn't have jurisdiction over demolition, therefore it did not need to approve Trump's plan to tear down the East Wing to make way for the ballroom.</p>
<p>"Any assertion that this commission should have been consulted earlier than it has been or that it will be is simply false and represents a misunderstanding of this commission's role in that project," Scharff said. "When we are submitted a plan, we will review that plan."</p> <p>The commission is currently closed due to the government shutdown and their October meeting has been canceled.</p> <p>Preston Bryant, the former chair of the commission for nine years and appointed by then-President Barack Obama and Trump during his first term, doesn't agree with Scharff's assertion over jurisdiction. In an email to NPR, Bryant said the commission's review and approval process includes the entire project design.</p> <p>"In that process, what's demolished would be part of the project plan to be reviewed and approved. What's demolished is inherent in the design. Site preparation also is inherent in the design," he said.</p> <p>The ballroom has a hefty price tag attached to it. Trump said during a meeting on Wednesday that the project will cost around $300 million. That's up from previous estimates of $200 to $250 million. But Trump claims the ballroom is exclusively paid for by himself and private donors.</p> <p>The White House official said the project has secured $200 million in donations so far and provided a list of donors to NPR. The donors include big names like Amazon, Google, Meta and Lockheed Martin.</p> <p>Here's the full list of donors, provided by the official: </p> <ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"><li>Altria Group Inc.</li><li>Amazon</li><li>Apple</li><li>Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.</li><li>Caterpillar Inc.</li><li>Coinbase</li><li>Comcast Corporation</li><li>J.
