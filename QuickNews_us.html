<div class="article-title">Convicted felon federally charged after threatening Atlanta airport while armed with AR-15 rifle</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Georgia man accused of threatening to "shoot up" Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport has been federally charged after authorities say he arrived at the busy travel hub with an AR-15-style rifle and dozens of rounds of ammunition in his truck.</p><p>Convicted felon Billy Joe Cagle, 49, was charged in a criminal complaint on Tuesday with attempted violence at an international airport, interstate communications containing threats to injure the person of another and being a felon in possession of a firearm.</p><p>"As alleged in this complaint, Cagle senselessly threatened to do heinous violence to innocent travelers, at the world’s busiest airport, with a high-powered weapon that he had no legal right to possess," U.S. Attorney Theodore S. Hertzberg said. "Thanks to the vigilance of other citizens and the quick action of law enforcement, a horrible tragedy was averted."</p><p>Hertzberg said Cagle was on a FaceTime call on Monday when he allegedly threatened to "shoot up the airport." The airport Cagle was referring to was Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.</p><p>While on the call, Hertzberg added, Cagle allegedly stated, "I’m at the airport, and I’m gonna go rat-a-tat-tat," before abruptly ending the call.</p><p>The person on the other end of the call went to the Cartersville Police Department to report Cagle’s threat, and officers with the department alerted the Atlanta Police Department. Cartersville also provided Atlanta police with photos of Cagle and a description of the Chevrolet pickup truck he was reportedly driving.</p><p>Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said at a Monday afternoon news conference that Cagle arrived at the airport’s South Terminal at 9:29 a.m. Officers do not believe he was armed, Schierbaum said, adding that video showed him walking toward a crowded TSA checkpoint.</p><p>Officers canvassed the area and issued a "be-on-the-lookout" alert for Cagle and his Chevrolet flatbed pickup truck.</p><p>Schierbaum said officers, using a photo of Cagle, found him at 9:54 a.m. and took him into custody.</p><p>During a safety sweep of the airport’s outer perimeter, officers found Cagle’s pickup. Inside, they said they discovered an AR-15 loaded with 27 rounds in the back seat. The weapon was cleared, and the scene declared safe.</p><p>The FBI is investigating the case with assistance from both the Cartersville and Atlanta police departments and Clayton County District Attorney's office.</p><p>"This is a perfect example of ‘See Something, Say Something’ in action," FBI Atlanta Special Agent in Charge Paul Brown said. "When Billy Joe Cagle’s family noticed something wasn’t right, they alerted authorities. Their quick thinking  —combined with the swift, heroic response of our law enforcement partners — undoubtedly saved lives."</p><p>Cagle has a criminal history, including a "pretty significant" prior drug-possession arrest in Cartersville, according to Schierbaum.</p><p>The charges against Cagle announced Tuesday are in addition to charges announced previously. Those include terroristic threats, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, criminal attempt to commit aggravated assault and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump celebrates White House demolition as new ballroom rises: ‘Music to my ears’</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump's privately funded $200 million White House ballroom is the latest "bold, necessary addition" to the executive residence, officials said, describing the East Wing construction as a continuation of presidential upgrades dating back more than a century.</p><p>Photos of the East Wing façade being demolished went viral Monday, prompting criticism online and a swift rebuttal from the White House, which wrote that "unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies are clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump’s visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom … a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and additions from commanders-in-chief to keep the executive residence a beacon of American excellence."</p><p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt echoed the president's message Tuesday on "Jesse Watters Primetime," saying, "I believe there’s a lot of fake outrage right now.</p><p>"Nearly every single president who’s lived in this beautiful White House behind me has made modernizations and renovations of their own," Leavitt added. "In fact, presidents for decades — in modern times — have joked about how they wished they had a larger event space here at the White House, something that could hold hundreds more people than the current East Room and State Dining Room. </p><p>"President Obama even complained that, during his tenure, he had to hold a state dinner on the South Lawn and rent a very expensive tent."</p><p>In an article shared Tuesday, the administration listed more than a dozen examples of leaders "renovating, expanding and modernizing" the property to "meet the needs of the present day," from Theodore Roosevelt’s West Wing in 1902 to Barack Obama’s Kitchen Garden in 2009.Trump first confirmed the ballroom project Monday on Truth Social, writing, "I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken … to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom. Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernized … and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete!"</p><p>"For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom … I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway — with zero cost to the American Taxpayer!" he continued, crediting "many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and yours truly" for funding the build. "This Ballroom will be happily used for Generations to come!"</p><p>The White House's Rapid Response 47 account also shared a detailed thread on X Tuesday showing how past presidents "have been renovating, expanding, and modernizing the White House to meet the needs of the current day."</p><p>Trump elaborated Tuesday, calling the federal government "this big for nothing." </p><p>"We’re building a world-class ballroom," he said. "You probably hear the beautiful sound of construction to the back here. That’s music to my ears. People don’t like it. I love it. When I hear that sound, it reminds me of money. In this case, a lack of money, because I’m paying for it."</p><p>Trump also noted that the East Room, currently the largest indoor event space, is little more than "a cocktail area" that holds about 88 people.</p><p>During a Diwali event at the White House Tuesday night, Trump again referenced the project and his decision not to accept a salary, quipping that "they probably owe me a lot of money" for everything he’s put into the building.</p><p>"If I get money from our country, I’ll do something nice with it. Like give it to charity or give it to the White House," he said. "We restore the White House, and we’re doing a great job. The ballroom is under construction. They’ve been trying to get it for 150 years."</p><p>The ballroom project is the latest in Trump's improvements to the property, which include an overhaul of the Rose Garden and the Palm Room.</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Greg Wehner contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Giants release kicker Jude McAtamney after game-changing extra point miss with seconds left</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Two days after the New York Giants’ epic collapse to the Denver Broncos, they’ve released one of the players responsible for the 33-32 loss. </p><p>Kicker Jude McAtamney, who missed multiple extra points in the loss, including one that would’ve put the Giants up three with just seconds left in the fourth quarter, has been released after playing four games for New York. </p><p>McAtamney, a second-year NFL kicker from Northern Ireland, joined the Giants through the league’s International Pathway program. After Graham Gano’s injury in Week 3, McAtamney was elevated to take over kicking duties. </p><p>McAtamney, who played college football at Rutgers, started off well for the Giants, making two short field goals and one extra point in his debut against the Los Angeles Chargers. </p><p>But McAtamney missed an extra point against the Philadelphia Eagles last week at home, and it got worse in Denver when he missed one extra point in the first half and the dreaded miss after Jaxson Dart’s rushing score gave New York a 32-30 lead with 37 seconds left in the game. </p><p>The miss proved catastrophic for the Giants, though it wasn’t McAtamney’s fault the Broncos advanced downfield well into Wil Lutz’s field goal range for the win. He knocked a 39-yard field goal on the last play of the game. </p><p>Instead of the field goal tying the game at 33, the Broncos celebrated their come-from-behind victory, while the Giants were in complete shock at what transpired in the fourth quarter. </p><p>McAtamney’s lack of field goal range also played a part in this game because the Giants passed up attempts. They also decided to go for two when they went up 19-0 on Tyrone Tracy Jr.’s rushing score. The conversion was unsuccessful. </p><p>Gano is eligible to come off the injured reserve and was expected to kick on Tuesday to determine if he is ready to return to the team. </p><p>Meanwhile, Younghoe Koo, the former Atlanta Falcons kicker who was released earlier this season, has been on the Giants’ practice squad. He will battle with Gano this week to determine who will be kicking for New York against the Eagles on the road Sunday. </p><p>Gano has battled injuries since the 2023 campaign, and he’s struggled to be available for New York. He has missed 20 games since that season. </p><p>When healthy, Gano has proven to be one of the best kickers in the NFL, making 83.9% of his career field goal attempts.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Aaron Glenn returned to the New York Jets, the franchise where he began his playing career, for his first NFL head coaching opportunity.</p><p>Jets owner Woody Johnson continues to back the first-year coach despite the team’s 0-7 start. However, Johnson's faith does not appear to extend to quarterback Justin Fields.</p><p>"It looks like [Glenn] is turning around part of it," Johnson said Tuesday at the NFL's fall owners meeting.</p><p>Glenn benched Fields in favor of veteran signal-caller Tyrod Taylor at halftime of the Jets’ Week 7 loss to the Carolina Panthers. It remains unclear whether Fields or Taylor will be under center for the Jets' first offensive series in the team's Week 8 matchup with the Cincinnati Bengals.</p><p>Johnson then expressed disappointment over a particular statistical rating attached to Fields.</p><p>"It’s hard when you have a quarterback with the rating that we’ve got," he said. "He has the ability, but something is not jiving. If you look at any head coach with a quarterback like that, you are going to see similar results across the league. You have to play consistently at that position and that’s what we’re going to try to do for the remainder of the season."</p><p>Fields has started six games with the Jets, missing Week 3 due to being in the concussion protocol. He has compiled a 91.1 passer rating this season. While Johnson did hint at optimism, he quickly acknowledged "you can't win with hope, but it helps."</p><p>Johnson committed to letting the coaching staff make decisions about the quarterback position. He also said Glenn will "make the right decision with what we’ve got."</p><p>Johnson's relationship with Glenn dates back nearly three decades. The billionaire businessman doubled down on his faith in the Jets head coach.</p><p>"I do believe in Aaron," Johnson said. "I see the way he handles the room. If I were a player, I would respond to him because he’s the real deal. There’s no B.S. There’s no second agendas. What you are hearing is the truth. A lot of times, players don’t get the truth. They get a lot of gobbledygook."</p><p>The 2025 NFL trade deadline is scheduled for Nov. 4. The Jets could be one of the teams looking to acquire or move players as the deadline approaches. Johnson said the front office will explore all options.</p><p>"I think we are looking at every option at all times," Johnson said. "Always scouring what’s going on in football."</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Texas couple was arrested after investigators found the body of their adult special needs son buried in their backyard, according to investigators.</p><p>The remains of Jonathan Kinman, 26, were found when police conducted a welfare check at 433 White Oak Lane in Burleson, according to a social media post from Burleson Police.</p><p>Kinman's mother, December Mitchell, and stepfather, Jonathan Mitchell, were charged with tampering with and fabricating physical evidence to impair a human corpse, which is a second-degree felony. The pair could face additional charges pending an autopsy report and the outcome of the investigation. The two are each being held on a $250,000 bond.</p><p>On Oct. 14, police responded to the home for a welfare check for Kinman, who lived with his mother and stepfather.</p><p>Deputy Police Chief Doug Sandifer said an investigation was launched after a friend of the family reported seeing a confusing Facebook post from the couple mourning the death of Kinman, according to Fox 4.</p><p>Investigators became suspicious after the couple acknowledged Kinman's death but would only give vague information about how he passed, Sandifer said, the outlet noted.</p><p>"The first information was she said he was taken to Hugeley Hospital and pronounced there. We followed up with that and that was not correct," Sandifer said. "The conflicting information definitely led us to believe that something was not as it should be."</p><p>On Oct. 15, police officers returned along with the Texas Rangers and discovered a shallow grave in the backyard.</p><p>Kinman’s body was exhumed and transported to the Tarrant County Medical Examiner’s Office, where an autopsy was performed. The autopsy results are still pending, and a cause of death has not yet been determined.</p><p>It also remains unclear when Kinman died.</p><p>Police said at no point during the investigation did they believe there was any threat to the community.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>MSNBC host Jen Psaki was denounced for her "disgusting" comments Tuesday suggesting Vice President JD Vance's wife Usha is scared of him.</p><p>Psaki made the remarks on the "I've Had It" podcast, where she and the hosts expressed concern over Vance as a member of the Trump administration. </p><p>She suggested Vance was "scarier" than President Donald Trump in some regards, and that Usha Vance may feel similarly.</p><p>"I think the little Manchurian candidate, JD Vance, wants to be president more than anything else," Psaki said. "I always wonder what's going on in the mind of his wife. Like, are you OK? Please blink four times. We'll come over here. We'll save you.</p><p>"And that he's willing to do anything to get there. And your whole iteration you just outlined, I mean, he's scarier in certain ways in some ways. And he's young and ambitious and agile in the sense that he's a chameleon who makes himself whatever he thinks the audience wants to hear from him."</p><p>The podcast episode's description also referenced this joke, stating, "Usha Vance, please blink twice if you need help."</p><p>Several X users called out Psaki's comments as "disgusting" and "vile" for mocking Vance's marriage and suggesting someone was worse than the "worse than Hitler" Trump.</p><p>"Not a good person. At all," Fox News contributor Joe Concha remarked.</p><p>The Libs of TikTok X account wrote, "Unhinged Jen Psaki is now smearing JD Vance, suggesting that his wife, Usha, wants to leave her husband and offers to 'save' her. She also thinks JD Vance is 'scarier' than Donald Trump. @MSNBC should be ashamed to pay her salary."</p><p>Townhall.com writer Amy Curtis commented, "Also, this is an absolutely vile thing to say. Usha Vance is happily married. She made a vow to JD and those words mean something. It’s also an insult to women who are in actual bad marriages."</p><p>"Jen Psuki [sic] must be transferring her own personal issues onto others. @jrpsaki is a dumba-- who has no comprehension of the truth and has to overcompensate for her lack of talent by saying untrue things. Circle back on that, moron," White House director of communications Steven Cheung wrote.</p><p>"I must admit, the pivot to 'JD Vance is worse than Hitler' started earlier than I anticipated," Federalist senior legal correspondent Margot Cleveland joked.</p><p>"A NEW 'Worse than "worse than Hitler"' is on the way!" conservative commentator Doug Powers wrote.</p><p>"Usha is accompanying JD right now in Israel securing the Gaza Peace Deal. Absolutely disgusting comments," Turning Point USA contributor Jack Posebic wrote.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the White House and the vice president's office for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A federal raid in New York City’s Chinatown targeting criminal activity tied to the alleged sale of counterfeit goods turned chaotic Friday as protesters clashed with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, prompting city officials to say they had no role in the operation.</p><p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News that ICE and federal partners conducted a "targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation" on Canal Street focused on criminal activity related to the sale of alleged counterfeit goods. </p><p>"During this law enforcement operation, rioters who were shouting obscenities, became violent and obstructed law enforcement duties, including blocking vehicles and assaulting law enforcement," McLaughlin wrote in a statement. "Already, one rioter has been arrested for assault on a federal officer."</p><p>During a news conference Tuesday night, Murad Awawdeh, vice president of advocacy at the New York Immigration Coalition, said between 15 and 40 vendors were arrested, and at least two locals were taken into custody for protesting and blocking their arrest efforts.</p><p>City officials quickly moved to distance themselves from the raid.</p><p>Mayor Eric Adams’ press secretary, Kayla Mamelak Altus, told Fox News that New York City "never cooperates with federal law enforcement on civil deportation matters, in accordance with local laws," and had "no involvement in this matter."</p><p>"Mayor Adams has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue the American Dream should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals," she said.</p><p>City officials said police were monitoring the situation near Canal Street and 26 Federal Plaza but had "matters under control." However, if circumstances were to escalate and an individual assaults or interferes with a legal law enforcement action, a source said Adams instructed the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to intervene.</p><p>The source added there have been numerous multi-agency enforcement actions on Canal Street this year, and any illegal activity should be addressed by the NYPD.</p><p>"We saw what looked like tanks in our streets," said Jumaane Williams, a New York City public advocate. "We saw people who were armed and in tactical gear for vendors, which was planned. Many of you actually got advance notice that this was going to happen. They were targeting, in this case, Black vendors on Canal Street. That's what occurred… None of this is about public safety. It is about fear and chaos."</p><p>He added that what gives him hope is that, in a few months, he believes "we are going to have a mayor who actually cares about New Yorkers and who will be here joined with us."</p><p>Socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani weighed in on X, calling the Manhattan raid "aggressive and reckless."</p><p>"Federal agents from ICE and HSI—some in military fatigues and masks—descended on Chinatown today in an aggressive and reckless raid on immigrant street vendors," Mamdani wrote in a post. "Once again, the Trump administration chooses authoritarian theatrics that create fear, not safety. It must stop."</p><p>Mamdani's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for further comment.</p><p>"Let's be clear, street vendors are not a national security threat," said New York City Comptroller Brad Lander.They are not a national security threat… There is no excuse for sending military style vehicles and a national law enforcement response for street vendors, whether they were sourced from social media or otherwise."</p><p>DHS said it will release additional details about the criminals arrested as soon as they become available.</p><p>ICE did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he believes New York City could soon elect a "communist" mayor and signaled he’d prefer a Democrat to take the reins at City Hall over a far-left candidate.</p><p>Asked during a White House press gaggle whether he’d urge Republican Curtis Sliwa to drop out of the race, Trump didn’t endorse anyone, but made clear his concern about current polling with just two weeks to go until Election Day.</p><p>"Well, I looked at the polls and looks like we're going to have a communist as the mayor of New York," Trump said. "It'll be very interesting. But here's the good news. He's got to go through the White House, everything goes through the White House. At least this White House, it does."</p><p>Trump appeared to suggest that if Sliwa exited the race, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo might close the gap with Democratic socialist nominee Zohran Mamdani, but wasn’t confident it would change the outcome.</p><p>"If he [Sliwa] dropped out, he's not going to win. And not looking too good for Cuomo either," Trump said. "Maybe if he dropped out, Cuomo would have a little bit of a chance. But not much. Because it looks like the lead is—it’s not a great lead, but it’s big enough that he should be able to win."</p><p>Pressed on whether he’d be willing to meet with Mamdani if elected, Trump said he would.</p><p>"Yeah, I’ll speak to him," the president said. "I think I have an obligation to speak to him."</p><p>Still, Trump lamented what he sees as the city’s decline under progressive leadership.</p><p>"I love New York. I've always loved New York.

<div class="article-title">Giants' Russell Wilson calls Broncos head coach Sean Payton 'classless' after postgame jab</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton gave New York Giants rookie Jaxson Dart his flowers after an epic come-from-behind win for the Broncos Sunday. </p><p>But Payton wanted to face the veteran Super Bowl champion quarterback the Giants have behind Dart, Russell Wilson. </p><p>"They found a little spark with that quarterback," Payton said of Dart during his postgame press conference after Denver's 33-32 victory. "I was talking to [Giants owner] John Mara not too long ago, and I said we were hoping that change would’ve happened long after our game."</p><p>While Payton could’ve simply meant Dart gave his team problems — the Giants held a 26-8 lead late in the fourth quarter before a thrilling comeback — Wilson didn’t appreciate the words from his former Broncos coach. </p><p>These two have obvious history, and Wilson viewed his former head coach’s comments as "classless."</p><p>"Classless… but not surprised… Didn’t realize you’re still bounty hunting 15+ years later through the media," Wilson posted on X with some laughing emoji and his famous #LetsRide hashtag he used while a member of the Broncos from 2022-23. </p><p>Wilson’s "bounty hunting" comment is also a jab at Payton’s scandal while head coach of the New Orleans Saints. The NFL found Payton’s squad guilty of placing a bounty on targeted players, leading to the head coach’s season-long suspension in 2012 as part of the severe punishment from the league. </p><p>The relationship between Wilson and Payton was rocky, to say the least, after the former was traded from the Seattle Seahawks to the Broncos in 2022. It didn’t last long for Wilson. Payton benched him in 2023, and he was released during the 2024 offseason despite Denver taking on a whopping $85 million in dead money. </p><p>Wilson ended up going 11-19 in his starts for Denver with zero playoff appearances. </p><p>Wilson wasn’t happy with his benching in 2023, especially after he said the Broncos threatened to bench him earlier that year if he did not waive an injury guarantee in his contract. Wilson had $37 million guaranteed if he could not pass a physical on the fifth day of the new league year in March 2024. </p><p>Greg Penner, the Broncos’ owner and CEO, denied the team ever threatened Wilson. He said the franchise wanted to negotiate "in good faith" about contract adjustments, though Wilson said he would be getting the NFLPA involved. The NFLPA later sent a letter to the Broncos stating that any threat would be a violation of the league’s CBA. </p><p>Still being paid by the Broncos, Wilson signed a veteran minimum deal for one season with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Giants signed Wilson this past offseason, as well as Jameis Winston, to provide a veteran presence around Dart, who New York traded back in the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft to snag out of Ole Miss.</p><p>Head coach Brian Daboll made it clear all through training camp that Wilson was the starter for his team, but after three straight losses to open the season, the switch was made to Dart. Dart won his first NFL start in a massive upset over the Los Angeles Chargers, the Broncos’ AFC West nemesis, at MetLife Stadium in Week 4. </p><p>Dart and the Giants should’ve been victorious in Denver, too, but a collapse of epic proportions ensued with Wil Lutz drilling a game-winning field goal to cement the biggest comeback win this season in the NFL. </p><p>It remains Dart’s offense for the foreseeable future with Wilson backing him up in New York. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">GOP lawmakers warn Trump's Argentina beef proposal could rattle US ranchers</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A group of House Republicans is raising concerns about the potential effects of the U.S. importing Argentinian beef after President Donald Trump floated the idea earlier this week.</p><p>Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., is leading seven other House GOP lawmakers in a letter to the president on Tuesday evening, warning the potential plan has rattled the multibillion-dollar American ranching industry.</p><p>"America’s cattle producers are among the most resilient and hardworking in the nation," the Republicans wrote. "Collectively, the cattle industry supports thousands of jobs across our districts and contributes $112 billion to rural economies nationwide."</p><p>"In recent days, we have heard strong concerns from producers regarding reports that the U.S. may import beef from Argentina."</p><p>The House Republicans acknowledged the "importance of strong trade relationships and diverse markets" but added that beef producers in their districts "are seeking clarity on how this decision will be made, what safety and inspection standards will apply, and how this policy aligns with your administration’s commitment to strengthening American agriculture."</p><p>Trump suggested Sunday that buying beef from Argentina could help lower prices for Americans at home, amid a wider promise to lower costs for U.S. citizens.</p><p>"One of the things we're thinking about doing is beef from Argentina," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.</p><p>He later elaborated in his conversation with reporters, "We would buy some beef from Argentina. If we do that, that will bring our beef prices down."</p><p>"Our groceries are down, our energy prices are down. I think we're going to have $2 gasoline pretty soon. We're getting close and everything's down. The one thing that's kept up is beef," Trump said.</p><p>He added that it would not be "that much" but argued it would help Argentina, a U.S. ally, as well.</p><p>But the House Republicans questioned whether imported beef would be held to the same food safety and animal health requirements as that of the U.S., which they called "the gold standard."</p><p>"Any import policy must hold foreign suppliers to those same rigorous standards. Introducing beef from countries with inconsistent safety or inspection records could undermine the confidence that U.S. ranchers have worked decades to earn," the lawmakers warned.</p><p>"We respectfully request additional information on this matter and urge your administration to ensure that any future decisions are made with full transparency, sound science, and a firm commitment to the U.S. cattle industry. America’s producers can compete with anyone in the world. If given an opportunity, they will continue to respond quickly to the market demand for more quality American beef in our grocery stores."</p><p>In addition to Fedorchak, the letter is also signed by Reps. Michelle Fischbach, R-Minn., Troy Downing, R-Mont., Gabe Evans, R-Colo., Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., Derek Schmidt, R-Kan., Jeff Hurd, R-Colo., and Republican Study Committee Chair August Pfluger, R-Texas.</p><p>White House spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital in response, "The Trump administration remains committed to addressing the needs and concerns of American cattle producers and safeguarding their interests at home and abroad. That’s why the administration has secured billions in new export opportunities for American agricultural products in our historic trade deals with the UK, Japan, the EU, and others."</p><p>"It’s also why the administration is focused on reversing a prolonged decrease in the supply of live cattle by growing American cattle herds with robust action to deliver disaster relief to cattle country, support new ranchers, and reduce risk for cattle producers," Desai said.</p><p>Trump's proposal has stirred some anxiety among some Republicans whose constituencies depend on cattle ranching.</p><p>Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., posted on X Tuesday, "If the goal is addressing beef prices at the grocery store, this isn’t the way."</p><p>"The U.S. has safe, reliable beef, and it is the one bright spot in our struggling ag economy. Nebraska’s ranchers cannot afford to have the rug pulled out from under them when they’re just getting ahead or simply breaking even," Fischer wrote.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fox News Digital was told that Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., also raised significant concerns about what importing beef from Argentina could do to the U.S. cattle ranching industry during a call with fellow House Republicans on Tuesday.</p><p>But some Republican responses were more muted. Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., told reporters that Trump "definitely identified a problem" regarding a shortage of cattle in the U.S. He added, "I understand what he's trying to get done. I think there's more ways to implement it."</p><p>Fedorchak herself told Fox News Digital, "We’ve all received a number of questions and calls from our constituents over the last few days, so we are asking for clarity on the administration’s long-term plans. Our farmers and ranchers stand ready to deliver on the president’s America-First agenda. North Dakotans take great pride in producing the safest, highest-quality beef in the world — and we should be building on that success."</p></body></div></body></html>

When asked on Tuesday if it would be a mistake for Ingrassia to appear for his hearing, Thune laughed and said, "Yeah."</p><p>Ingrassia, 30, said in a group chat, according to Politico, that he sometimes had a "Nazi streak" in him, and he used the term "moulignon," an Italian slur for Black people, to call for doing away with Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Black History Month.</p><p>The leaked chat was only the latest controversy as Ingrassia has floated around the administration serving in two different roles.</p><p>In July, Ingrassia faced a formal complaint from a lower-ranking female colleague who alleged, according to Politico, that when they arrived at a hotel for a work trip in Orlando, she found she did not have a room and was informed by Ingrassia that she would be sharing one with him. The woman, who did end up sharing a room with him, later retracted the complaint and Ingrassia also disputed it.</p><p>Ingrassia has publicly defended social media influencer and self-described "misogynist" Andrew Tate, and previously worked at a law firm that said he was on Tate’s legal team before his July 2024 admission to the New York bar. Tate and his brother face U.K. charges of rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution for gain, filed by the Crown Prosecution Service in May 2025.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Maine Democratic Senate candidate and former Marine Graham Platner denied he was a "secret Nazi" Monday after revealing he has a tattoo that resembles a Nazi Germany symbol.</p><p>Platner's campaign shared a video with the "Pod Save America" podcast that showed Platner lip-syncing to Miley Cyrus' "Wrecking Ball" at his brother's wedding about a decade ago. In the video, Platner is shirtless and appears to have a skull tattoo on his chest that resembles the "Totenkopf," a symbol of the SS, or Schutzstaffel, under Adolf Hitler.</p><p>"I am not a secret Nazi," Platner said. "Actually, if you read through my Reddit comments, I think you can pretty much figure out where I stand on Nazism and antisemitism and racism in general. I'd say a lifelong opponent."</p><p>Platner said he got the tattoo in a Croatian parlor after getting "very inebriated" with his fellow Marines in 2007. He insisted that skulls and crossbones were a "pretty standard military thing" and that he got the tattoo prior to joining the Army and getting a security clearance. </p><p>"At no point in this entire experience of my life did anybody ever once say, ‘Hey, you're a Nazi,'" Platner said. "It never came up until we got wind that, in the opposition research, somebody was shopping the idea that I was a secret Nazi with a hidden Nazi tattoo. And I can honestly say that if I was trying to hide it, I've not been doing a very good job for the past 18 years."</p><p>Platner quickly faced backlash for the video, including from the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC).</p><p>"This comes less than a week after he was caught: advocating for political violence, saying Black people don’t tip, calling all police ‘bastards,’ calling Maine’s lobstermen 'pieces of s---.' What’s next...," the group wrote on X.</p><p>Although Platner suggested he did not think the symbol meant anything beyond a skull and crossbones, his former political director, Genevieve McDonald, reportedly wrote on Facebook that he "knows damn well what it means."</p><p>"This is seriously the dumbest timeline," McDonald wrote. "Graham has an anti-Semitic tattoo on his chest. He's not an idiot, he's a military history buff. Maybe he didn't know it when he got it, but he got it years ago and he should have had it covered up because he knows damn well what it means.</p><p>"The vault is open for the GOP to f------ crush any dreams we had in the general and literally everyone I know is fighting with each other on social media. We cannot be this painfully stupid."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Platner's campaign and the NRSC for comment.</p><p>Platner, who is attempting to take on longtime Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, recently came under fire last week after Reddit posts of his from 2018 resurfaced. In one post, he wrote that "all" police are bastards and called himself a "communist."</p><p>In a separate post, he argued that if people "expect to fight fascism without a good semi-automatic rifle, they ought to do some reading of history."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Hezbollah’s growing foothold in Latin America has found its epicenter in Venezuela, where U.S. lawmakers and former counterterror officials say the Maduro regime has turned the country into a safe haven for one of the world’s most dangerous terrorist groups, giving it access to drug trafficking routes, forged documents and a gateway to the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>At a Senate Caucus on International Counternarcotics Control hearing this week, both Republican and Democratic senators warned that Hezbollah’s integration into Latin America’s criminal underworld — once concentrated in Colombia and the tri-border region — has now taken root under Venezuela’s protection.</p><p>Witnesses described an illicit web of narcotics, money laundering and passport-for-terrorist schemes that have flourished with state sponsorship, turning Venezuela into what one expert called the "most important facilitator for Hezbollah in Latin America."</p><p>"Venezuela is a willing safe haven for what remains the most lethal, dangerous foreign terrorist organization to the United States," said Marshall Billingslea, a former senior Treasury official.</p><p>Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, both warned that Hezbollah’s 50-year presence in Latin America now poses a hemispheric threat requiring coordinated U.S. action.</p><p>Ambassador Nathan Sales, the former counterterrorism coordinator at the State Department, urged more Latin American nations — especially Brazil and Mexico — to designate Hezbollah in its entirety as a terrorist organization.</p><p>The bipartisan tone, rare in today’s Congress, underscored what lawmakers called a clear and present danger — a sanctioned regime in America’s backyard providing cover to a global terror group.</p><p>"Venezuela has become a key enabler of Hezbollah’s malign activity in our region," Sales testified.</p><p>"This is not just about the Middle East anymore," Cornyn added. "It’s about a terrorist organization embedding itself in the Western Hemisphere under the protection of a hostile regime."</p><p>Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, went a step further, predicting that the United States will move to end Nicolás Maduro’s rule altogether.</p><p>"I think we’re going to free Venezuela," Moreno said. "That will be one of President Trump’s many, many legacies. It’s long past due, and I think his days are numbered." Moreno added that he "would be surprised if [Maduro is] still in Venezuela by the end of this year," signaling growing confidence that Washington could soon pursue regime change in Caracas after seven strikes on alleged narco-traffickers on the seas.</p><p>Billingslea and Cornyn pointed to evidence that Venezuelan officials issued passports to Hezbollah operatives, including accusations that former Vice President Tareck El Aissami helped militants travel freely across the region.</p><p>According to Billingslea, more than 10,000 passports were issued to individuals from Syria, Lebanon and Iran under the former Venezuelan vice president, some with known Hezbollah or Hamas ties.</p><p>The system, witnesses said, allowed operatives to disguise identities, launder funds and even move into the U.S. with false papers.</p><p>Sales detailed how Hezbollah’s operations have become embedded in the regional drug trade, including the trafficking of so-called "black cocaine" compressed into charcoal-like briquettes to avoid detection.</p><p>"Hezbollah traffics narcotics through criminal networks active in the tri-border area. … It’s particularly involved in the sale of black cocaine," Sales said.</p><p>He and others warned that as sanctions squeeze Iran and Hezbollah’s financial channels in the Middle East, the group is relying more heavily on Latin American drug profits to sustain itself.</p><p>Matthew Levitt of the Washington Institute said Venezuela has effectively joined what he called the "axis of evasion," a global sanctions-defying network linking Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.</p><p>"Venezuela plays an important part in this illicit network as it reaches the Western Hemisphere," Levitt said, describing its role in gold smuggling, oil-for-cash deals and financial cover for Iran and Hezbollah.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A North Carolina man says he was shot at by an angry motorist who tore down a Trump banner in his mother’s front yard, an incident he believes reflects the nation’s growing political hostility.</p><p>Mark Thomas, who owns a river rafting business in the Nantahala Gorge, said he was relaxing at home on Sept. 6 when the shooting occurred.</p><p>Thomas told Fox News Digital he checked his security cameras after seeing a man wearing an "Antifa-style mask" step out of a Jeep Cherokee to look at a Trump banner attached to a bus parked near his 87-year-old mother’s home. </p><p>The man, identified by police as Benjamin Michael Campbell, 38, was allegedly speeding before abruptly stopping and removing the banner.</p><p>"Being a Second Amendment believer, I reached over, grabbed my rifle and took off out there to the porch," Thomas said.</p><p>Thomas said he fired two warning shots into the air before Campbell allegedly got back into his vehicle and opened fire through the sunroof. Campbell then fled — only to return moments later and fire several more shots, striking a refrigerator inside the home, Thomas said.</p><p>Campbell, an Atlanta-based accountant, fled before police arrived. He was arrested Sept. 30 and extradited to North Carolina, where he faces charges including felony assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill or inflict serious injury, discharging a firearm within an enclosure to incite fear and willful and wanton injury to personal property.</p><p>Thomas said he was stunned to learn the suspect was a professional in his late 30s.</p><p>"Some of these people, they just see a Trump sign, and they just snap," he said. "The whole time I’m thinking, ‘This is some 20-year-old kid, and he’s going to figure it out eventually'.</p><p>"That was really my hesitation," he added. "I thought, ‘You know, son, you’re going to live another day.’ And I came to find out this guy is 38 years old and an accountant out here in a full Antifa outfit."</p><p>Thomas said he almost didn’t call the police after the first round of shots but changed his mind when Campbell returned and opened fire again.</p><p>He added that his mother had several other Trump signs on her property that Campbell never saw.</p><p>"His head would have just completely exploded," Thomas said.</p><p>Thomas also noted that he had no intention of harming Campbell, citing the shooter’s poor aim.</p><p>"The only thing that saved his life was the fact that he couldn’t shoot that well," he said. "You would’ve had to hit me pretty good to get me to not do what I was ready to do."</p><p>The shooting happened four days before the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, an incident that Thomas said "really woke people up" to the violence happening amid deep political divisions across the country. </p><p>He claimed some Democratic officials have publicly encouraged hostility toward conservatives, further fueling divisions.</p><p>Thomas said he hopes to one day speak with Campbell to understand what motivated the attack.</p><p>"I’d really like to talk to that guy and find out what’s in his head," Thomas said. "I’d like him to look at the video and see me standing on my porch and realize how close he came to losing his life over a banner.</p><p>"I swear I’ve thought about putting $10 on his (jail) account and getting him to call me."</p></body></div></body></html>

After a successful hearing to get my bail conditions lifted (one which the police officer in charge of the case didn't even bother to attend) the Crown Prosecution Service has dropped the case," he announced.</p><p>Linehan was arrested Sept. 1 by five armed officers on suspicion of inciting violence with three posts on X that criticized transgender activists.</p><p>One of the posts read, "If a trans-identified male is in a female-only space, he is committing a violent, abusive act.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A month after co-founder Charlie Kirk's assassination in Utah, the faith arm of Turning Point USA (TPUSA) has doubled its church network, while drawing in hundreds of thousands of new followers nationwide.</p><p>TPUSA spokesman Andrew Kolvet confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that its church network has reached 8,000 in one of the largest growth spikes in the organization’s history.</p><p>Kolvet added that more than 200,000 new Christians have become involved with TPUSA Faith nationwide, and the organization’s social media accounts have seen over 1,000% growth across followers, views and streams in the past month.</p><p>Appearing on "The Story," Kolvet told host Trace Gallagher, "TPUSA Faith, which Charlie launched during COVID, has — so just to put it in perspective, we had about 4,000 churches in the network before 9/10. We have added over 4,000 more churches. </p><p>"So, now we've doubled. We have 8,000 churches in our network at TPUSA Faith. We've seen almost 1,000% growth across all social media platforms. And get this. We've had over 200,000 people sign up to become a part of TPUSA Faith.</p><p>"So, what we're doing in the faith space has more than doubled, and it's, again, what a testament to the legacy that Charlie Kirk has left. There's just so much more good than there is bad, and it's important for us to remind everybody about that," Kolvet added.</p><p>Kolvet said the growth reflects a revival-like response among church communities nationwide.</p><p>"It's really encouraging for me just to see the pure raw numbers of that because you can feel it. There's so many anecdotes and so many people that have come to us, sent us emails," he said. "You see it in the social media comments saying, 'Charlie re-inspired my faith. I'm going back to church. I'm praying for my husband. Our marriage has been saved because of the legacy that … and just the way Charlie lived his life."</p><p>TPUSA Faith offers resources such as prayer groups, faith courses and a monthly devotional.</p><p>According to its mission statement, "TPUSA Faith is dedicated to empowering Christians to put their faith into action. We engage, equip, and empower millions of grateful Americans who are prepared to defend our God-given rights, by giving them the tools to expose lies and articulate the connection between Faith and Freedom."</p><p>Kolvet said he credits the growth to "the way Charlie would integrate the message of faith into everything that he did."</p><p>"[Charlie would] get a question about, regardless of the topic, he would get a question, and he would find a way to integrate his faith just seamlessly into that," Kolvet said. "And after, you know, Charlie was assassinated, people started seeing these clips, and they would realize just what he was doing with all of those interactions that he had one by one over the years and how so much wisdom was packed into these social media videos that now people are rediscovering.</p><p>"And then they hear about the way he lived his life or loved Erica, his wife, or his kids, and they realized that there is true wisdom here and a future and a purpose for them.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The state of Arizona is suing Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., over the delayed swearing-in of Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz.</p><p>"Speaker Mike Johnson is actively stripping the people of Arizona of one of their seats in Congress and disenfranchising the voters of Arizona’s seventh Congressional district in the process," Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, said in a statement. </p><p>"By blocking Adelita Grijalva from taking her rightful oath of office, he is subjecting Arizona’s seventh Congressional district to taxation without representation. I will not allow Arizonans to be silenced or treated as second-class citizens in their own democracy."</p><p>Johnson dismissed the lawsuit as a bid to get "national publicity" in comments to reporters earlier this week and on Tuesday evening.</p><p>"I think it’s patently absurd. We run the House. She has no jurisdiction. We’re following the precedent," Johnson said in response to the state attorney general. "She’s looking for national publicity, apparently she’s gotten some of it, but good luck with that."</p><p>Grijalva won a special election on Sept. 23 to replace her father, late Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., after he passed away from cancer at age 77.</p><p>Johnson has repeatedly said that Grijalva will be sworn into office when the House returns to its regular sessions. But it's not clear when exactly that will be — the House GOP leader has threatened to keep his lawmakers out of Washington, D.C., until the ongoing government shutdown is over.</p><p>It's a bid to pressure Senate Democrats, led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to agree to the GOP's plan to fund the federal government through Nov. 21.</p><p>But Schumer and his allies have resisted thus far, sinking the Republican-led bill 11 times and keeping the shutdown going for 21 days.</p><p>House Democrats have accused Johnson of playing politics and depriving Arizona's 7th Congressional District of representation in the process.</p><p>"Republicans on vacation for four weeks — and one of the consequences of that is that Republicans have refused, now for four consecutive weeks, to swear in Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva, depriving hundreds of thousands of people in the state of Arizona of the representation that they deserve, particularly during this challenging moment in the country," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said during a press conference on Tuesday.</p><p>Johnson, in response to Democrats' criticism, has repeatedly pointed out that the House was not in session when Grijalva won her election.</p><p>He's also argued that he was following precedent set by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who waited 25 days to swear in Rep. Julia Letlow, R-La., in 2021.</p><p>Letlow had won a special election to replace her husband, Rep.-elect Luke Letlow, R-La., who died during the COVID-19 pandemic before he could be sworn into office in January 2021.</p><p>"We are not in legislative session. The chronology is important. Rep. Grijalva won her race, I think it was the last week of September, after we had already gone out of session. So I will administer the oath to her, I hope, on the first day we come back," Johnson said.</p><p>"I'm willing and anxious to do that. In the meantime, instead of doing TikTok videos, she should be serving her constituents."</p><p>Grijalva has argued she cannot perform her legislative or constituent duties without being sworn in first, which Johnson and Republicans have disputed.</p><p>But her swearing-in is also key to the ongoing battle over Jeffrey Epstein documents going on in the House.</p><p>Once made a member of Congress, Grijalva is expected to be the deciding signature on a measure aimed at forcing a House-wide vote on releasing Epstein documents in the Department of Justice's (DOJ) possession.</p><p>The measure, called a discharge petition, is designed to end-run House leaders on specific legislation — provided it has a majority of lawmakers' signatures.</p><p>Johnson and House GOP leaders have called the measure superfluous and political, pointing to the chamber's own ongoing investigation and procedures aimed at widening transparency into Epstein's case.</p><p>However, the speaker has signaled he would not block the measure if it came to the House floor when Grijalva was sworn in.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Johnson for a response but did not immediately hear back.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Historic preservation group fears ballroom annex will overwhelm White House</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit chartered by Congress to further the historic preservation policy in the U.S., has written a letter urging the Trump administration to pause the <span class="link">demolition</span> of the East Wing of the White House until a review of President Trump's ballroom plans is completed. </p><p>The letter, sent Tuesday and addressed to the National Capital Planning Commission, National Park Service and Commission of Fine Arts, voices concern about the size of the ballroom annex — that "the proposed new construction will overwhelm the White House itself."</p><p>The Trust has no statutory authority to compel the Trump administration to halt construction. </p><p>"We respectfully urge the Administration and the National Park Service to pause demolition until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes, including consultation and review by the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, and to invite comment from the public," it says.</p>
<p>Last week, the Society of Architectural Historians raised similar concerns about the size of the ballroom and its impact on White House grounds. </p>
<p>And in August, a letter from the American Institute of Architects also focused on the ballroom's size. "The proposed 90,000-square-foot addition raises concerns regarding scale and balance. The design absolutely must harmonize with the White House's existing architectural proportions."</p><p>The Society of Architectural Historians and the American Institute of Architects may make recommendations but have no statutory role in the design or construction of the ballroom. </p><p>The White House has not responded to the concerns raised by the three groups, but in a statement Tuesday made reference to "manufactured outrage, unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies" who it said "are clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House."</p><p>The statement also said the ballroom would "significantly increase the White House's capacity to host major functions honoring world leaders, foreign nations, and other dignitaries."</p>

<div class="article-title">White House begins demolition of part of East Wing for Trump's ballroom</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington </em>— Demolition on the White House's East Wing has begun, although President Trump previously said his ballroom addition to the White House wouldn't "interfere" with the building's existing structure.</p><p>The Washington Post first reported on the demolition and published an image of the work. And on Monday, a pool reporter captured video of part of the East Wing being torn down. </p><p>During an event Monday with the Louisiana State University baseball team at the White House, the president remarked on the construction, which he said "just started today."</p><p>"You know we're building — right behind us — we're building a ballroom," Mr. Trump said during the celebration of the 2025 NCAA champions in the White House East Room. He pointed out, "Right on the other side, you have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically."</p><p>The president also referenced the construction during a meeting with GOP senators on the Rose Garden patio Tuesday. Mr. Trump overhauled the Rose Garden and covered the grass earlier this year to make it easier to host guests.</p>
<p>"You probably hear the beautiful sound of construction in the back," he said. "You hear that sound? Oh, that's music to my ears, I love that sound. Other people don't like it. I love it ... I think when I hear that sound, it reminds me of money. In this case, it reminds me of lack of money, because I'm paying for it."</p>
<p>The president told reporters in September that construction had begun, though at the time, no part of the White House building had been demolished.</p><p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shared a social media post by Mr. Trump Monday announcing that "ground has been broken" for the "new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom."</p><p>"For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State visits, etc.," Mr. Trump said in the post. "I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway — with zero cost to the American Taxpayer!"</p>
<p>The East Wing of the White House is fairly small and is where the first lady's office and staff are located.</p><p>"It won't interfere with the current building," the president said in July. "It won't be. It'll be near it but not touching it — and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of."</p><p>The White House says the project, which will cost $250 million, has been fully funded by private contributions from business and big tech, including Apple, Microsoft and Coinbase. Earlier this month, ballroom donors dined at the White House with Mr. Trump. </p><p>By September, a number of companies had pledged to donate $5 million or more for the addition, multiple sources familiar with the matter said. </p><p>The addition was originally planned to be 90,000 square feet, but that figure is likely to increase. The ballroom, which will be used for events that on occasion will include heads of state, is intended to hold 999 people, up from an initial estimate of 650. Mr. Trump said it will have bulletproof glass windows on all sides. </p><p>The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a D.C.-based nonprofit chartered by Congress that works to protect historical sites, wrote a letter Tuesday urging a "pause" to "demolition until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes."</p><p>The letter was addressed to the National Capital Planning Commission, the National Park Service and the Commission of Fine Arts.</p>
<p>"While the National Trust acknowledges the utility of a larger meeting space at the White House, we are deeply concerned that the massing and height of the proposed new construction will overwhelm the White House itself—it is 55,000 square feet—and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings," the National Trust wrote. </p><p>CBS News previously obtained <span class="link">renderings</span> of the ballroom. </p>

<div class="article-title">Tropical Storm Melissa forms in the Atlantic. Maps show forecast path.</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said Tuesday morning. </p><p>Melissa, the 13th named storm in the Atlantic this year, is not expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States, but there is uncertainty on its path and intensity, the hurricane center said.</p><p>Here's what to know about Tropical Storm Melissa. </p>
<h2>Tropical Storm Melissa forecast and path</h2><p>As of Tuesday night, the storm was about 325 miles south-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and moving west at about 13 mph, the hurricane center said. Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph, according to the center, with tropical storm force winds extending outwards up to 140 miles from the center of the storm. </p><p>Melissa was expected to bring "heavy rains" to Haiti and the Dominican Republic through at least Friday, the hurricane center forecast, with rainfall totals of up to 10 inches. </p><p>Aruba, Puerto Rico and Jamaica could see up to 3 inches of rain through Friday, the hurricane center said. </p>
<p>A gradual turn to the north and northwest is expected in the coming days, the agency said. The storm is expected to decrease in speed and may linger over the Caribbean thanks to weakening steering currents.</p>

<div class="article-title">In new interview, Santos says time in prison "wasn't nice," describes Trump call</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><span class="link">Disgraced former Rep. George Santos</span> described <span class="link">his time in prison</span>, writing suicide notes, a conversation with President Trump and  more in a wide-ranging interview Tuesday.  </p><p>Santos spoke with CBS News New York's Marcia Kramer following <span class="link">the commutation of his sentence</span>. He told her he found out his sentence had been commuted from fellow inmates who were watching television.   </p><p>Santos told CBS News New York he wasn't aware that he might still face legal jeopardy locally despite his federal sentence being commuted. </p><h2>Santos' apology</h2><p>"First and foremost, I'm sorry. I owe so many people apologies. I owe my former constituents who I let down," Santos said. </p><p>He also named Republican party leaders on Long Island and New York, saying he owes them apologies too. </p>
<p>"I betrayed their trust. I betrayed my former colleagues' trust in the House of Representatives, both Republicans and Democrats, but most importantly I want to focus on my Republican colleagues because we're one team. I betrayed their trust. I understand your fury. I am sorry I caused them so much grief and so much heartache," Santos said. "I know talk is cheap. I just want everyone back home to know - please, judge me by the actions moving forward. I have been given an opportunity to rewrite the ending of my life, and I will make sure that is as honorable as humanly possible, and above reproach at all times, because it would be an absolute ungodly irresponsibility to not take advantage of this, and do it in the best way possible. I just want to do good." </p><h2>Santos on his time in prison</h2><p>Santos said being in prison "wasn't nice." </p><p>He was sent to prison at Federal Correctional Institution Fairton in New Jersey. He critiqued prison officials for how his arrival was handled. </p><p>"The first night was tough. No one truly prepares for something like this," Santos said. "Imagine a dorm at a camp you really don't want to be at and it's been run down so bad but your parents really force you because they want to get rid of you for the summer - it's kind of the same." </p>
<p>He went on to describe the tension he felt surrounding his arrival.</p><p>"From the get go, they did everything wrong, in my opinion, on how they dealt with bringing in a person into prison. Usually, people come in and nobody even knows there's a new guy. But for me, they shut down the camp, they shut down the facility, they took people and put them all indoors, made them stand up for a count so I can walk in. Kicked people out of their beds and shifted people around so I can have this, I guess, privileged spot bed, as if there was a difference between any of the other beds. I guess they were just trying to be overzealous and protective in their nature, and they created an environment that could've become hostile if I didn't have the personality to navigate it. But it was tough," Santos said. </p><p>Santos said he spent 41 days in isolation due to death threats, in a cell that he says was fewer than six feet wide and nine feet high. He was kept in that cell 23 hours a day, with one hour of outdoor recreation time during weekdays. He said he stood outdoors in the rain just to stay out of that cell for that hour. </p><p>"It was mentally torturous," Santos said. </p><p>Santos said he was given three books a week. He said he was allowed to shower three times a week.</p><p>"It's a really dirty environment," Santos said. </p><p>CBS News New York has reached out to FCI Fairton for a response to Santos' claims. </p>
<h2>Santos says he wrote suicide notes</h2><p>He said he wrote three suicide notes. </p><p>"I wanted to document my feelings in case I felt short and weak and did it," Santos said. "Three different times. I wrote three different letters." </p><p>Santos said he considered hanging himself in his cell, and prayer helped him survive. </p><p>"I decided not to do it all three times ... I want to say God intervened every time. And I stuck to that," Santos said.</p><h2>Watch additional interview excerpts</h2>
<h2>On his commutation</h2><p>Santos said he found out about his commutation from other prisoners who were watching television. </p><p>"The inmates found out and started screaming for me to come," Santos said. </p><p>He said he left prison six hours later. </p>
<p>"My husband spoke to the president before I did," Santos said. </p><p>Santos said he gave his prison clothes to fellow prisoners who needed it the most. </p><p>"I just walked out with my letters, my bible, my rosary and pictures that I had from my family," Santos said. "I received hundreds of letters from people all around the country wishing me well. America is a place for second chances. Everybody in this country is programmed to allow and give grace. That's our culture, as Americans, and I saw that in how people would send me the kindest letters." </p><p>Santos said his commutation by the president left him "humbled." </p><p>"It's not about what I think, it's about what President Trump thinks as he did, and I am humbled and grateful for it," Santos said. </p><p>Santos pointed out <span class="link">President Biden pardoned his whole family, along with Dr. Anthony Fauci</span>. </p><p>Santos said he "fell apart" when he saw his husband and sister when he left prison. </p>
<p>"There's nothing to say, other than cry," Santos said. "In my wildest dreams, I didn't think I'd spend the holidays at home with them." </p><p>He says the first thing he did when he got home was take a long shower. His first meal outside of prison was sushi - he wanted something really fresh. </p><h2>On his conversation with President Trump</h2><p>Santos said he spoke with President Trump Saturday. So what did he tell him?</p><p>"I want to contribute," Santos said. "I want to make a difference. I want to work from the outside. I think that's how important this is, especially for our youth. That's the main focus, because that's the root cause." </p><p>Santos said cities like Chicago and Detroit, the main opportunities for many young people are in crime. </p><p>"That's where we have to target, is working with these children so that they don't go to prison," Santos said. "You don't want to go to prison, kids. That's the message." </p><p>Santos said his call with President Trump was meaningful. </p>
<p>"This was my first one-on-one with any president," Santos said. "Any sitting president of the United States, it would've been an honor. But to have the one that I've dedicated 10 years of supporting made it that much more special." </p><h2>On potential future legal challenges </h2><p>Under a 2019 law <span class="link">inspired by Paul Manafort</span>, New York state and local prosecutors can still bring charges against people who have received commutations from the president. So does Santos think he's out of the woods?</p><p>"It hasn't crossed my mind. Like I said, I have no pendencies with them ... my entire case was federal. Not that I'm aware of, I don't even know how'd they would do it," Santos said. "I mean, you're putting that thought in my head now, so I probably have to go look into it, but I would hope that that's not the priority, the path that people would want to go down." </p><p>Nassau County DA Anne Donnelly released a statement Tuesday indicating it's a possibility. </p><p>"Since first learning of George Santos' actions, I have been at the forefront of bringing him to justice. I am proud of the work my office has done, and the conviction achieved in partnership with the U.S. Attorney's office. While the office cannot comment on ongoing investigations, suffice it to say that I remain focused on prosecuting political corruption wherever it exists regardless of political affiliation," Donnelly said.</p><p>His reaction?</p><p>"I wasn't even aware of the statement Marcia," Santos said. "I would fall short of words." </p>
<p>"Obviously, it raises concerns, for me," he added. </p><h2>Santos says he takes responsibility for his crimes, but... </h2><p>"I believe I have made some very poor choices. I believe I have made some awful mistakes. I've hurt people. I don't believe I should've been treated the way I was in prison. I don't believe prison should be the way it is in our country," Santos said. "I certainly, like many Americans in a bipartisan fashion, agree that my sentence and my entire process was over-politicized by a weaponized DOJ." </p><p>Santos said <span class="link">former Attorney General Merrick Garland</span> was "unhinged" and "trying to settle scores." </p><p>Santos said he thinks he got a stiffer sentence because of the notoriety of his case. </p><p>"I believe the DOJ was specifically targeting me because I flipped a seat after almost 30 years of Democrat control, and they had a window because I gave them that window, because I was so self-destructive to myself, Marcia. So, that being said, it's obviously my fault, it's my own doing, but they were overzealous because of political expedience and convenience," Santos said. </p><p>Santos says while he accepts responsibility for his crimes, people have a narrative about them that's inaccurate.</p><p>"I'm going to be forever targeted and having to live with people believing that I went out there and stole people's credit cards physically and used them on shopping sprees when that did not happen," Santos said. "That never happened. It's not a fact." </p>
<p>Santos said he had "bad and very irresponsible accounting" on his campaign. </p><p>"There were things that money was spent on that was not allowed. I take all responsibility, Marcia, the buck stops with me. But there were multiple steps to how that all happened. And I am here standing, and I take responsibility, because I want to move forward. There's no point in rehashing the past. That's already been adjudicated, right? I was granted a second lease on life and I want to use that to do good. I know what I shouldn't do. I have this insane experience that I just went through for 84 days, and I'm grateful for the clemency offered to me by President Trump, and I want to take that and use this opportunity to just do good," Santos said. </p><h2>Santos says he wants to work on prison reform</h2><p>Santos said he wants work on prison reform and helping troubled youth. </p><p>"We're not rehabilitating prisoners, hence our recidivism rate is through the roof," Santos said. "We need to change the way we do prison in our country." </p><p>Santos said he's planning to talk to Bureau of Prisons officials about his experiences. Santos said however he would rather work with an existing prison reform organization than start one of his own. </p><p>"I don't want the responsibility of managing finances. That is something I do not want," Santos said. "I don't want that scrutiny. I don't want that responsibility. I want to do the work without having to take on all the brunt, right? Lobbying is not something I want to do, but I would love to do advocacy, which is two very different things." </p><p>"The best platform is to partner with a productive and effective organization, which I have a list of some that I'm already interested in. I'm speaking to two of them this week," Santos added.</p>
<p>He said he wants to reduce the prison population not by letting people out but by "truly rehabilitating them and reducing this obsession of sending people to prison for long periods of time when you can put them on house arrest, community service, fine them if they're wealthy people." </p><p>Santos said there's a difference between white collar and violent criminals, and made clear he is not advocating for house arrest for violent prisoners. </p><p>"But I am advocating that that person is treated with dignity, and that they are given an opportunity for programs to better themselves, to have true rehabilitation with mental health programs and actually staffing an adequate amount of real medical professionals in prisons, not faux medical professionals, like I experienced," Santos said. </p><h2>On his ability to earn a living</h2><p>Santos said he still works as a columnist and he has "other endeavors of business that I am engaged in that yield me income." </p><p>A big lesson he learned?</p><p>"Wealth is not material. Wealth is your family," Santos said. "That is the biggest lesson. I can forgo every jewelry, watch, you name it, name brand clothes and luxury that I have so long as I can have my family and they're healthy." </p><p>Santos said he has no plans to seek office "in the near future." </p>
<p>"Not now," he said. </p>

<div class="article-title">National Guard troops expected in New Orleans by late November</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>New Orleans</em> — National Guard troops are expected to arrive in the Big Easy before the end of November, Anne Kirkpatrick, the city's police superintendent, told CBS News, adding that she had a "good conversation" with a National Guard major recently about the plans.</p><p>"We are working together and planning their deployment," Kirkpatrick told CBS News in an interview Tuesday evening. "They are not coming in to take us over —  this is a partnership." </p><p>While New Orleans had requested Louisiana National Guard support for upcoming New Year's Eve events, the earlier assistance from federal National Guard troops came at the request of Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry in late September. </p><p>Kirkpatrick said the troops are scheduled to arrive in time for the city's Bayou Classic — a major two-day college football event held at Caesars Superdome from Nov. 27 through Nov. 29 featuring Grambling State and Southern University. The troops are expected to remain in the city through New Year's Eve and Mardi Gras in February and will patrol between those events as well. </p><p>National Guard troops were previously deployed to New Orleans at the beginning of the year following <span class="link">a New Year's Day terror attack</span> that killed 14 people on Bourbon Street in the city's iconic French Quarter district. Super Bowl LIX <span class="link">was held in New Orleans</span> in February, drawing heightened security. </p>
<p>"If you remove the politics out of that, our relationships were already established. We've had excellent working relationships with the National Guard," Kirkpatrick said. "My number one mission is to safety, and if National Guard can advance and be a force multiplier, great."</p><p>Recently, the federal government has sent National Guard troops to other U.S. cities — including <span class="link">Los Angeles</span>, <span class="link">Chicago</span> and <span class="link">Portland, Oregon</span> — in response to protests over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. </p><p>In New Orleans, crime is down in almost every category compared to last year, according to crime statistics provided by the New Orleans Police Department. </p><p>Kirkpatrick spoke to CBS News during the city's annual Night Out Against Crime event, which aims to bridge divides between community members and various law enforcement agencies. </p>
<p>The New Orleans Police Department is currently understaffed, Kirpatrick said. A DJ at the event spoke over the loudspeaker encouraging people to consider either signing up for the police academy or as a deputy with the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office. </p>
<p>The city still needs about 300 more police officers, a New Orleans Police Department spokesperson told CBS News. </p><p>Regardless, asked if she thinks Guard troops should be deployed to New Orleans outside of assisting with a major event, Kirkpatrick responded, "I don't." </p><p>"We are peacemakers and soldiers are trained to engage in enemy combat. Our community is not our enemy, but they are here to help support us in law enforcement functions for specific results," Kirkpatrick said. "I am not confused about our different missions, but there's some things we can overlap on and indeed work collaboratively."</p><p>Meanwhile, the city said 20 more officers are set to graduate the police academy this Friday. </p>

<div class="article-title">Copper wire theft is leaving LA in the dark. How a new law could fix the problem</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>As surging copper wire thefts are leaving many Los Angeles communities in the dark, a new statewide metal theft law set to kick in next year is aimed at recyclers who buy the stolen metal.</p><p>Los Angeles city leaders, law enforcement and business leaders <span class="link">called on Gov. Gavin Newsom</span> tosign Assembly Bill 476 as copper wire theft has cost communities not only money, but safety. </p><p>The Sixth Street Bridge in downtown Los Angeles, originally called the "Ribbon of Light," is a glaring example, as it sits in darkness with seven miles of copper wire stolen and stripped from the 2023-built bridge. </p><p>While the stolen copper is valued at $11,000, repairs to rewire it for lighting are estimated to cost over $2.5 million – and have yet to be completed.</p><p>Similar wire theft crime scenes play out throughout the county, including around the Cahuenga Pass. Joy Taylor says her streetlights have been out for eight months, since February.</p>
<p>"I not only worry about cars not seeing us, but we have a lot of wildlife in this neighborhood, and there's coyotes that are coming through the area," Taylor said.</p><p>In Encino, five streetlights are out of commission on a single block, leaving one couple to alter their evening walks with their aging father because of it. </p><p>"Unfortunately, because of the cracks in the sidewalk, my dad's 83 years old, he can't see, and you know, myself as well, I will trip on the cracks. You just can't walk at night, you can't when it's pitch black," Elayne said.</p><p>CBS News California Investigates obtained and analyzed city data and found that there have been more than 37,000 streetlight repair requests made so far in 2025. As of September, more than half are still waiting for service.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Street Lighting said through an email statement that 15% of the system is affected by outages.</p><p>LA County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said that broken streetlights have life and death consequences. He noted the downtown Los Angeles <span class="link">shooting death of actor Johnny Wactor</span>.</p><p>"He got killed because three individuals were trying to steal his catalytic converter. But why did they choose Johnny Wactor's car at 3 a.m. at that exact spot?  Because the streetlights were out  — it was dark," Hochman said. </p><p>The Bureau says nearly half of its service requests are due to wire theft, and the other half are routine maintenance. This leads to a nine to 12-month period before repairs can be made, as there are less than 200 field staff to cover the city's quarter of a million streetlights.</p><p>Los Angeles Councilmember Nithya Raman represents the district that includes the Cahuenga Pass and she said she is constantly getting calls about broken streetlights. "To me, it's unacceptable that it takes up to a year to fix a broken streetlight," Raman said. </p><p>She's calling for an update to property assessment rates, to fund streetlight maintenance as the fees haven't been adjusted since the 90s.</p><p>Neighbors in the Cahuenga Pass have taken matters into their own hands by pooling money to install their own streetlights. Residents Martha Carr and Joy Taylor said they aren't waiting for the city to come to the rescue, and instead are subsidizing a city service with two motion-activated lights.</p>
<p>"Well, in a strange way, I felt empowered that I was able to do something myself, but I shouldn't have to," Carr said. </p><p>Mayor Karen Bass' Office responded by email, saying the city is "embracing new and innovative technologies like solar lighting," moving away from copper wire. "Mayor Bass has begun that work as hundreds of solar streetlights have been installed," the Mayor's Office wrote.</p><p>Assembly member Mark González authored AB 476, stating that "Copper wire theft is not a victim-less crime."</p><p>The bill puts more responsibility on junk dealers when purchasing scrap metal, leaving thieves with fewer options when selling. Buyers will be required to verify the seller's identity and lawful ownership.  Certain scrap metal from streetlights and traffic signals will be illegal to possess, and the bill also increases penalties for recyclers who purchase materials that belong to public entities without ensuring the seller has proper authorization to do so.</p><p>"Every stolen wire is more than metal ripped from the ground; it's light ripped from our communities," González said. </p><p>On Tuesday, the city council approved <span class="link">a Metal and Wire Theft Reward Program</span> that, if given final approval by Bass, would offer rewards of $5,000 for information leading to felony grand theft charges, and $1,000 for misdemeanor charges involving city-owned metal thefts, including copper wiring, plaques, streetlight parts and more. </p>

<div class="article-title">Paul Ingrassia out as Trump nominee after offensive text allegations</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Paul Ingrassia is no longer President Trump's pick to lead the Office of Special Counsel, a White House official told CBS News, after allegations surfaced that he sent offensive text messages, including one where he reportedly conceded he has "a Nazi streak" — leading some GOP senators  to back away from him.</p><p>Ingrassia wrote on X that he's withdrawing from a Thursday morning Senate hearing because "unfortunately I do not have enough Republican votes at this time." He said he "will continue to serve President Trump and this administration to Make America Great Again." He did not mention the text messages, which were published this week by Politico. Ingrassia has previously served as the White House's liaison to the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>Mr. Trump nominated the 30-year-old attorney to lead the Office of Special Counsel in May, calling him a "highly respected attorney, writer, and Constitutional Scholar." The office — which handles whistleblower complaints and investigates misconduct involving the federal workforce — has lacked a Senate-confirmed leader since Mr. Trump <span class="link">fired</span> former head Hampton Dellinger. </p><p>Ingrassia has faced bipartisan blowback since Politico reported Monday on incendiary texts that he allegedly sent in a group chat, including ones where he purportedly called Martin Luther King Jr. "the 1960s George Floyd" and said he has "a Nazi streak in me from time to time."</p><p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters he didn't think Ingrassia will be confirmed, according to the Associated Press, after multiple Republican senators indicated that they would not support him.</p>
<p>"He's not going to pass," Thune said.</p><p>Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told CBS News' chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on Tuesday that Ingrassia's alleged texts are "disqualifying to me," noting that Politico reported the messages were sent within the last year.</p><p>Ingrassia's lawyer, Edward Paltzik, told CBS News, "We do not concede the authenticity of any of these purported messages," citing the risk of manipulation by artificial intelligence.</p><p>He continued that even if the texts are real, "they clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humor making fun of the fact that liberals outlandishly and routinely call MAGA supporters 'Nazis.' In reality, Mr. Ingrassia has incredible support from the Jewish community because Jews know that Mr. Ingrassia is the furthest thing from a Nazi."</p>
<p>CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.</p><p>Ingrassia has drawn controversy in the past, including for social media posts seemingly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and calling for Jan. 6 to be made a national holiday. He also once criticized the group Turning Point USA for kicking out Nick Fuentes, who has a history of white nationalist and antisemitic comments, arguing conservatives should "allow for dissident voices."</p><p>Politico has also reported on an allegation that Igrassia sexually harassed a coworker within the Trump administration. Paltzik said in a statement his client "has never harassed any coworkers — female or otherwise, sexually or otherwise — in connection with any employment."</p><p>Even before Politico's report on Ingrassia's texts, GOP Sen. Thom Tillis had told media outlets that he did not support his nomination, citing his sympathy for Jan. 6 rioters.</p>

<p>Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy criticized Democrats for declining to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government open with no strings attached.</p><p>"I call it the 'Seinfeld' shutdown because it's a shutdown about nothing," the California Republican told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett, referencing the common joke that the seminal sitcom was a "show about nothing." </p><p>McCarthy called the current impasse "the reverse [of] where Republicans were in 2013," when some GOP lawmakers <span class="link">pressed for a spending bill</span> that would roll back the Affordable Care Act, while Democrats pushed for a "clean" bill to fund the government. The government ultimately <span class="link">shut down for 16 days</span> before Republicans ceded to Democrats.</p><p>This year, Republicans are the ones <span class="link">pushing for a clean bill</span> that would keep the government open at existing spending levels, while Democrats <span class="link">are asking for</span> extensions to expiring health insurance subsidies and a rollback of Medicaid restrictions passed earlier this year.</p><p>Democrats say negotiations over health insurance tax credits are necessary immediately to <span class="link">prevent millions of people from facing higher premiums</span>. Republican leaders say they're willing to negotiate on health care, but only after the shutdown ends.</p>
<p>McCarthy argued Democratic leaders are "trying to find a message" and are "fearful" of the party's rank-and-file members.</p><p>One difference from prior funding fights, McCarthy argued, is that the country is more divided now and each side is blaming its opponents, so there isn't a clear narrative about who is responsible. </p><p>An Associated Press poll published last week found 82% of Democrats think congressional Republicans deserve a great deal of blame for the shutdown, while 73% of Republicans think congressional Democrats are to blame.</p>

<div class="article-title">Vance: Israel-Hamas ceasefire "going frankly better than I expected"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Vice President JD Vance and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner said Tuesday that the U.S.-brokered plan to end the war in Gaza is going better than they expected, despite the violence that erupted between Israel and Hamas in recent days. Vance, Kushner and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff are in Israel this week as they try to <span class="link">shore up the fragile ceasefire in Gaza</span>. </p><p>"Look, I think that we are one week into President Trump's historic peace plan in the Middle East, and things are going frankly better than I expected that they were," Vance told reporters as he began his press conference in Israel. </p><p>Vance insisted this is "not the end" of the peace plan, but rather, "exactly how this is going to have to happen when you have people who hate each other, who have been fighting against each other for a very long time."</p><p>"We are doing very well," he said. "We're in a very good place. We're going to have to keep working on it, but I think we have the team to do exactly that." </p><p>But Vance urged a "little bit of patience" as Israel waits for the return of all of the hostages' remains from Hamas. Vance said there are "difficulties" in securing all the bodies. </p>
<p>"Some of these hostages are buried under thousands of pounds of rubble," he said. "Some of the hostages nobody even knows where they are."</p><p>Two more bodies of hostages were transported back to Israel on Tuesday, according to the Israel Defense Forces. They were sent to the National Institute for Forensic Medicine to be identified, the Israeli military said.</p><p>The peace process has taken incremental steps forward despite the weekend violence, with Israel returning the remains of 15 Palestinians to Gaza on Tuesday following the handover by Hamas on Monday evening of the body of another deceased hostage. As part of the peace deal, a total of 165 Palestinians' bodies have now been returned to Gaza, many of them former detainees, while all 20 living Israeli hostages have been released by Hamas, along with the confirmed <span class="link">remains of 13 other deceased captives</span>.</p><p>The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu early Wednesday morning local time identified the remains of one of the returned hostages as Arie Zalmanovich, who was 85 when he died, according to the Israel Defense Forces. </p>
<p>The IDF early Wednesday morning also said the remains of one of the returned hostages had been identified as Sgt. Maj. (res.) Tamir Adar, 38. The IDF said he was killed during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack and his body was then taken to Gaza. </p><p>It was not immediately clear whether Zalmanovich and Adar were the two whose remains were released by Hamas on Tuesday.   </p><p>But despite those steps, the long-term viability of Mr. Trump's peace plan, which he's said will end nearly eight decades of fighting between Israel and the Palestinians, remains less certain.</p><p>"A lot of people are getting a little hysterical about different incursions one way or the other, but what we are seeing is that things are going in accordance," Kushner said Tuesday. "Both sides are transitioning from two years of very intense warfare to now a peacetime posture."</p><p>Kushner appeared optimistic, saying it's "amazing to think it's only been a week" since the peace agreement was signed. </p><p>Vance said the last week has given him "great optimism" the ceasefire is going to hold, adding that he'd come to Israel to "see how things were going" on the ground so he could report back to the president.</p><p>The U.S. and Israel need to be "a little bit flexible" on the issue of Hamas' disarmament, he said.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to do what the president of the United States has thus far refused to do, which is put an explicit deadline on it, because a lot of this stuff is difficult," he said of Hamas' time to disarm. "A lot of this stuff is unpredictable." </p><p>As he answered reporters' questions, the vice president emphasized that no American troops would be deployed in Gaza to implement the peace plan.</p><p>"There are not going to be American boots on the ground in Gaza," Vance said. "The president of the United States has made that very clear, all of our military leadership has made that very clear. What we can do is provide some useful coordination."</p><p>Before Vance left for Israel, he said bumps in the <span class="link">road to peace</span> were to be expected.</p><p>"There are going to be fits and starts," Vance told reporters. "Hamas is gonna fire on Israel, Israel's gonna have to respond, of course."</p><p>Hamas has denied responsibility for an alleged RPG attack that killed two Israeli soldiers over the weekend. Netanyahu said Monday that it was a Hamas attack, and that the Israeli military responded to the alleged ceasefire violation by dropping almost 169 tons of bombs in Gaza.</p><p>"One of our hands holds a weapon, the other hand is stretched out for peace," Netanyahu told lawmakers on Monday. "You make peace with the strong, not the weak. Today Israel is stronger than ever before."</p>
<p>The Israeli strikes killed at least 45 Palestinians, according to health officials in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p><p>President Trump warned Hamas on Monday against breaching the deal that took months to negotiate.</p><p>"They're gonna behave, they're gonna be nice," he said. "And if they're not, we're gonna go and eradicate them if we have to."</p><p><span class="link">Kushner and Witkoff</span> met Monday with Netanyahu, and the Israeli leader's office said Vance would also meet him this week. The vice president and second lady Usha Vance were greeted upon their arrival Tuesday by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Yechiel Leiter and Israel's Minister of Justice Yariv Levin.</p>
<p>Vance was scheduled to have a working lunch with Witkoff and Kushner on Tuesday before his meeting with Netanyahu.</p><h2>Ex-Israeli official casts doubt on prospects for Trump's peace plan</h2><p>Some Israelis remain skeptical that the Israeli prime minister is genuinely interested in a lasting peace. Among them is fierce Netanyahu critic Alon Pinkas, who served as an advisor to four Israeli foreign ministers. </p><p>He told CBS News that Netanyahu signed the peace deal brokered by Mr. Trump, but never really backed its core purpose, or Mr. Trump's stated goal of securing an enduring peace in the heart of the Middle East.</p>
<p>"This was an agreement he was bullied into," Pinkas said. "This is an agreement he signed under duress, and now he is developing a new scheme to manipulate Trump."</p><p>Pinkas credited Mr. Trump for doing<em> "</em>something that his predecessors were disinclined or hesitant to do, and that is exert real pressure" on Israel's leader. </p><p>"It worked, but it only worked for the first phase," Pinkas said, referring to the living Israeli hostages being released and the ceasefire coming into effect.</p><p>He said after the weekend's violence that the deal had been "ostensibly restored, but when Netanyahu says, 'I'm restoring the ceasefire,' it's only because there's a visit here of the vice president, JD Vance, and because the U.S. sent its envoy."</p><p>Pinkas said he was certain Israeli forces would resume operations in Gaza within days, noting they remained deployed in about half of the Palestinian territory.</p>
<p>"The hostages are no longer in danger because they were freed, and Hamas was not decisively destroyed, as Mr. Netanyahu promised and boasted and bragged for two years, so I see a serious incentive for Mr. Netanyahu to resume" an offensive against Hamas, Pinkas told CBS News. "Maybe not on a huge scale, given the agreement, but I do see ... a local skirmish that becomes a wider flare-up, that then deteriorates or escalates into a full Israeli military operation."</p><p>Hamas' top negotiator said Tuesday that the group remained committed to the ceasefire agreement. But President Trump's peace plan calls for the demilitarization of Gaza, and many analysts, including Pinkas, have doubts that Hamas will willingly hand over all its weapons.</p>
<p>"That's probably the biggest flaw in the agreement," said Pinkas. "The agreement in and of itself is a good agreement, but in order for an agreement like that to work, it requires good faith, good will, and trust. None of these ingredients exist. In fact, both sides have a vested interest in not progressing beyond the ceasefire."</p><p>"Hamas wants to lure Israel inside [Gaza] into a de-facto occupation, and mount an insurgency and show to the Palestinians that they are the real resistance. And Netanyahu wants to go in because he knows that if everything stops now and there is progress into the next phases, that almost inevitably means that he will be deemed as the guy who failed to defeat Hamas."</p><p>Pinkas said that while the past two years of war have left Hamas defeated militarily and degraded, "Hamas is not done. Hamas are there, and you see those pictures every day. You show them on CBS —   Hamas gangs walking around in battle fatigues, armed. That's not going to cut it politically for Mr. Netanyahu."</p>
<p>Speaking in a recent <span class="link">interview with CBS News' Tony Dokoupil</span>, Netanyahu said his government had agreed "to give peace a chance," but he noted that the conditions of Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan "are very clear — it's not only that we get the hostages out without getting our military out, but that we would subsequently have both demilitarization and disarmament. They're not the same thing. First Hamas has to give up its arms. And second, you want to make sure that there are no weapons factories inside Gaza. There's no smuggling of weapons into Gaza."</p><p>"We also agreed: Okay, let's get the first part done. Now let's give a chance to do the second part peacefully, which is my hope," the Israeli leader told CBS News.</p>

<div class="article-title">White House official says "no plans" for Trump-Putin meeting in "immediate future"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington</em> — There are "no plans" for a meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the "immediate future," a White House official said Tuesday.</p><p>The official told CBS News that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had a "productive call," and a future in-person meeting between Rubio and Lavrov is "not necessary." The State Department said that Rubio and Lavrov spoke on Monday.</p><p>"There are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future," the official said.</p><p>Mr. Trump told reporters later Tuesday that he didn't want to "have a wasted meeting." </p><p>"I don't want to have a waste of time here. I'll see what happens," Mr. Trump said, adding, "We'll see what happens. We haven't made a determination."</p>
<p>"We'll be notifying you over the next two days as to what we're doing. But a lot of things are happening. I think we're gonna get it solved," Mr. Trump said.</p><p>"I think Putin wants it to end, and I think Zelensky wants it to end, and I think it's going to end," the president added.</p><p>Mr. Trump spoke with Putin last week, after which he announced that he would <span class="link">meet the Russian president in Budapest, Hungary</span>, to discuss a possible end to Russia's war in Ukraine. The president did not say when the meeting would take place. He also previewed "high level" meetings between the U.S. and Russia, led by Rubio.</p><p>Mr. Trump called his discussion with Putin "very productive." It came one day before he <span class="link">met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</span> at the White House.</p>
<p>Rubio and Lavrov's conversation focused on "next steps" after Mr. Trump and Putin's discussion last week, according to State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott. </p><p>"The Secretary emphasized the importance of upcoming engagements as an opportunity for Moscow and Washington to collaborate on advancing a durable resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war, in line with President Trump's vision," Pigott said.</p><p>But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov indicated Tuesday that a meeting may be a long way off.</p><p>"Preparation is needed, serious preparation," he told reporters, according to the Associated Press.</p><p>Mr. Trump and Putin <span class="link">met in Anchorage, Alaska</span>, in August for discussions about Russia's war in Ukraine, though the summit yielded no tangible results. Instead, Moscow has not let up on its military aggression, continuing to <span class="link">launch drone and missile strikes</span> across Ukraine.</p><p>The president has pushed for a ceasefire in Ukraine, and on Sunday, he called for an immediate halt in the war that would see Russia maintaining control of territory it invaded in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.</p><p>"Let it be cut the way it is. It's cut up right now. I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia. You leave it the way it is right now," Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One, apparently referring to the Donbas region. "They can negotiate something later on down the line. But I said cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people."</p>
<p>Mr. Trump on Tuesday appeared to reiterate this idea, saying, "I said, go to the line. Go to the line of battle, the battlefield lines. And you pull back and you go home, and everybody take some time off, because you got two countries that are killing each other. Two countries are losing 5,000 to 7,000 soldiers a week."</p><p>But the president has at times expressed conflicting views on the war in Ukraine, and specifically over Russia's occupation of parts of eastern Ukraine, including territories it captured in 2014 and during the current conflict, which began in February 2022.</p><p>Mr. Trump <span class="link">said last month</span> Ukraine was in a "position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form."</p><p>"With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option. Why not?" he wrote on social media after meeting with Zelenskyy on the <span class="link">sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly</span>.</p><p>The president called Russia's military a "paper tiger."</p><p>Zelenskyy, however, has rejected the prospect of ceding any Russian-occupied ground. The Ukrainian leader said he is urging Europe to put "the right kind of pressure" on Russia. He and European leaders said in a joint statement Tuesday that they support Mr. Trump's call for an immediate stop in fighting and said the "current line of contact should be the starting point for negotiations."</p><p>But they also accused Russia of employing "stalling tactics" that undermine any suggestion it is seeking peace.</p>
<p>"We can all see that Putin continues to choose violence and destruction," the European leaders said.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Guidance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) clarifies that a <span class="link">$100,000 fee</span> imposed in September to obtain H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers applies only to new applicants who are living abroad.</p><p>In a notice posted on the agency's website late Monday, USCIS explains what types of visa applicants must pay the new six-figure fee and who is exempt. Applications for H-1B visas filed on or after Sept. 21 for workers outside the U.S. and who are not current H-1B visa holders are subject to the $100,000 charge, USCIS said. </p><p>The fee also applies if a petition filed on or after Sept. 21 "requests consular notification, port of entry notification or pre-flight inspection for an alien in the United States."</p><p>The $100,000 payment must be paid prior to applying for an H-1B visa, according to USCIS.</p><p>Importantly for employers, the fee does not apply when a visa applicant files to move from one type of visa to another, such as from an F-1 visa for non-U.S. students to H-1B status.</p>
<p>The White House had previously said the fee would apply to all new H-1B visa applicants, with exemptions for some specialized workers who do not "pose a threat to the security or welfare" of the U.S.</p><p>In announcing the new H-1B policy on Sept. 19, President Trump said the new fee was necessary "to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers." He also said some employers take advantage of the visa program to undercut U.S. workers' wages by hiring lower-paid foreign workers.</p><p>Earlier this month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce <span class="link">sued the Trump administration</span> over the foreign worker visa fee, calling it unlawful. It was the second complaint to be filed challenging the fee, with a coalition of health care groups and labor unions also challenging the policy's legality in a lawsuit filed in October.  </p>

<div class="article-title">90% of Americans plan to skip the No. 1 piece of Social Security advice</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore one of the most common pieces of financial advice about Social Security: waiting until age 70 to claim benefits, which ensures higher monthly payments, according to a new study from investment firm Schroders.</p><p>Social Security allows employees to claim their benefits as soon as they turn 62, years before the so-called "full retirement age," which now stands at 67. But claiming Social Security early has a tradeoff—it lowers your monthly payment by about 30%, with those lower benefits locked in for the rest of your life. </p><p>By contrast, delaying Social Security until age 70 results in a roughly 30% higher monthly payment than if you claimed benefits at age 67 — also locked in as long you're collecting benefits. As a result, financial experts often recommend that seniors hold off as long as they can, with one study finding that filing early for benefits can <span class="link">cost $182,000</span> in foregone payments. </p><p>The Schroders survey suggests that many Americans who haven't yet retired aren't buying that advice. In the survey of 1,500 adults, most respondents said they understand the trade-offs of claiming early, but only 10% plan to wait until age 70, while 44% expect to file for benefits before they reach full retirement age.</p><h2>"Not an oversight"</h2><p>The disconnect illustrates the financial reality facing most workers, Deb Boyden, head of U.S. defined contribution at Schroders, told CBS News.</p>
<p>"The decision to sacrifice extra Social Security income is not an oversight for most Americans," she said. "According to our research, 70% of Americans are aware that waiting longer to claim Social Security leads to higher payments, and yet so few are willing to hold off."</p><p>Many retirees are facing a shortfall in their own retirement savings, a financial gap that's been well documented as a growing share of Americans <span class="link">live paycheck to paycheck</span>. Many workers "need the income generated by Social Security to meet their expenses immediately upon retiring," Boyden noted.</p><p>Another new study, released Tuesday by the Allianz Center for the Future of Retirement, finds that a majority of Americans say they don't know much about Social Security or how it will fit into their retirement plan. And about 1 in 5 believe Social Security will provide all the retirement income they need, even though it generally replaces only 40% of a worker's wages when they retire, the study found.</p><p>There's another reason why many Americans plan on claiming their Social Security benefits before reaching full retirement age, she added. That's due to concerns about the future of Social Security, which is fueling concerns that "the money may not be there if they wait," Boyden said. </p>
<p>Social Security is indeed <span class="link">facing a financial crunch</span>, with an aging U.S. population resulting in its payments now outpacing contributions from workers. Without changes to the program, that will result in its trust funds <span class="link">becoming insolvent</span> by 2034, according to the most recent calculation from the Social Security Board of Trustees. </p><p>Yet many people wrongly believe that means Social Security will halt payments if the trust funds become insolvent. Payments would continue in such an event, but benefits would be reduced by about 20% — a potentially major financial hit to the program's more than 70 million beneficiaries. </p><p>Still, there are ways lawmakers can shore up the program, such as by raising the income cap on Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100, according to experts. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.</p><p>In the meantime, non-retired Americans told Schroders they believe they need $5,032 in monthly income to retire comfortably. But today's retirees on average generate about $3,250 in monthly retirement income, Boyden said, adding that the gap signals the need to help workers plan better for retirement. </p><p>A recent analysis from Goldman Sachs found three-quarters of younger working Americans say they're <span class="link">struggling to save</span> for retirement because basic expenses such as housing are eating up a bigger share of their income compared with prior generations.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>OpenAI said Tuesday it is launching an artificial intelligence-powered website browser, heightening the company's competition with Google, the Alphabet-owned unit that has long dominated online search. </p><p>The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, is for now only available on Apple laptops that run the company's Mac operating system. Access will soon expand to Apple's iOS, Microsoft Windows and Google's Android platforms, OpenAI said.</p><p>In the company's launch video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.</p><p>"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then," he said.</p><h2>What the Atlas browser can do</h2><p>Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content. </p>
<p>But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an "Ask ChatGPT" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser. </p><p>"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet," said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser. </p><p>The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email. </p><p>"It's using the internet for you," Altman said.</p>
<p>Atlas also has an "agent mode" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.</p><p>OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology.</p>

<div class="article-title">Tariffs are starting to bite consumers and businesses, economists say</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Trump administration tariffs imposed this year on dozens of nations and a range of industries are fueling inflation, especially for goods that are widely imported into the U.S., a recent analysis shows. </p><p>Product categories seeing some of the biggest price hikes due to tariffs include <span class="link">furniture</span>, car parts, electronics and musical instruments, according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The findings are based on research models estimating tariff-related price hikes and drawing on Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, a widely used gauge of inflation.</p><p>Importers bear the cost of tariffs, typically passing at least some of the added expenses to consumers, economic research shows. </p><p>The St. Louis Fed researchers found that companies passed 35% of tariff costs onto consumers from May through July. Other research from Goldman Sachs suggests that businesses could eventually pass on as much as <span class="link">55% of added tariff</span> costs to consumers. Companies would swallow 22% of the extra costs, while foreign exporters would absorb 18% of the expenses, economists with the investment bank found. </p><h2>How much could inflation rise?</h2><p>Businesses are expected to continue experimenting with pricing based on how tariffs affect their own costs, according to Max Dvorkin, an economist and one of the authors the St. Louis Fed study. </p>
<p>"Even if you don't change tariffs anymore, the dynamics of prices will continue to evolve and affect consumers over the next few months," he said. </p><p>The regional Fed bank found that tariffs account for a sizable share of recent inflation. Between June through August, the tariffs imposed by President Trump added 0.5 percentage points to the headline PCE rate, which averaged 2.85% during that period, according to the findings. The levies added 0.4 percentage points to core PCE, which excludes volatile energy and food prices and which hovered around 2.9% during that three-month period, the study found. </p><p>"Tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices," the economists conclude. </p><p>As of August, the Consumer Price Index <span class="link">was up 2.9%</span> from a year ago after, remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. Inflation as measured by the index had fallen in April to a low of 2.3%, but has flared during the second half of the year. The Labor Department is expected to release CPI data for September, which has been delayed by the <span class="link">government shutdown</span>, on Friday.</p><p>The St. Louis Fed study notes that tariffs haven't driven up consumer prices as sharply as some experts had predicted. That's chiefly because many businesses are waiting to see where tariff rates settle before they adjust their prices, according to the research. </p>
<p>"We believe the passthrough of tariff increases by U.S. businesses to consumers remains in the early stages, delayed by stop-and-go announcements, pauses and drawn-out implementation," anaysts with the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a report on Tuesday. </p><p>The White House did not respond to CBS News' request for comment. President Trump has defended his administration's trade policy, saying that it will benefit the country's manufacturing sector and boost job growth over the long-term.</p><p>Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs will cost businesses in the U.S. an additional $1.2 trillion this year, with consumers shouldering most of those costs, according to S&amp;P Global analysts who reviewed data from 9,000 companies. </p><p>Companies have passed on roughly two-thirds of those tariff costs — $592 billion — to consumers in the form of higher prices, S&amp;P said. The levies have reduced corporate earnings by a total of $315 billion.</p>

<div class="article-title">States warn SNAP benefits may stop in November if shutdown continues</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.</p><p>"Starting October 16, SNAP  [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the <span class="link">federal government shutdown</span> ends and funds are released to PA," reads a notice from the Pennsylvania state website.</p><p>New Jersey, <span class="link">Maryland</span>, New York and Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.</p><p>The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be "insufficient funds" to pay full November SNAP benefits.</p><p>Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program. Advocates, meanwhile, have warned the effects could be devastating.</p>
<p>"These are, for the most part, working individuals who still are living paycheck to paycheck," said Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research &amp; Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger. </p><h2>How SNAP benefits are normally administered</h2><p>Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.</p><p>While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a "delicate partnership of public and private entities."</p><p>To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards. </p>
<p>"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time," Plata-Nino explained. "They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe."</p><p>The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors "until further notice." The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.</p><p>"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one," Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident and SNAP recipient, told CBS News.</p><h2>Contingency funding</h2><p>One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.</p><p>After Democrats and Republicans <span class="link">failed to come to an agreement</span> to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown. </p><p>"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year," the plan states. </p><p>However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on whether that option is under consideration. </p>
<p>During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, Plata-Nino said.</p><p>"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ..." Plata-Nino said. "They have the money, so it really is a policy choice."</p><p>It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.</p><p>Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump 's pick to lead a federal watchdog agency withdrew from consideration Tuesday evening, after his offensive text messages were made public and GOP senators revolted.</p> <p>Paul Ingrassia, who was nominated to lead the Office of Special Counsel, had been scheduled to have his confirmation hearing this week.</p> <p>On Monday, however, Politico reported on a text chat that showed him saying the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be "tossed into the seventh circle of hell." Ingrassia also described himself in the chat as having "a Nazi streak" at times.</p> <p>After the texts came to light, several Republican senators said they would not support his nomination. They included some of the most conservative and stalwart Trump allies in the Senate.</p>
<p>"I will be withdrawing myself from Thursday's HSGAC hearing to lead the Office of Special Counsel because unfortunately I do not have enough Republican votes at this time," Ingrassia posted in an online message. "I appreciate the overwhelming support that I have received throughout the process and will continue to serve President Trump and the administration to Make America Great Again!" HSGAC is the Senate Committee on Homeland Security &amp; Governmental Affairs.</p>
<p>Asked for comment on Ingrassia withdrawing his name from consideration, the White House said simply, "He is no longer the nominee." But Ingrassia's post came after Senate Majority Leader John Thune had said he hoped the White House would withdraw Ingrassia's nomination and several GOP senators said they would not support him.</p> <p>"I'm a no," said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who sits on the committee that would've taken up Ingrassia's nomination. "It never should have got this far."</p> <p>Republicans have been able to muscle through the vast majority of Trump's nominees in roll call votes despite stiff Democratic opposition. But there have been sporadic instances when Republicans have pushed back, generally behind the scenes, showing there are limits to their support.</p> <p>Most notably, Matt Gaetz withdrew as Trump's first choice for attorney general soon after being tabbed for the job. In May, Trump pulled his nomination of Ed Martin Jr. to be the top federal prosecutor for the nation's capital, bowing to bipartisan concerns about the conservative activist's modest legal experience and support for Jan. 6 rioters.</p>
<p>Last month, the White House announced it would be withdrawing the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Antoni was supposed to succeed a BLS director who was fired following a disappointing jobs report.</p> <p>But Democrats weren't satisfied with Ingrassia's withdrawal, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., calling on the president to fire him from his current position as a White House liaison for the Department of Homeland Security.</p> <p>"This isn't anywhere near enough," Schumer said on social media.</p> <p>According to texts viewed by Politico, Ingrassia told those in the chat that "MLK Jr. was the 1960s George Floyd and his 'holiday' should be ended and tossed into the seventh circle of hell where it belongs."</p> <p>Politico spoke to Ingrassia's lawyer, who said the text messages might have been manipulated or were missing context. The lawyer did not confirm the texts were authentic.</p> <p>The Office of Special Counsel is an investigative and prosecutorial office that works to protect government employees and whistleblowers from retaliation for reporting wrongdoing. It's also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers.</p> <p>In May, Trump described Ingrassia in a social media post as a "highly respected attorney, writer and Constitutional Scholar."</p>

<div class="article-title">Pardoned Capitol rioter arrested for allegedly threatening to kill Hakeem Jeffries</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A man who was pardoned by President Trump after storming the U.S. Capitol in 2021 has been arrested on a charge that he threatened to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.</p> <p>New York State Police say Christopher Moynihan was arrested after they were advised by the FBI that he had made "threats to kill a member of Congress." Court documents show his arrest came after he allegedly texted that he planned to kill Jeffries, the top Democrat in the House.  </p> <p>Court records show that on or about October 17, Moynihan allegedly sent texts in which he threatened Jeffries' life, writing "I will kill him for the future."</p>
<p>"Hakeem Jeffries makes a speech in a few days in NYC I cannot allow this terrorist to live," one message reads, according to the criminal complaint. "Even if I am hated he must be eliminated," reads another.</p> <p>Moynihan, 34, was arraigned in local court in Clinton, N.Y. He was remanded to the Dutchess County Justice and Transition Center "in lieu of $10,000 cash bail, a $30,000 bond, or an $80,000 partially secured bond." He is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday. </p> <p>He faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat.</p> <p>In a statement Tuesday, Jeffries noted Moynihan was pardoned on Trump's first day in office.</p>
<p>"Since the blanket pardon that occurred earlier this year, many of the criminals released have committed additional crimes throughout the country," he said. "Unfortunately, our brave men and women in law enforcement are being forced to spend their time keeping our communities safe from these violent individuals who should never have been pardoned."</p> <p>Moynihan was sentenced in 2023 to 21 months incarceration, 36 months supervised release. He received a full pardon, along with more than 1,500 other defendants who were charged with crimes related to the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. </p> <p>On that day, Moynihan can be heard on a video captured inside the Senate floor saying, "There's got to be something we can use against these f***ing scumbags.''"</p>
<p>While many people had no record prior to committing crimes on Jan. 6, NPR identified dozens of defendants with prior convictions for crimes including rape, sexual abuse of a minor, domestic violence, manslaughter, production of child sexual abuse material and drug trafficking. That includes Matthew Huttle, who was shot and killed by law enforcement during a traffic stop in Indiana days after receiving a pardon.</p> <p>Moynihan's arrest comes amid rising threats to lawmakers. The Capitol Police told NPR in a statement in September that its agents were on track to work through roughly 14,000 threat assessment cases by the end of the year, a dramatic spike from case workloads in previous years.</p> <p><em>NPR's Sam Gringlas contributed to this report.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Reversing peanut advice prevented tens of thousands of allergy cases, researchers say</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>For years, parents were told not to expose their babies to peanuts, to prevent a potentially dangerous allergy. But 10 years ago, a landmark study found the opposite to be true, stating that if babies consume peanut products at an early age, they were far less likely to become allergic to them.</p> <p>Health experts quickly took notice — and the resulting reversal in pediatric guidance has helped to push peanuts out of the No. 1 spot as the cause of food allergy for children under 3 in the U.S., according to a new study published in the peer-reviewed journal <em>Pediatrics</em>.</p>
<p>"Early allergen introduction works," Dr. David Hill, who led the study, tells NPR. "For the first time in recent history, it seems like we're starting to put a brake pedal on the epidemic of food allergy in this country."</p>
<p>Growing concerns over food allergies have reshaped parts of Americans' diet, from schools and camps banning peanut butter in sandwiches to airlines nixing once-ubiquitous bags of salted nuts. In 2015, <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em> referenced a quadrupling of peanut allergy's prevalence in U.S. children, citing growth from 0.4% in 1997 to more than 2% in 2010.</p> <p>But when U.S. health guidance changed in 2015 and 2017, so did that trend, according to Hill, a pediatric allergist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who's also an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania.</p> <p>"There was a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence," Hill says, "and a 36% reduction in any food allergy prevalence."</p> <p>He estimates that the changed guidelines have prevented peanut allergies in at least 40,000 children in the last decade.</p> <p>The tipping point in peanut allergy prevention dates to 2015, when research was published that aimed to solve a puzzle: Why was peanut allergy 10 times higher among Jewish children in the U.K. than among Israeli children with similar ancestry? Researchers noted that while British and U.S. parents kept their babies away from peanut products, many Israeli parents routinely fed their infants a puffy peanut snack called Bamba.</p>
<p>The revised recommendations, including in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, calls for introducing infants deemed at high risk for peanut allergy to foods containing peanuts as early as 4 to 6 months, in line with advice published in 2017 by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p> <p>Hill and his colleagues looked at the rate of food allergy in young children before and after the revised guidelines for peanuts and other allergens were published. They did that by analyzing the health data of more than 120,000 children in the U.S. using records from dozens of different pediatric practices.</p>
<p>Dr. Corinne Keet, a professor of pediatrics at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who works in the epidemiology of food allergy, says she finds the study interesting, even if she's cautious about reading too much into it. She wasn't involved in the research.</p> <p>"I'm a little bit surprised by these findings because I might have expected that we might have more diagnoses just because people were thinking about allergies more" in the past decade, she says.</p> <p>Part of the reason for her caution, Keet says, is that her own research has found families haven't been fully implementing the new guidelines, in many cases due to fear that exposing an infant to peanut products might also endanger a sibling or parent who's allergic.</p> <p>Keet also says it's simply difficult to conduct a high-quality study about food allergy prevalence. She notes that the influential 2015 study, called LEAP (Learning Early about Peanut Allergy), produced definitive results by conducting a large clinical trial following hundreds of young kids over time.</p> <p>Hill and his colleagues acknowledge that their study has limitations, such as relying on diagnostic codes — which aren't necessarily equivalent to actual allergy rates. Their data also does not include information about children's eating habits.</p> <p>Still, he sees the study as another positive sign that a strategic shift is helping children. The benefits are far-reaching, he adds, because many peanut allergies are a lifetime condition.</p> <p>"It's highly persistent," Hill says. "Only about 10% of kids who develop a peanut allergy will outgrow that peanut allergy."</p>

<div class="article-title">Israel takes steps to shut down international aid groups in Gaza and the West Bank</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>AMMAN, Jordan — Israel, having banned the United Nations aid agency for Palestinian refugees from sending aid and staff to Gaza, is now taking unprecedented steps to de-register major nongovernmental aid groups for ideological reasons, according to several officials of<strong> </strong>humanitarian organizations.</p> <p>They say the new rules threaten the ability of some of the biggest international nongovernmental organizations — known as INGOs — to send in aid or staff to both Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p>
<p>"INGOs are in limbo — most who have submitted have either been not accepted or rejected," an official with an aid organization that is aware of the situation said of the application process required for nongovernmental aid organizations operating in Gaza and the West Bank. The official spoke on the condition that NPR not name their employer and not give their name because they are not authorized to speak publicly.</p> <p>The ceasefire agreement in the Gaza war brokered this month by President Trump committed Israel to a surge in aid into Gaza, where food security experts declared famine in parts of the territory. But Israel continues to severely restrict crossings open for aid shipments and who can send aid through them. Of seven Israeli border crossings with Gaza, only two are currently open. Of those that are open, the U.N. and nongovernmental aid groups say many requests to enter Gaza are routinely rejected, without explanation.</p>
<p>The Israeli military has claimed, without providing evidence, that its aid restrictions are needed for security.</p> <p>Israel this fall began requiring that all international aid groups re-register under new criteria, including approval by a committee which includes representatives from Israel's Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism.</p>
<p>Reasons for delisting aid groups include supporting "terrorist groups and activities in accordance with Israel law" and "inciting racism," according to COGAT, the Israeli military's arm that is part of NGO approval process. Aid organizations say the reasoning appears to be used to refer to a wide variety of comments the Israeli government classifies as antisemitic. Israel has in the past accused some aid groups and medical providers of being terrorist organizations.</p> <p>Israel had also demanded that organizations provide personnel details for all local and international staff, a measure rejected by most major aid groups as potentially putting staff in danger.</p> <p>The Norwegian Refugee Council, registered in Gaza since 2009, is one of the major aid groups unable to send in supplies or staff while its application is being considered.</p> <p>"We quickly realized that the intent behind the process wasn't to facilitate the re-registration of humanitarian INGOs but rather to find a way to re-register us and to remove our ability to operate," says Ivan Karakashian, communications manager for the NRC in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>He says there were no clear guidelines as to what delegitimizing Israel included. Any de-registered organizations would have to cease operations in both Gaza and the Israeli occupied West Bank within 60 days, according to aid officials familiar with the criteria.</p> <p>The Israeli military arm responsible for borders and coordination with INGO operations did not respond to NPR's requests for comment on reasons for de-registering or delaying registration of some organizations.</p> <p>Many of those aid groups waiting to be re-registered have had hundreds of trucks waiting for months in Egypt and Jordan intended for Gaza.</p>
<p>Humanitarian officials said at least one major U.S.-based NGO has already been de-registered and is now in the appeal process. The organization in question declined to discuss the issue with NPR.</p> <p>Another U.S.-based aid group, Mercy Corps, said following the ceasefire agreement, it had submitted a request to send in aid but it was denied by Israeli authorities because the organization was in the process of re-registering.</p>
<p>Humanitarian officials said Israel has approved a dozen NGOs that do not coordinate within traditional U.N.-led structures and are either ideologically driven or have little experience in humanitarian aid or both. They include one U.S. aid group that partnered with the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — a militarized aid response in which almost all other aid groups refused to participate.</p> <p>COGAT did not respond to a request for comment on new aid organizations given registration.</p> <p>At the same time, Israel continues to ban the U.N. agency for providing aid to Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, from sending in aid or staff to Gaza. Israel accused UNRWA, without evidence, of employing hundreds of Hamas members, including some involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel. It has sought since the start of the Gaza war to replace the U.N. aid system that has provided humanitarian assistance there for decades.</p>
<p>UNRWA, with 12,000 local staff, was the biggest humanitarian organization in Gaza, running shelters, mobile medical clinics, water and sanitation projects and schools.</p> <p>"The warehouses in Jordan and Egypt are full of food that can feed the entire population of Gaza for three months and we need to bring that in," says Tamara Alrifai, UNRWA's director of external relations. The supplies also include medicine, tents, blankets and hygiene products.</p> <p>Israeli airstrikes have damaged or destroyed more than 90% of homes in Gaza and most of the civilian infrastructure, according to U.N. figures.</p>
<p>The United States, which had been UNRWA's biggest donor, stopped its funding last year, which Alrifai says led to a loss of about one-quarter of UNRWA's total income. Alrifai says while European and other countries have increased their contributions, it does not fill the funding gap. The European Union's top humanitarian aid official said after the Israeli accusations against UNRWA he saw no evidence from Israel backing them.</p> <p>Alrifai says UNRWA was trying to start discussions with the U.S. through other countries about renewing the funding.</p> <p>"We have not had direct talks but we have passed on messages through other governments who are close to Gaza and close to the U.S." she says.</p> <p><em>Aya Batrawy contributed reporting from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">5 things to know about Sanae Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Japan's first-ever female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, is an ultraconservative with a traditional view of gender roles and a penchant for heavy metal music.</p> <p>Japan's parliament elected Takaichi on Tuesday, several weeks after she was chosen to lead the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has spent much of the last seven decades in power. The LDP is seen as shifting further to the right: It was only able to elect Takaichi by forming an alliance with a right-wing populist party, after losing its longtime coalition partner earlier this month.</p> <p>Takaichi, 64, is "one of the most conservative people in Japan's conservative LDP," explains Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies in Japan.</p>
<p>She has advocated for tougher immigration restrictions and embraced hawkish policies on China. She has drawn comparisons to the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for whom she has frequently expressed her admiration and often wears blue suits in tribute.</p> <p>But she also played drums in a band in college, cites Deep Purple and Iron Maiden as some of her favorite bands, once belted a rock anthem on national TV and appears to maintain a strong affinity for motorcycles and cars.</p> <p>"Those are part of the character that is promoted by her, that [she is] more than just the strong Iron Lady, but also somebody who can have some fun," Hall says.</p> <p>Here's what else to know about Japan's new leader.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">1. She isn't from a political family</h3> <p>Takaichi was born and raised in the central Japanese prefecture of Nara. Her dad worked for an automotive firm, while her mom worked for the local police department.</p> <p>"Unlike most or many of the politicians in her party who became prime ministers, she came from rather modest means," Hall says. "But she did study very hard when she was young, and she passed the entrance exams for some very elite private universities in Japan."</p>
<p>But he said Takaichi's parents refused to pay for her tuition to an elite university, preferring that she attend a two-year college to save money and live closer to home. She ended up attending Kobe University, a prestigious national university, paying her own way through part-time jobs and making the six-hour round-trip commute from her parents' house.</p> <p>In 1987, Takaichi moved to the U.S. to work as a congressional fellow in the office of Rep. Pat Schroeder, a Democrat from Colorado — despite her own conservative leanings, Hall notes. After returning to Japan, she was able to market herself as an expert in international politics and secure a job as a television presenter.</p> <p>"And from there, she segued away from being a TV personality into a politician, which is a common path in Japan," Hall says. "If you're famous on TV, you have a pretty good chance of winning elections."</p> <h3 class="edTag">2. She's spent decades in politics </h3> <p>Takaichi was first elected to parliament in 1993, representing her hometown of Nara as an independent.</p> <p>She joined the LDP three years later and went on to serve in a number of key government positions, including minister of economic security.</p> <p>Notably, she served as the minister of international communications — which is responsible for telecommunications policy and broadcast media regulations — under the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, from 2014 to 2017 and again from 2019 to 2020.</p>
<p>"She served in that, I think, longer than any other politician has ever served, because the Abe administration was a very long administration and he valued her competency," Hall says.</p> <p>Abe was Japan's longest-serving prime minister, holding office from 2006 to 2007 and 2012 to 2020, before his assassination in 2022. He was known for his efforts to revitalize Japan's economy — nicknamed "Abenomics" — and rebuild its role on the global stage.</p> <p>Takaichi "definitely depicts herself as the successor to Abe's conservative legacy," Hall says, noting that she did get his endorsement in the party's 2021 leadership election.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure how close friends they were, but they definitely were on the same page ideologically when it came to issues like China and the revisionist view of World War II that many of the ultra-conservatives in Japan have," he said.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">3. Her views have caused controversy</h3> <p>Takaichi subscribes to modern monetary theory, "which says that you can engage in deficit spending on important things like defense and other parts of the budget," Hall says.</p> <p>While she is not as traditionally fiscally conservative as others in her party, he says, she is extremely conservative on social issues. For instance, she wants to create programs to promote having children and doesn't think women should be allowed to keep their maiden names after marriage (even though she has used hers in professional and public life).</p>
<p>She also has what Hall describes as hardline views on Japan's WWII history. In remarks over the years, she has downplayed Japan's aggression during the war and criticized the war crimes trials that the Allies held afterward to convict Japan's wartime leaders.</p> <p>Takaichi is also known to regularly visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, where the convicted war criminals are buried and glorified. But she noticeably abstained from visiting during last week's autumn festival, sending a ritual offering instead.</p> <p>Takaichi has also courted controversy with her disdain for immigrants and even tourists, a rapidly growing industry in Japan. While campaigning, she cited unconfirmed reports of tourists kicking sacred deer in Nara Park, part of a larger criticism of tourism that many saw as xenophobic.</p> <p>"It also ties into a general dislike of foreign people and also immigrants who live in the country," Hall says.</p> <p>She has advocated for an anti-espionage law, suggesting that Chinese residents of Japan could be potential spies for China's government. During her campaign, she called for restrictions on non-Japanese people buying property in Japan and a crackdown on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>"People who are very anti-immigration are sort of smiling on her becoming prime minister, expecting that she will do something about it," Hall says, adding he thinks that is unlikely because of pressure from Japanese businesses who rely on immigration in the face of significant labor shortages.</p> <h3 class="edTag">4. She's not necessarily a feminist </h3> <p>Takaichi holds a notable place in the history books as the first female prime minister of a country where women only held about 10% of seats in parliament as of 2024.</p> <p>Japan, the world's fourth largest economy, ranked 118th out of 148 countries in terms of gender equality — the lowest of any Group of Seven nation — according to the World Economic Forum (WEF)'s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report.</p> <p>However, Takaichi appears unlikely to prioritize issues of gender equality. She has long advocated for traditional gender roles, opposes same-sex marriage and supports male-only succession to the Japanese throne.</p>
<p>"This is not going to be a period when women's equality or other gender issues are aggressively advanced," Hall says. "But there is, I guess, some benefit to having a woman as the leader of your country, to show … young women that in the future they could become prime minister, too."</p> <p>Takaichi has spoken about women's rights, specifically advocating for the expansion of hospital services for women's health and opening up about her own struggles with menopause symptoms.</p> <p>Takaichi has also spoken about her struggles to conceive; She has no biological children, but is a stepmother to three kids — and grandmother to four — from her husband's previous marriage. (She is married to former member of parliament and fellow LDP member Taku Yamamoto, who legally took her last name, a relative rarity in Japan.)</p> <p>Takaichi had promised on the campaign trail to increase the number of women in her cabinet to "Nordic levels," or closer to 50%. But in the hours after taking office, she appointed only two.</p>
<p>Hall says Takaichi has had to be more conservative than her male colleagues in order to take the helm of the party. While she and her role model Margaret Thatcher differ in their approaches to fiscal policy, he says both are conservative, hawkish and "do not want to be seen as weak."</p>
<p>"She maybe, in a way, has modeled her rise on Margaret Thatcher by being this very strong figure, despite coming [up] in a party of very conservative men who generally do not promote women to the highest positions," he adds.</p> <h3 class="edTag">5. She appears friendly toward Trump</h3> <p>Takaichi has indicated a friendliness toward President Trump, who called her "a highly respected person of great wisdom and strength" in a social media post earlier this month congratulating her on her rise to party leadership and her expected ascension to prime minister.</p> <p>She responded with a post of her own, writing in both English and Japanese that she is "truly hoping to work together with President Trump to make our alliance even stronger &amp; more prosperous, and to advance a Free and Open Indo-Pacific."</p>
<p>Hall says Trump likely has a good first impression of Takaichi already, because of her reputation as an "anti-immigration, hard-line conservative who is a respecter of his late friend Shinzo Abe."</p> <p>Abe was one of the first foreign leaders to cultivate a relationship with Trump during his first term. The two became friends as they bonded over wagyu beef burgers, sumo wrestling and golf.</p> <p>Trump is expected to meet Takaichi on a visit to Japan later this month. Hall predicts she will follow the same playbook as her predecessors:</p> <p>"You be as nice as possible to the president, you show him the maximum respect, you do not have public disagreements with him," he says. "And when you do disagree over policy, you do it in a very subtle way that doesn't seem like you're telling the president he's wrong."</p>

<div class="article-title">Books about race and gender to be returned to school libraries on some military bases</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A federal judge ordered the Department of Defense Monday to return books about gender and race back to five school libraries on military bases.</p> <p>In April, 12 students at schools on military bases in Virginia, Kentucky, Italy and Japan claimed their First Amendment rights had been violated when nearly 600 books were removed from the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools they attend. The students are the children of active duty service members ranging from pre-K to 11th grade.</p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Kentucky, and the ACLU of Virginia filed a motion on behalf of the families requesting the return of "all books and curriculum already quarantined or removed based on potential violation of the Executive Orders."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, President Trump issued executive orders demanding federal agencies remove and prohibit any materials that promote "gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology."</p> <p>In January, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued the memoranda "Restoring America's Fighting Force," which prohibited "instruction on Critical Race Theory (CRT), DEI, or gender ideology," and "Identity Months Dead at DoD," which barred using official resources for celebrations such as Black History Month, Women's History Month and Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.</p> <p>According to the plaintiffs, DoDEA officials sent emails directing teachers to remove books and cancel lesson plans and events that would be in violation of Trump's executive orders and Hegseth's guidance.</p> <p>Books removed from school libraries at military bases covered such topics as sexual identity, racism and LGBTQ pride. You can see a list of the books here.</p> <p>Two elementary schools cancelled Black History Month events, teachers at a middle school were told to remove posters of education activist Malala Yousafzai and painter Frida Kahlo and another school cancelled Holocaust Remembrance Day.</p> <p>According to the motion filed by the ACLU, the students claimed that when they protested the school's actions, they were punished and became "increasingly afraid to discuss race and gender in their classrooms, because they fear being silenced by teachers fearful of violating the EOs and DoDEA guidance."</p>
<p>In her decision, U.S. District Court Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles sided with the students and their families, writing that "the removals were not rooted in pedagogical concerns" but rather there was "improper partisan motivation underlying [defendants'] actions." Giles wrote that DOD officials must "immediately restore the books and curricular materials that have been removed."</p> <p>The Department of Defense and the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) have not yet responded to NPR's request for comment.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Tech CEOs say the era of 'code by AI' is here. Some software engineers are skeptical</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Tech CEOs are making ambitious claims about AI's coding capabilities. In March, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said "we'll be there in three to six months — where AI is writing 90% of the code." Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg predicted in April that for one project "in the next year probably … maybe half the development is going to be done by AI." Executives of Amazon, Google and Microsoft have also highlighted large language models' (LLMs') abilities to generate code.</p> <p>AI tools have changed how coding works for some developers and there are now fewer of the most junior software engineers. But despite the dramatic rhetoric, AI in software engineering might not mean a new age of automation.</p>
<p>After months of sitting on the sidelines, software engineer Colton Voege finally tried out AI tools for his work. He remembered watching a podcast where leaders of tech startup incubator Y Combinator, which helped Voege launch a company, touted AI's "incredible productivity."</p> <p>"It kind of confirmed what I already felt about it, in that it's really good at shortcutting certain things," Voege said. "[AI] is great for writing little tools that you'll use once and then throw away." But he hasn't seen evidence of long-term boosts to his efficiency.</p> <p>Interviews show that many software engineers, though not all, share Voege's experience. Some tell stories of untangling AI-generated code their colleagues have handed them, others talk about the pressure to make up work that purports to use AI to make higher-ups happy.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Yes, AI can write code ... but still needs people</h3> <p>In an interview with NPR, Boris Cherny, head of Anthropic's Claude Code unit, said "most code is written by Claude Code," but declined to provide a percentage. "We're still working on the science to make sure we can give a really precise number."</p> <p>Cherny was also clear that no matter how much AI is actually used, "Every line of code should be reviewed by an engineer."</p>
<p>He said this includes code generated by what Anthropic called "agents." Agents are a component of AI tools that have the ability to test and rewrite code without human intervention. The function, hailed as much more autonomous than previous tools, was first introduced by Claude Code and was celebrated<strong> </strong>by many in the industry as a pathway to automation.</p> <p>But agents don't always work. "When these tools are at their best, they'll auto resolve a lot of issues. ... When they're at their worst, they will go into like death spirals," said Voege, describing situations where the tools, far from resolving the issue at hand, get stuck in a testing loop. "I'm like, oh no, you're way off."</p>
<p>Cherny did not shy away from describing Claude like a somewhat high functioning person. "I think a good mental model [is that] it's like an expert programmer that's sitting next to you," he said. While he said it can serve as a "thought partner" in some cases, "in the end, it's a human that's doing the work."</p> <p>Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher who was invited to preview OpenAI's latest model, said it's plausible that AI could write a high percentage of code. However, Willison said, "I think they'll still need the same or even more humans involved in that process." That's because AI cannot think through higher-level problem solving like engineers do. "Our job is not to type code into a computer. Our job is to deliver systems that solve problems." Willison said.</p> <p>For Willison, who is known in the software world for tinkering with new tools and developing open-source ones, the productivity bump from using AI depends on choosing appropriate uses and having relevant expertise. "I am comfortable saying that for certain tasks, [for] programmers who are experienced programmers — those who can work without AI — with AI, they can get two to five times [the] productivity boost, sometimes more, depending on the specific task."</p> <p>Willison later wrote in his blog that the teams that benefit the most appear to adopt best practices in software development and collaboration.</p> <p>But that's not always what happens in real life. People are using AI regardless of whether it's needed, which sometimes results in more work for their colleagues. Researchers coined the term "workslop" to describe this.</p> <p>"A very high level engineer at the company was kind of very gung ho about AI coding and thought he could kind of get this very complicated project done very, very quickly on his own and tried running some AI tools," said one engineer at Amazon who is not authorized to speak publicly.</p>
<p>"[It] produced this just kind of messy blob of code that didn't work and nobody understood it. And the thing I'm working on now is just trying to actually do it kind of the old way."</p> <p>All this might explain why studies show mixed results when it comes to AI's impact. According to a study by AI evaluation nonprofit METR, experienced open-source software engineers who used LLMs ended up taking 19% longer to complete their tasks compared to peers who did not — contrary to the engineers' own expectations. In a national survey in Denmark, software engineers self-reported to have saved 6.5% of their time with AI. It was the highest of the 11 professions, which averaged out to 2.5%.</p> <p>"I'd definitely take 3% any day. It's like annual productivity growth in a typical occupation," said Anders Humlum, co-author of the Denmark study. "It's not nothing, but I would call it modest relative to the experiments."</p> <p>Engineers agree that AI shines more where accuracy matters less. "Knocking out a quick illustrated prototype would take me an hour [before] and now it takes me five minutes because I could just tell Claude to bash something [together]," said Willison. "The fact that it's going to make mistakes and stuff doesn't really matter too much."</p> <p>AI has helped cut back on some repetitive coding tasks at work, said Thomas Ptacek, a software developer at the cloud infrastructure company, fly.io. "Because I've written [a piece of code] many times before … I can also look at that code very quickly and get a sense of whether it's crazy or not."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Little room for disagreement</h3> <p>The Amazon software engineer said management encouraged staff to use AI in all parts of their work, even when there wasn't a case for using it. "It is very much a solution in search of problems much of the time," the engineer said.</p>
<p>The engineer said that all this is fostering a sense that there is little room for disagreement. "You have to use it more and it has to make you more efficient. If you're not, then you're doing something incorrectly."</p> <p>That said, the engineer also said the rhetoric's tangible effects on work and promotion vary across the organization.</p> <p>Amazon isn't the only tech company that appears to make assumptions about AI's effects on code. In a memo first reported by 404 Media and Wired, a Meta executive called for his department to achieve "5X productivity" in software as well as a broad set of other functions using AI. "The more we push ourselves, the more we'll unlock," he wrote in the memo. Two engineers were fired from an AI startup in San Francisco for not using an AI coding tool enough, The Information reported.</p> <p>Both the Amazon software engineer and Voege said they aren't the only engineers skeptical of AI in their workplace. A recent Google survey of software engineers across different countries and industries showed that while use of AI is near universal and improves aspects of software development, about half of respondents "somewhat" trusted AI's response, and 30% chose "a little" or "not at all."</p> <p>Many are also worried about employers replacing junior coders with AI, effectively cutting off the long-term talent supply that's needed to supervise the machines in the years to come. Others raise concerns about the massive amount of electricity and content made by humans that the largest models consume, even as dramatic capability improvements have begun to seem elusive.</p> <p>In a statement to NPR, Amazon spokesperson Tom Parnell said its in-house AI tools "help engineers move faster, ship more secure code, and spend less time on busywork" and that through surveys "engineers tell us these tools help them save time and feel more productive." He also said that the company does not mandate AI use, and cannot share what percentage of its software engineers regularly use large language model tools, but it believes "these tools can help developers work more efficiently."</p>
<p>Voege has since left his job and is now again thinking about starting his own business. He was floored by how much his old funder Y Combinator has gone from supporting different kinds of technologies to focusing solely on AI.</p> <p>He looked at the organization's latest request for startups. "It's just AI, AI, AI, five out of five."</p>

<div class="article-title">Some ant architects design a colony to cut the risk of disease. Humans, take note!</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Ants are many things. They're hard workers and intensely social. They're quite strong for their size. And now they may also be a source of architectural inspiration too — for designing spaces that reduce the spread of disease.</p> <p>This discovery comes from a new study focused on <em>Metarhizium brunneum</em>, a common and lethal fungus for insects, including the black garden ant. For this fungus to propagate, it kills its host, taking over the host ant's dead body and transforming it into something called a sporulating cadaver.</p> <p>"It's basically completely covered in spores and is highly infectious," says Nathalie Stroeymeyt, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Bristol.</p>
<p>In research in the journal <em>Science</em>, she and her colleagues report that black garden ants manipulate the structure of their nests to respond to this fungal pathogen and slow down its transmission.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Social distancing, ant-style</strong></h3> <p>In 2018, Stroeymeyt and her colleagues published a study that considered how small colonies of black garden ants respond socially to the introduction of the lethal fungus. The scientists glued tiny squares of paper with QR-like codes to the thoraxes of the ants and used an automated video tracking system to follow the movements of individuals over time.</p> <p>The infected workers quickly self-isolated. "They spend more time out of the colony to prevent contamination of their nestmates," she says.</p> <p>In addition, some of the healthy ants — the nurses that take care of the queen, eggs and larvae — increased their distance from the foragers, "which are the ones who go outside and are more at risk of contracting a disease," says Stroeymeyt. "So it was a form of proactive social distancing, if you wish."</p> <p>This work revealed that the ants altered their social behavior to protect themselves from infection and safeguard high-value members of the colony.</p> <p>Stroeymeyt wondered if the ants were making bigger changes — by altering the spaces they shared — the "hundreds of chambers connected by thousands of tunnels," as she puts it.</p>
<p>So Stroeymeyt teamed up with Luke Leckie, now a systems biologist at Indiana University Bloomington, to investigate whether the ants could shift how they excavated and built their nests when threatened by a pathogen.</p> <p>Leckie says ants are industrious and dynamic builders.</p>
<p>So that made him wonder: "Maybe they can manipulate the structure of their nest to avoid these transmission hotspots where there can be loads of interactions and protect the colony from the spread of epidemics."</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Architectural immunity</strong></h3> <p>To determine the impact of infection on nest architecture, Leckie and his colleagues gave small colonies of black garden ants a day to start building their nests. Then, in half of the nests, they introduced individual ants infected with the fungus.</p> <p>Over the course of six days, he took noninvasive CT scans of the nests. "They let us see the three-dimensional structure of the nests as it's developing over time," Leckie says.</p> <p>There were clear differences between the nests that were exposed to the pathogen and those that were not. According to computer simulations, these differences appeared to help lower disease transmission, reducing the risk of the fungal pathogen breaching the entire nest.</p> <p>First, the nests were more compartmentalized and less interconnected. Nest entrances were also spaced farther apart, reducing interactions between ants that were entering and exiting. Travel routes were longer, which made the nests less efficient but helped insulate healthy ants from infected ones.</p> <p>These structural changes had the overall effect of improving the ability of infected ants to isolate themselves, which Stroeymeyt had documented previously.</p> <p>The social and architectural changes "work together to really provide a very effective protection," she says. "It's a first demonstration of a social species outside of humans who actively modifies the spatial structure of the environment in face of a threat. That I find absolutely fascinating."</p>
<p>Sarah Kocher, an evolutionary biologist at Princeton University who wasn't involved in the study, says the findings deepen our understanding of something called social immunity found among many types of ants and bees.</p> <p>"Instead of relying on their individual immune systems," she says, "they work together as a group to try to minimize disease spread and utilize ways that their collective behaviors can help to defend them against these diseases."</p> <p>In addition, Kocher believes these ants have something to teach us.<strong> </strong>"Some of the principles could easily be applied to the way that we are designing public spaces that could help us prevent disease spread as well," she says.</p> <p>For instance, the ants seem to be protecting more vulnerable members of their community by isolating sections of their enclosure.</p> <p>Stroeymeyt agrees that we can seek inspiration from these ants, developing human ways of using architecture to reduce the risk of infection. "We can learn from social insects, which have evolved over millions of years," she says, "to find strategies that balance this protection against epidemic without completely disrupting the functioning of the entire colony."</p> <p>But she believes these connections will emerge down the road since the results in this paper are "too ant-like to have direct application today."</p> <p>So perhaps one day, humans will benefit from this notion of architectural immunity, inspired not by antibodies — but by ant bodies.</p>

But analysts say that the longer the shutdown continues, the bigger the dent it could leave.</p>
<ul class="edTag"><li>🎧 <strong>By law, federal workers are supposed to receive back pay once the shutdown ends</strong>, but the White House has attempted to cast doubt on that, NPR's Scott Horsley tells <em>Up First</em>. That rhetoric could result in some federal workers pulling back their spending habits, which could impact some of the businesses that those workers frequent. The total price tag of the shutdown is unknown, but past ones show that it has been costly for the government and the broader economy. Horsley says if Congress doesn't resolve the government shutdown by the beginning of next month, the food stamp program, which helps feed millions of people, may not be able to provide benefits.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Colombia announced yesterday that it will withdraw its ambassador to Washington. </strong>The country used to be the U.S.'s top ally in Latin America and a key partner in the war on drugs. But its relationship with the U.S. has deteriorated since President Trump started his second term. Colombia's decision to withdraw its ambassador comes after Trump threatened to cut U.S. aid to the country and intervene in Colombia to combat the flow of cocaine. <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>🎧<strong> Colombia's President Gustavo Petro is a leftist who disagrees with Trump on almost every issue and isn't afraid to say so</strong>, says reporter John Otis. Over the weekend, Petro expressed support for the "No Kings" rallies in the U.S. and said yesterday that his country doesn't accept kings. Colombia receives around $230 million a year in U.S. aid. Otis says much of those funds go towards helping the Colombians fight the drug cartels.</li></ul> <p><strong>French authorities are still searching for the culprits who stole millions of dollars' worth of jewels from the Louvre on Sunday. </strong>The heist showcased huge gaps in security at the museum.

<ul class="edTag"><li>🎧 <strong>Prosecutors say they are not ruling anything out as a possibility in finding who did this.</strong> Time is of the essence in the investigation as the thieves will likely dismantle the jewels, melt down the gold and sell the gems separately, says NPR's Eleanor Beardsley.

<p>Medical marijuana is a common resource for people with chronic pain, but there are few high-quality studies on whether it is beneficial. That's why two major clinical trials in Europe that evaluated cannabis for low back pain caught the attention of those investigating the plant's potential for pain management. The first showcased that a blend of cannabis oil, containing the psychoactive compound THC, as well as CBD and other natural compounds in the plant, outperformed a placebo. The other trial compares the same proprietary cannabis elixir with opioids, revealing that patients who used the elixir experienced fewer gastrointestinal side effects like constipation than when using painkillers. <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>➡️ Medical cannabis proponents say that the drug's safety is a clear upside compared to opioids because it does not come with the same concerns regarding overdose and addiction.</li><li>➡️ Currently, there is one cannabis-derived medication approved by the FDA, and it does not contain any THC. Though it isn't entirely clear, experts believe THC is one of the primary compounds responsible for reducing pain.</li><li>➡️ While most Americans reside in states where marijuana is legal, there are significant concerns about the quality and consistency of cannabis products.

<div class="article-title">Hakeem Jeffries says public pressure will force Congress to extend ACA subsidies</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he believes public pressure will mount on Republicans in the coming days to extend health insurance subsidies that are the heart of the shutdown fight.</p> <p>Most of the federal government remains shut down after Senate Republicans and Democrats again failed to pass a spending bill Monday that would reopen the government. Democrats, who have put forward their own spending resolution, remain steadfast that Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies used by more than 20 million people to afford monthly health premiums should be extended.</p> <p>With the credits expiring at the end of the year and ACA open enrollment beginning Nov. 1, many buying insurance through their state's marketplace are likely to see their monthly costs soar.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em>Morning Edition</em>, Jeffries said he believes "it will become readily apparent to people throughout America why it is so important for Congress to act to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits."</p> <p>Some Republicans have proposed a one-year extension of the ACA subsidies, which Jeffries has opposed. In a separate interview with <em>Morning Edition</em>, GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said Democrats knew the subsidies would expire and dared Jeffries to sign onto the one-year extension if he was "serious" about it.</p>
<p>In response, Jeffries said that "If billionaires can be provided tax breaks on a permanent basis in ways that will explode the deficit all across the country and result in people losing their health insurance … it seems to us that Republicans should come to the table to provide a greater degree of certainty as it relates to health care that's being provided to working class Americans," referring to President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act.</p> <p>Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Jeffries discussed how the shutdown is playing out and why Democrats remain adamant on their position.</p> <p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity. </em></p> <h3 class="edTag">Interview highlights</h3> <p><strong>Michel Martin: </strong>Last night, the Senate failed for the 11th time to pass a measure that would extend current funding until the end of the year, effectively reopen the government. Republicans insist they'll negotiate on health care once the government reopens. Remind us again about why that position is unacceptable to the Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: </strong>Well, we've made clear that we want to reopen the government. We want to find a bipartisan path forward toward a spending agreement that actually makes life better for the American people. But we also need to decisively resolve the Republican health care crisis that is crushing people all across the country, particularly as it relates to the need to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. Open enrollment starts on Nov. 1. That's less than two weeks from now. And tens of millions of Americans are receiving notices as we speak, indicating that their health insurance premiums, co-pays and deductibles are about to skyrocket double, triple — or in some cases, quadruple — at levels that will be unaffordable, which is why these issues taken together need to be addressed at this moment without further delay.</p> <p><strong>Martin: </strong>So as you just pointed out, Nov. 1 is a crucial date because that's when most states will start to send out notices spelling out the cost of coverage, without the subsidies, those huge price hikes that you just mentioned that you're trying to protect buyers from, will have already happened. If we get to that point and there is still no deal, what then?</p> <p><strong>Jeffries: </strong>Well, the open enrollment period, which begins on Nov. 1, will last until the early to mid part of December. The pressure is going to continue to mount on the Congress to take decisive action during that period of time, as people all across America realize that things are about to get extremely costly in states like Georgia, Virginia and Maryland. We now have visibility into the fact that costs may increase on a monthly basis by approximately $2,000 per month. That means that health insurance premiums could actually increase to over $24,000 a year. That's unaffordable. The average income of someone who receives an Affordable Care Act tax credit is around $63,000 a year. And so clearly, these type of premium increases for people to get access to a doctor when they need them are unsustainable. And so over the next few weeks, it will become readily apparent to people throughout America why it is so important for Congress to act to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. And by the way, health insurance costs are going to increase for people who receive assistance through the tax credits on the Affordable Care Act, as well as people who receive their health insurance from their employer as well.</p>
<p><em>Editor's note: About 90% of ACA premium tax credit recipients have annual incomes at or below $63,000, </em><em>according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</em><em>. </em></p>
<p><strong>Martin: </strong>So yesterday you said that you'd oppose GOP legislation to pay military service members. That's something that President Trump already says he's going to do. And then this bill would also pay essential federal workers. You say you oppose this because you call it a political ploy. Notwithstanding the fact that you argue that this would give the president discretion to decide who would get paid and who wouldn't get paid. And you feel that that's not right. There still are a lot of workers in those groups who would face real hardship without pay. What do you say to them?</p> <p><strong>Jeffries: </strong>I support the military being paid. We, in fact, on the Democratic side of the House, have introduced legislation to ensure that that happens. In terms of the legislation that Sen. Ron Johnson [R-Wisc.] apparently was putting forward or may plan to put forward in the Senate, it gives President Trump wide discretion to decide who gets paid, who doesn't get paid, what happens in terms of furloughed workers who apparently will not be addressed in this legislation. And he's already threatened not to pay furloughed workers, even though that's contrary to federal law that he himself signed in 2019. This has been a lawless administration from day one of this presidency and allowing them to have further discretion as to how they may proceed, particularly when they have targeted hard working federal civil servants from the very beginning of this term in extraordinary ways is not an appropriate step forward. It's piecemeal, it's not comprehensive. And we need to reopen the government in its entirety. And we're ready to do that as Democrats. We just need partners on the other side of the aisle in terms of a willingness to proceed in good faith.</p>
