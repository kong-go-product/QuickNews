<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A hard-fought win by the Kansas City Chiefs over the Detroit Lions took a wild turn once the final whistle blew on Sunday night as a brawl broke out among players.</p><p>Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes was going up to Lions defensive back Brian Branch for a postgame handshake. Branch snubbed Mahomes’ sportsmanship and it appeared wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster took exception to that.</p><p>Smith-Schuster and Branch exchanged words before the defensive back shoved the wide receiver in the helmet. Smith-Schuster went down on one knee and running back Isiah Pacheco was trying to hold the Lions player back. Smith-Schuster came back at Branch, trying to take him down. </p><p>Despite being held back by Pacheco, Branch still managed to rip Smith-Schuster’s helmet off. Players from both teams got into the mix trying to pull the two counterparts off each other. Another punch was thrown as the skirmish ended.</p><p>Once the brouhaha subsided, the players said their final farewell to each other and headed back into the locker room.</p><p>The NFL is likely to dole out some punishment over the fracas.</p><p>Kansas City won the game, 30-17, bouncing back from a tough loss on Monday night against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

<div class="article-title">Chiefs bounce back with dominant home victory over Lions as Patrick Mahomes contributes 4 touchdowns</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Kansas City Chiefs, coming off a loss, got right back on track with a dominant home win against the Detroit Lions, 30-17, on "Sunday Night Football."</p><p>The Chiefs got back to .500 with a 3-3 record, while the Lions had their four-game win streak snapped as they moved to 4-2 on the year. </p><p>It was expected that both teams would pull out all the stops, as two of the best offenses in the NFL went against each other yet again at Arrowhead. But there were some key miscues from the Lions that ultimately left them behind. </p><p>One of those key moments came on the first drive, as they went 15 plays downfield, killing almost 10 full minutes of first-quarter clock that came to a head on fourth-and-goal from the one-yard line. Of course, a Dan Campbell-led Lions squad was going for it that close to the goal line, but some trickery was involved. </p><p>Quarterback Jared Goff, originally under center, went in motion out to the left and running back David Montgomery threw a pass to him. Goff bobbled it initially, but he was able to regain control and get into the end zone for an impressive touchdown. However, after deliberation, it was determined by officials that Goff never got set and it was a flag for illegal motion. Jake Bates had to kick a field goal instead to go up 3-0. </p><p>Patrick Mahomes, meanwhile, made sure to respond with a touchdown, and he did so much faster than the Lions’ opening drive. He found Xavier Worthy for his first touchdown of the season, though Harrison Butker was way off with his extra point, keeping the score at 6-3. </p><p>The Lions were able to find the end zone on the ensuing drive as Jameson Williams, who has been quiet in recent weeks despite the win streak, fought off multiple Chiefs tacklers for a 22-yard catch-and-run for six points. </p><p>Detroit was able to get the Chiefs to turn the ball over on downs, and they had the opportunity to really pull ahead on the road. But Goff’s fourth-and-2 pass from the Kansas City 44-yard line didn’t find itself secure in Amon-Ra St. Brown’s hands despite their rock-solid connection. Momentum quickly shifted in the Chiefs’ favor, and Mahomes used all of it to take the lead. </p><p>This time, Mahomes rushed for his fourth touchdown of the season, keeping it on a read option and scoring with 37 seconds left. </p><p>With the Chiefs getting the ball to start the second half, that touchdown was a hard one to swallow for Campbell’s crew, and Detroit found itself in an even bigger hole when the third quarter began. </p><p>Mahomes was methodical when play resumed, and he found Hollywood Brown for the first of his two second-half touchdowns to take a 20-10 lead. The Lions were able to cut the lead to three when the fourth quarter began, as tight end Sam LaPorta made a tremendous one-handed catch for six points. </p><p>But, just when it appeared the Lions were getting going again, Mahomes made their defense pay. It was Brown again, who found himself wide open on third-and-short near the goal line. </p><p>After Butker added a field goal to make it 30-17, the Lions needed a miracle to come back from that deficit with just 2:26 left on the clock. But, once again, they were unable to connect on fourth-and-short, which ended their hopes. </p><p>In the box score, Mahomes performed beautifully with 257 yards and three touchdowns on 22-of-30 through the air, while rushing for 31 yards on 10 carries. Tight end Travis Kelce, with his fiancée Taylor Swift attending her first NFL game of the season tonight, led the way with six catches for 78 yards. </p><p>Meanwhile, for the Lions, Goff was 23-of-29 for 203 yards with his two touchdown passes. St. Brown had nine catches, but they only went for 45 yards. The Chiefs’ defense also did a great job slowing the run game of Jahmyr Gibbs (17 carries, 65 yards) and David Montgomery (four carries, 24 yards).  </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Ravens expect Lamar Jackson to return in Week 8 after fourth straight loss</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Baltimore Ravens are heading into their bye week a shocking 1-5 after losing their fourth straight game, but reinforcements are on the way. </p><p>Lamar Jackson, who has missed the last two games with a hamstring injury, is expected to return in Week 8 against the Chicago Bears, head coach John Harbaugh told media members after losing to the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. </p><p>"We’re going to have healthy players coming back," Harbaugh said, per the team’s official website. "Our quarterback’s going to be back."</p><p>Harbaugh was asked if he "for sure" knows that Jackson will be back. </p><p>"I mean for sure? I’m saying so, but I don’t know," he responded. "That’s how life is sometimes. You can’t predict everything. It’s still the future, but that’s the hope."</p><p>The Ravens have felt Jackson’s loss the past two games, as their offense has combined for just 13 points over that span. </p><p>Cooper Rush, Jackson’s backup quarterback to begin the season, has been the starter for Harbaugh these last two losses, and he’s struggled to get anything going. As the offense sputtered against the Rams on Sunday, Harbaugh made the call to go to Tyler "Snoop" Huntley, though that didn’t change much either. </p><p>Rush threw for 72 yards with an interception, while Huntley went 10-of-15 for 68 yards, while also rushing for 39 yards.</p><p>Jackson, the two-time MVP, will need to get the Ravens’ offense back on track if they wish to get back to the playoffs. It’s an uphill battle now considering the record, but the Ravens know they have a "generational player" leading them. </p><p>"You can’t replace him with anybody," running back Justice Hill said. "Obviously, getting him back will be a huge leap for our offense."</p><p>Through four games this season, Jackson has thrown for 869 yards with 10 touchdowns to just one interception. On the ground, he’s rushed for 166 yards with a score as well. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Taylor Swift watches Travis Kelce and Chiefs with Caitlin Clark for first time since album drop</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>As her album "The Life of a Showgirl" continues to top the charts, Taylor Swift is back at Arrowhead Stadium to watch her fiancé, Travis Kelce, and the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Detroit Lions. </p><p>And Caitlin Clark also made the trip back to Kansas City to enjoy some Chiefs'football alongside one of her favorite music artists. </p><p>Swift and Clark were spotted in a suite at the stadium during "Sunday Night Football" broadcast, where Ed Kelce, the future father-in-law of Swift, was also seen. This marks the first time Swift has been to a game to watch Kelce since her album dropped on Oct. 3. </p><p>Swift wasn’t present in Jacksonville as the Chiefs fell to the Jaguars on "Monday Night Football," but Donna Kelce, the famous mother of both Travis and Jason Kelce, was seen supporting her future daughter-in-law with a Swift-inspired hat that had various phrases on it related to the pop star while attending the game. </p><p>Swift recently spoke about her album on BBC Radio 2 and shut down a question about whether her latest album could be her last as she’s set to get married to the star tight end.</p><p>"That's a shockingly offensive thing to say," Swift said. "It's not why people get married, so that they can quit their jobs."</p><p>With Swift committed to her craft, she also loves watching Kelce remain committed to his own. And she seems to enjoy having Clark as company given her own Chiefs fandom.</p><p>Clark revealed this summer what she and Swift were seen whispering about in a suite during the Chiefs’ playoff game against the Houston Texans back in January. </p><p>"Honestly, I love football, and I know a lot about football," Clark responded to the question from Sue Bird and Megan Rapinoe on their "A Touch More" podcast So, I was telling her why they threw a flag or like — but in the best way. Like, I don't even know everything.</p><p>"I was just explaining things, but, yeah, that was really fun. I’m a big Chiefs fan. So, getting to spend time with Taylor, and then also Travis [Kelce] played really well that game — the Chiefs won, it was the playoffs." </p><p>Clark has noted that Swift "treats everybody with the same amount of kindness," as she told ESPN back in May. </p><p>Kelce has had a good start to the 2025 season, his 13th in the NFL, as he has 22 receptions for 243 yards with two touchdowns, including one in the loss to the Jaguars. </p><p><i>Fox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.</i></p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Ben Stiller says he felt like he was 'failing' during separation from wife Christine Taylor</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Ben Stiller is opening up about why he felt like he was "failing" following his separation from his wife.</p><p>In his new documentary, "Stiller &amp; Meara: Nothing Is Lost," the 59-year-old "Zoolander" star explores his parents’ decades-long partnership, comparing it to his own marriage with Christine Taylor.</p><p>Ben and Taylor married in 2000 and announced their separation in May 2017 after 17 years together.</p><p>"When we separated, my feeling was like ‘Oh, I’m failing at this’ and look at my parents. They have this incredible 50-plus year marriage and I can’t live up to that," he tells Taylor in the documentary, per People.</p><p>The documentary follows the relationship between his father, Jerry Stiller, and his mother, Anne Meara, who performed together as the iconic comedy duo, Stiller and Meara. Together they made over 30 appearances on "The Ed Sullivan Show" and later had their own short-lived variety show, "The Stiller and Meara Show."</p><p>Ben and Taylor also worked together a number of times during their relationship. They first met while filming the pilot of a TV show called "Heat Vision and Jack," and went on to star alongside each other in "Zoolander" and "Dodgeball." Looking back, Ben recalled wondering "what kind of toll" his parents' working relationship put on their marriage and remembered not wanting to be like his parents when he first began dating Taylor.</p><p>"I do feel like there was history and I think a lot of it was your experience of what that ultimately meant for a relationship that it could put extra strain when you're eating, sleeping, breathing each other in that way," Taylor told Ben in the documentary. "I also felt like there was a fear from you for me of what that would look like to the outside world. I mean it was very loaded." </p><p>The "Tropic Thunder" star previously spoke about his separation from Taylor during a January 2025 interview with The New York Times, in which he explained, "In my mind, I never didn’t want us to be together."</p><p>Their separation lasted "three or four years," and the two were in contact throughout that time. They later moved into the same house during the COVID-19 pandemic with their two children, Ella, 23, and Quinlin, 20.</p><p>"I don’t know where Christine was, you’d have to ask her, but COVID put us all together in the same house," he explained. "It was almost a year of living in the same house before we were actually together. But I’m so grateful for it, and I think not that many people do come back together when they separate."</p><p>Taylor also discussed their separation during a March 2023 appearance on "The Drew Barrymore Show," explaining that during their separation the two "got to know who we are."</p><p>She added that they got engaged six months after meeting each other "were married within a year, then had [daughter Ella] the next year."</p><p>"Family was always a priority, but I think Ben and I both started to grow in different directions," Taylor said. "And when we made the decision to separate, it was not something we wanted to talk publicly about or took lightly."</p><p>"I think we have these growth spurts, even as adults," she later added. "And we needed time to figure that out."</p><p>"Stiller &amp; Meara: Nothing Is Lost," is set to premiere on Apple TV + on Oct. 24.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Detroit Lions were hoping that a long drive to start their Sunday night game against the Kansas City Chiefs was going to end with a touchdown – and it nearly did.</p><p>The Lions got the ball down to the Chiefs’ 1-yard line after running back Jahmyr Gibbs was stopped from scoring on third down. The team decided to try for a touchdown on 4th-and-goal.</p><p>Lions quarterback Jared Goff was under center with running back David Montgomery behind him. He decided to break out to the left, as Montgomery received the snap. The veteran running back threw the ball to Goff, who bobbled it before regaining control and got into the end zone for what was thought to be a touchdown.</p><p>However, the officials talked it over and threw a penalty flag for illegal motion. Goff, according to "Sunday Night Football" rules analyst Terry McAulay, needed to pause for a second before he started to move in motion. The score was taken off the board.</p><p>Detroit opted for a field goal and went up 3-0. It was a 15-play, 61-yard drive to start the game.</p><p>The Lions came into the game with a 4-1 record. Detroit has been the highest-scoring team in the NFL this season. After putting up 13 points in a Week 1 loss to the Green Bay Packers, Detroit has scored at least 34 points in each of their last four games.</p><p>It didn’t seem as though the Lions were willing to pull their foot off the gas pedal against the Chiefs. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump said he may send Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not settle the war, calling the weapon "incredible" and "very offensive."</p><p>Trump, while speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night, was asked about his recent conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and military aid.</p><p>Trump said he spoke with Zelenskyy on Sunday morning, and Zelenskyy asked about Ukraine’s need for additional weapons in its fight against Russia.</p><p>Trump said the U.S. sells and sends weapons to NATO, unlike the Biden administration, which, he said, gave Ukraine $350 billion.</p><p>"We gave him nothing, but we gave them respect and some other things," Trump said.</p><p>He said he hopes the U.S. can provide more arms, but added that the country must also keep enough to defend itself.</p><p>"They need Patriots very badly. They’d like to have Tomahawks. That’s a step up," Trump said. "We talked about that, so we’ll see."</p><p>Before agreeing to send Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, Trump said he may first speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin to see if Moscow wants missiles headed its way.</p><p>"I don’t think so," Trump said. "I might speak to Russia about that, in all fairness. I told that to President Zelenskyy because Tomahawks are a new step of aggression."</p><p>As for a potential conversation about Putin, Trump said he might have to tell him, "if this war is not going to get settled, I’m going to send them Tomahawks."</p><p>"The Tomahawk is an incredible weapon, a very offensive weapon, and honestly, Russia does not need that," Trump said. "I may tell him that if the war is not settled, we may very well. We may not, but we may do it. I think it’s appropriate to bring up."</p><p>"I want to see the war settled," Trump added.</p><p>Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X on Sunday that his talks with Trump "covered all the aspects of the situation," including Ukraine’s defense of life and efforts to strengthen its air defense, resilience, and long-range capabilities.</p><p>Zelenskyy added that they also discussed "many details" involving the energy sector, though he did not elaborate.</p><p>"President Trump is well informed about everything that is happening," Zelenskyy wrote. "We agreed to continue our dialogue, and our teams are doing their preparations."</p><p>Trump’s talks with Zelenskyy come as Moscow continues to strike Ukraine with drones and missiles, wounding at least 20 people in Kyiv and causing widespread blackouts Friday. A child was also killed in a separate Russian attack in the southeast.</p><p>Late Saturday and early Sunday, Russia attacked Ukraine’s power grid in an effort to degrade the country’s energy infrastructure ahead of winter.</p><p>The latest grid attack, similar to Russia’s annual pre-winter strikes, came as Moscow expressed "extreme concern" over the U.S. potentially providing Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Dozens have been killed in Gaza during violent fighting Sunday and within hours of the expected release of hostages in the war-torn region, according to local reports.</p><p>The clashes between local militias also came ahead of a televised address in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the imminent hostage release "the beginning of a new path."</p><p>The Israeli president had cautioned, "The campaign is not over. There are still very great security challenges ahead of us."</p><p>Locals said gunfire had sent families fleeing in panic. </p><p>"This time people weren’t fleeing Israeli attacks. They were running from their own people," one witness told the BBC.</p><p>According to reports via Israeli outlet Ynet, the violence erupted when Hamas militants raided the neighborhood of Sabra in Gaza City, home to a clan called Doghmush, also known as the Al Doghmush family militia.</p><p>The report said the Hamas Interior Ministry had accused a militia of attacking its forces, while members of the Doghmush clan said Hamas had exploited the ceasefire to target them over alleged cooperation with Israel.</p><p>"Children are screaming and dying, they are burning our houses," a relative of the clan told Ynet.</p><p>"We are trapped. I don’t know how they entered with all kinds of weapons. Where were they when the Jews were here? They arrested all the youths, lined them up against walls, pointed weapons at their heads. There is a massacre here," another member said.</p><p>In total, Ynet reported 52 members of the Doghmush clan were killed and 12 Hamas militants were killed.</p><p>Hamas’s television channel claimed that among those killed was blogger Salah al-Ja‘farawi, who reportedly celebrated the Oct. 7 attacks online. The terrorist-run station claimed the blogger was shot dead by "armed gangs operating outside the law" while covering the clashes.</p><p>Also killed was the son of senior Hamas official Basem Naim, according to reporting by the Jerusalem Post.</p><p>A senior clan member told Ynet, "We still say – you must not shed Muslim blood by a Muslim."</p><p>Hamas’s Interior and National Security Ministry later announced a "clemency framework" allowing militia members and criminals not involved in bloodshed to surrender by next Sunday, warning that those who do not comply will be "punished severely."</p><p>Amid the bloodshed, three anti-Hamas militias publicly declared their support for President Trump’s peace proposal, rejecting Hamas’s authority in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>Israel said Hamas is expected to release 20 living hostages to the Red Cross by 5 a.m. Eastern (noon in Gaza) Monday.</p><p>The hostages are to be transported in six to eight vehicles under Red Cross supervision, and handed over to Israeli forces inside Gaza.

<div class="article-title">Colin Hanks calls interview questions about John Candy's weight 'heartbreaking'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Colin Hanks is reflecting on the way comedian John Candy was treated by the press during interviews in his heyday.</p><p>During a recent appearance on the "Happy Sad Confused" podcast, the 47-year-old filmmaker discussed the insensitive ways Candy was asked about his weight during interviews, calling it "heartbreaking," and saying the line of questioning he endured "would not fly in this day and age."</p><p>"That, particularly, was so soul-crushing to me, to see first off, how uncomfortable John was in an interview, and it was because, deep down, he knew, 'They're going to ask about my weight,'" he explained. "And you go, 'Well, why is that a big deal?' Well, when you see how people asked him about his weight, it all makes sense."</p><p>The director of the new documentary, "John Candy: I Like Me," said "that kind of stuff was just heartbreaking" but was ultimately "the kind of stuff I want to explore" in the film.</p><p>He also discussed the topic during an interview with Esquire in October, commending him for keeping his cool despite the way he was treated.</p><p>"But the thing about John is that he had every right to tell those people off, and yet he didn’t," he said. "If they’re going to ask those questions, that’s on them. That was a very interesting way that he dealt with that. But again, all of that speaks to what the latter half of the film explores, those pressures. All those things add up."</p><p>In the documentary, which was also produced by Ryan Reynolds, audiences will get an inside look at the life, career and death of the legendary comedian, who died of a heart attack at the age of 43 in 1994. The documentary features interviews from those who knew him, including Bill Murray, Catherine O'Hara and Steve Martin, with his children, Jennifer Candy and Chris Candy, serving as producers.</p><p>"The documentary highlights how he did think he was on borrowed time," Chris, 41, told Fox News Digital. </p><p>"One of the main things that I really appreciate and take away from this film is that he really was trying to turn the boat around toward the end of his life," he added. "He was taking better care of himself. But it takes a long time to really do that effective work. And of course, we wish we had gotten more of that time. But the fact that the effort was there, the attempt was there on a real level, was, I think, the main goal of what we wanted to get out about our dad."</p><p>In the documentary, audiences learn that John's struggle with anxiety was at its worst towards the end of his life, but kept his struggles to himself. Chris told Fox News Digital that while "he never talked about it," they "knew it was happening."</p><p>During a Q&amp;A and screening of the documentary in New York on Oct. 9, Chris also spoke about the way his father was asked about his weight, admitting he "was kind of shocked to see how interviewers treat him."</p><p>"I learned through the process of this that he was so nervous about eating in front of people because of the paparazzi," he said per People. "He developed a poor eating habit where he'd be like, 'Alright, well I'm not going to eat all day. I'm going to eat at night when I get home and I'm in privacy.' When I hear stories like that, I just feel so bad for him."</p><p>The comedian rose to fame and established himself in the world of comedy as a main cast member on "SCTV" from 1976 to 1984, where he created many iconic characters.</p><p>After a few small roles in films during the late 1970s and early 1980s, he made his breakthrough in Hollywood in films such as "Splash," "Spaceballs" and "Uncle Buck." His final on-screen role was in the 1994 movie, "Wagons East!" which was released five months after his death. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Japan’s ancient capital is taking drastic steps to rein in overtourism. </p><p>Starting in March 2026, Kyoto will introduce the highest accommodation tax in Japan, charging visitors more to stay in the city’s hotels, inns and guesthouses.</p><p>Under the new system, tourists at high-end hotels could pay up to ¥10,000 (about $65) per person, per night, in tourism taxes: a tenfold increase from current rates. </p><p>Budget travelers will also see jumps from about ¥200 to ¥400 (about $1.30 to $2.60), while mid-range rooms will jump from ¥500 to ¥1,000 (about $3.30 to $6.50) per person.</p><p>City officials say the extra funds are expected to more than double Kyoto’s tourism tax revenue and will go toward managing crowds, preserving cultural sites, and easing strain on local infrastructure.</p><p>When applying to hike the fee, Kyoto travel authorities insisted that tourists should bear the cost of maintaining the very attractions that draw them into the city.</p><p>While tourism drives Kyoto’s economy, many residents say the city has become nearly unlivable in peak seasons. Narrow streets clogged with selfie-snapping visitors, and popular districts like Gion, known for its traditional tea houses and geisha, have attempted to crack down on tourists after incidents of trespassing and aggressive photography. Japanese media reports these efforts have been unsuccessful.</p><p>The new tax aims to fund enforcement and reduce friction between visitors and locals, but critics warn it may not go far enough. Japan welcomed more than 35 million foreign tourists in 2024, and officials hope to reach 60 million by 2030.</p><p>Kyoto isn’t alone in feeling the squeeze. Fox News Digital previously reported that Mount Fuji, another of Japan’s iconic destinations, is dealing with its own side effects of booming tourism. </p><p>Trash, overcrowding and safety concerns have grown so severe that officials have begun calling the landmark a "trash mountain."</p><p>Visitors are being asked to pack out their garbage and respect new crowd limits, as local authorities scramble to protect the mountain’s natural beauty.</p><p>Kyoto’s move may be a sign of what’s ahead for other tourist-heavy regions. As Japan’s popularity surges, cities are being forced to choose between economic opportunity and preserving the peace that makes them so popular in the first place.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump will spend the first part of the week in the Middle East to oversee a historic peace deal between Israel and Hamas, a landmark agreement expected to end the two-year war in Gaza and bring home the remaining hostages.</p><p>Before boarding Air Force One, Trump told reporters that the hostages could be released earlier and said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did a "very good job" helping secure the deal.</p><p>"The war is over," Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before boarding a nearly 12-hour flight to Israel. After landing in Tel Aviv, Trump is expected to meet with families of hostages and then give an address at the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, in Jerusalem.</p><p>Trump will then travel to Egypt to attend an international summit in the seaside city of Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday to finalize an agreement aimed at ending the war in Gaza. More than 20 world leaders, including Trump, are expected to attend, an Egyptian presidential spokesperson said, according to Reuters.</p><p>After a handful of hours in Israel and Egypt, Trump will board Air Force One and return to the White House in the early morning hours on Tuesday in order to honor the late Charlie Kirk with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian award.</p><p>"It's a very quick trip, but I'll be making two major stops, and then I'll be on the plane trying to get back in time for Charlie," Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. "They're going to have a great celebration at the White House in the East Room," he added. The award ceremony coincides with what would have been Kirk’s 32nd birthday on Oct. 14.</p><p>Kirk, the charismatic founder of Turning Point USA (TPUSA), gained recognition for his signature political debates on college campuses. He was assassinated on Sept. 10, during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University. The gathering was the first stop on TPUSA’s planned "American Comeback Tour."</p><p>Kirk's memorial service drew one of the largest public turnouts for a private citizen, with about 90,000 people in attendance at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona and nearby overflow venues.</p><p>Trump previously announced last month that he would award Kirk the award posthumously.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Cincinnati Bengals kicker Evan McPherson almost rewrote the NFL record books on Sunday when he lined up for a 67-yard field goal to end the first half against the Green Bay Packers. </p><p>McPherson’s kick banged off the crossbar of the goal post and went through the uprights. Unfortunately, Packers head coach Matt LaFleur called a timeout before the kick went off, and it didn’t count. </p><p>The longest field goal in NFL history is 66 yards, knocked in by former Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker. McPherson put his all into the kick, and with a little help from the wind at his back, it would’ve finally put the Bengals on the board. </p><p>Instead, McPherson was forced to try the kick again, and he didn’t have the same muscle in his kick as it was a few yards short. Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon had the opportunity to return the kick, but he didn’t get far as the half came to an end. </p><p>While Tucker owns the record after hitting the kick in 2021, Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Cam Little hit a 70-yard field goal, but it was in a preseason game. So, that stands as an unofficial record despite the incredible feat. </p><p>At the time, the Bengals could’ve certainly used those points as they were struggling on offense yet again, though they have a new quarterback under center. </p><p>Cincinnati made the surprising trade with their division-rival Cleveland Browns to acquire veteran Joe Flacco, as Jake Browning hadn’t panned out since the Joe Burrow injury earlier in the season. </p><p>Head coach Zac Taylor is hoping to get his offense going more with Flacco at the helm, though the first half was no indication of such production. </p><p>The Bengals couldn’t put anything on the board, while their defense held the Packers to just 10 points.  </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi gave a playful response to actress Amy Poehler’s parody of her on NBC’s "Saturday Night Live."</p><p>Poehler, who hosted Saturday’s episode, appeared in the cold open as Bondi during her testimony at a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing last week.</p><p>"My name is Pam Bondi. I spell it with an ‘i,’ because I ain’t gonna answer any of your questions," Poehler said. "My time is valuable. The DOJ has many ongoing operations, and we’re moving like Kash Patel’s eyeballs—very quickly in multiple directions at once."</p><p>During the skit, Poehler was later joined by her fellow former "SNL" cast member Tina Fey, who played Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem carrying an AR-15 rifle.</p><p>"That’s right. It’s me, Kristi Noem," Fey said. "I spell my name with an ‘i’ because that’s how I thought it was spelled. And I’m the rarest type of person in Washington, D.C.: a brunette that Donald Trump listens to."</p><p>Though the show took many jabs at Bondi’s demeanor during the hearing, Bondi appeared to enjoy the parody on Sunday morning and invited Noem to respond on X.</p><p>"@Sec_Noem, should we recreate this picture in Chicago? Loving Amy Poehler!" Bondi wrote. </p><p>In a comment to Fox News Digital, DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin simply responded, "SNL is absolutely right—the Democrats' shutdown does need to end!"</p><p>The long-running sketch comedy series has often mocked President Donald Trump and his administration, usually with some backlash from Trump himself. However, the show’s 51st season premiere went largely unremarked on by the president despite another parody of him by cast member James Austin Johnson.</p><p>In a comment after the premiere, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson dismissed the show, saying she has "more entertaining" things to do with her time.</p><p>"Reacting to this would require me to waste my time watching it," Jackson said.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Carolina Panthers must have loved last week's come-from-behind victory so much that they decided to do it again, this time against the Dallas Cowboys at home. </p><p>The Panthers moved to 3-3 after a walk-off field goal in a 30-27 victory over the Cowboys, who are now 2-3-1 this season. </p><p>It was a back-and-forth offensive show at Bank of America Stadium on Sunday morning, but the Panthers got the three-and-out they needed in the fourth quarter to set up the game-winning drive. </p><p>There was plenty of time on the clock for Carolina, but they were able to milk the final 6:01 to deny the Cowboys a chance at a rebuttal in the end. Bryce Young and the Panthers’ offense started on their own 14-yard line, and proceeded to go 15 plays, converting on multiple key downs including a fourth-and-4 on Dallas’ 40-yard line to eventually set up a 33-yard field goal for Ryan Fitzgerald. </p><p>As the clock struck zero, Fitzgerald was money, and the Panthers were celebrating yet again after putting together back-to-back wins. </p><p>While that drive was thrilling, Young was earlier able to help rookie wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan fulfill a milestone, securing his first career touchdown. McMillan hauled in a 19-yard strike from Young to finally get into the end zone after not doing so the previous five weeks. </p><p>But McMillan didn’t just settle for one in this game. Early in the fourth quarter, a scrambling Young found him again for his second score to give Carolina a 27-24 lead. Young’s third touchdown pass of the day went to Rico Dowdle, who had quite the revenge game against his former Cowboys squad on a 36-yard catch-and-run to kick off the second half. </p><p>While Young had a solid day with 199 passing yards and three touchdowns, Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott was once again playing brilliantly to help his team get in position for a win. </p><p>It’s been a roller coaster for Cowboys fans this year, but one thing that has been steady is the offense. Prescott threw for 261 yards with three touchdowns, including one to George Pickens, who led the game with 168 yards on nine receptions. Prescott also found tight end Jake Ferguson (3 catches, 33 yards) as well as fullback Hunter Luepke for his first career receiving touchdown. </p><p>The Cowboys, though, couldn’t come through on that three-and-out drive, as two short passes to running back Javonta Williams were snuffed out by the Panthers’ defense to force an early punt. </p><p>Riding high on this win streak, the Panthers will hit the road in an attempt to keep it going against the New York Jets next week. Meanwhile, the Cowboys will have a tough divisional matchup with the Washington Commanders as they return to Dallas. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump said Sunday that Hamas may release the 20 hostages it is holding "a little bit early."</p><p>Trump spoke with reporters aboard Air Force One en route to the Middle East, where he was asked about the latest on the hostages and when they might be released.</p><p>"So, they have the hostages — I understand all 20 — and we may get them out a little bit early," Trump said. "Getting them was amazing, actually, because we were involved, and they were in places you don’t want to know about."</p><p>The president’s comments come as Hamas faces a deadline to return all remaining hostages to Israel, following a peace deal that ended the two-year-long Israel-Hamas war.</p><p>The peace agreement, brokered by President Trump, sparked celebrations across a region plagued by violence since the Hamas terror attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.</p><p>Trump described the peace agreement as historic, saying it was the first time in 3,000 years that Jews, Muslims, and Arab nations were "dancing in the streets." He said the deal had unified countries that were once bitter enemies and that Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other regional powers were "all into this deal."</p><p>When asked about the fighting, Trump declared that the conflict had come to an end.</p><p>"The war is over," the president said.</p><p>He expressed confidence that the ceasefire would hold, saying people were "tired" of centuries of conflict.</p><p>"Everybody knows their place," Trump said, adding that peace "is going to be great for everybody."</p><p>The president said rebuilding Gaza would begin quickly, though he cautioned that the region resembled a "demolition site." He said reconstruction would start with clearing unstable structures and restoring basic services before long-term redevelopment begins.</p><p>Trump also said a new governing body known as the "Board of Peace" would be formed soon, with international leaders seeking to take part. He mentioned Tony Blair as a potential participant but said he wanted to ensure the former British prime minister would be an "acceptable choice."</p><p>Trump acknowledged that Hamas has begun forming a local police force and said the U.S. granted temporary approval for that effort to help maintain order. He estimated that Hamas had lost "probably 60,000 people" in the conflict and said ensuring safety as civilians return was now a priority.</p><p>He praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as "the right person at this time," revealing that Netanyahu had nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump said Netanyahu "did a very good job" during the conflict and that their relationship remained strong.</p><p>Trump also told reporters the peace deal between Israel and Hamas is the eighth war he has solved, adding that he heard there is a war going on between Pakistan and Afghanistan, now.</p><p>"I said I’ll have to wait til I get back. I’m doing another one because I’m good at solving wars. I’m good at making peace. And, it’s an honor to do it," he said. "I saved millions of lives – millions of lives."</p><p>Earlier on Sunday, Vice President JD Vance warned that some of the hostages who were killed while in captivity by Hamas may never be returned to their families.</p><p>"The reality is that some of the hostages may never get back, but I do think, with some effort, we'll be able to give them to their families so they at least have some closure," Vance said on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures."</p><p>He continued, noting that while rescuing living hostages remains the Trump administration’s top priority, returning the remains of those killed is also an important effort to give families closure.</p><p>"We do want to give these people the ability to have a proper burial with their loved ones who were murdered by brutal terrorists, and that matters to us," Vance said. "It matters to the families, and it will remain a focus, but it's going to take some time."</p><p>The vice president stopped short of certainly, though, saying he believes most of the victims’ remains – but not all – will eventually be recovered.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Taylor Penley contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Charlie Sheen is getting real about what it was like having a brother who was a member of the infamous Brat Pack.</p><p>During an appearance on Conan O'Brien's podcast, "Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend," on Oct. 6, Sheen discussed how he felt when his brother, Emilio Estevez, was at the height of his fame as a member of the Brat Pack, while he hadn't had his breakthrough in the industry yet.</p><p>"It felt awful," Sheen said. "I felt like I was just taking up the rear. I felt like a valet on certain nights."</p><p>The Brat Pack was a group of young actors in the 1980s who frequently appeared in films together. It included big celebrities, such as Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Andrew McCarthy, Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy.</p><p>After appearing in some of the biggest movies of the decade, including "The Breakfast Club," "The Outsiders" and "Sixteen Candles," the pack started getting more and more attention. Sheen said that while he "was in the mix" and hanging out with his brother and the other actors at "all the VIP lounges and all the special places," he still felt out of place. </p><p>"It felt the worst… when [they got] all the attention from all the pretty girls… and they would all go home with them, and I would just go home," Sheen said. "I think there's a line in [my new] book that my inner bear had been poked, and it lit a fire, and you could see it from the f---ing moon."</p><p>He went on to explain that he "didn't give a s--- about acting" and that his jealousy never stemmed from his desire to act, but that he wasn't "part of all of the perks" his brother was getting. </p><p>Sheen previously opened up about what it was like being in the shadows of his older brother in that time period, saying "I felt so small and left out as I watched the Emilio-steered throng." He later added that being out with them and a "bevy of gorgeous gals was like being shipwrecked with a fat guy – you're gonna starve."</p><p>In addition to his roles in "Platoon" and the hit sitcom, "Two and a Half Men," Sheen has made headlines throughout his career for his struggles with drugs and alcohol, which began in the 80s and 90s. After multiple stints in rehab, the actor got sober in 2017.</p><p>"There really aren’t challenges with sobriety," he told Fox News Digital in September. "I’m not connected to the people of the past… If I were to go back to those choices to numb myself, get out of my head, or feel differently, I have so much evidence that it’s only going to make things worse and more complicated. I’d suddenly be steeped in shame. And with that comes deceit and manipulation. All that c--- doesn’t fit in anymore."</p><p>When speaking about his decision to get sober, he explained that he "finally decided that I was going to make AA a place that I passed through and not wound up in" which made him feel as if he was "the captain of my own ship."</p><p>In the Netflix documentary "aka Charlie Sheen," the actor spoke about his first intervention, explaining he thought he was going to his father's birthday party but walked into a room full of his friends and family, who read him letters about how they feel. He recalled trying to think of ways to get out of going to treatment when his dad handed him the phone with Clint Eastwood on the other end of the line.</p><p>"[Clint] said something like, ‘You’ve got to get the train back on the tracks, kid … You’re worth saving,'" he said. "It was really powerful. I thanked him, gave the phone back to Dad and said, 'All right, let’s go.'"</p><p>Sheen finally got clean in 2017. "You have to be willing," he told People magazine. "I keep a [mental list] of the worst, most shameful things I’ve done, and I can look at that in my head if I feel like having a drink."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Vance says Pritzker should 'face some consequences' for Chicago crime rate</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Vice President J.D. Vance slammed Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Sunday, saying he should "suffer some consequences" for his handling of Chicago’s high crime rate. </p><p>"I think that Governor Pritzker has allowed a lot of people to be killed in the city of Chicago and elsewhere," Vance told ABC’s "This Week" host George Stephanopoulos during a testy exchange. "I think it's disgraceful, and I think he absolutely should suffer some consequences for the fact that there are thousands of innocent Chicagoans who are dead because he failed to do his job." </p><p>Stephanopoulos, a former Clinton administration official, pressed Vance on whether he agreed with President Donald Trump that Pritzker had committed a crime. Trump had posted that Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson should be imprisoned for failing to protect ICE officers. </p><p>Trump accused the elected officials of failing to protect ICE officers, and said that the actions amounted to criminal activity during remarks to the press at the White House. He made the remarks in response to a question about whether he would direct the Justice Department to look into charging Johnson and Pritzker.</p><p>"I’ve seen the law. And when you have a group of people where the police call off the safety for ICE officials, I’ve understood that, and I’ve read it today in numerous journals, that that’s illegal," Trump said.</p><p>Trump later doubled down on his comments in a Truth Social post. </p><p>"Chicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers! Governor Pritzker also!" Trump posted on Truth Social Wednesday.</p><p>During "This Week" on Sunday, Stephanopoulos pressed the vice president over whether he agreed with Trump that Pritzker had committed a crime. Vance sidestepped the question multiple times, but criticized the Illinois governor for failing to address Chicago’s crime crisis.</p><p><i>"</i>I think Governor Pritzker has certainly failed to keep the people of Illinois safe. And it's interesting to me, you know, Governor Pritzker will talk a lot, I'm sure, about how bad Donald Trump is, about how bad I am, and about how the administration is. He is the governor of a state. That where its biggest city has murder rates that rival the most violent places in the third world," Vance said. </p><p>There were 591 homicides in Chicago in 2024, according to CPD data. Chicago had the highest number of homicides of any U.S. city in 2024, according to the FBI. Overall crime in Chicago was down 11 % from the previous year.</p><p>Trump deployed 200 National Guard troops to Chicago Monday, against the wishes of Pritzker and Johnson. Three hundred Illinois National Guard troops have also been activated. ICE agents have clashed with protesters in recent weeks as they attempt to conduct immigration raids in the city. </p><p>An Illinois District Court judge blocked the deployment of National Guard troops Friday, but on Saturday a Federal Appeals court said they could remain in the Chicago area so long as they’re not deployed. </p><p>Vance called on Pritzker to stop blocking the National Guard in his state. </p><p>"He should be mad at the criminals that he has failed to keep at bay. We're trying to help him, and we're trying help the residents of his biggest city. I wish that he would let us, because he certainly isn't doing the job himself," Vance told Stephanopoulos. </p><p>Pritzker, immediately following Vance on "This Week," accused the vice president of uttering a "tidal wave of lies" during his appearance. </p><p>"You heard, just over and over again, him just making things up on national television with you," Pritzker said.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">5 hospitalized after helicopter crashes in busy oceanfront area of Huntington Beach</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Five people, including a child, were hospitalized when a helicopter crashed in the Southern California city of Huntington Beach on Saturday afternoon. </p><p>It happened just after 2 p.m. local time near a parking lot off Pacific Coast Highway, between Beach Boulevard and Twin Dolphins Drive, according to Huntington Beach firefighters. </p><p>City officials tell CBS News that the two people on the helicopter were safely pulled from the wreckage. Three pedestrians on the street were also injured in the incident, and all five people were taken to the hospital for treatment. None of their conditions was known.</p>
<p>Police closed PCH between Huntington Street and Beach Boulevard at around 3 p.m., as they began to investigate the crash. They asked people to avoid the area and use alternate routes for at least several hours after the closure was put into place. </p><p>A dramatic video posted on social media shows the helicopter spinning several times before crashing into palm trees and the outdoor stairway of the pedestrian bridge that runs over PCH to the Hyatt Regency Huntington Beach Resort and Spa. </p><p>Other video footage shows an object falling from the helicopter moments before it plummeted from the sky. </p>
<p>With SkyCal over the scene, scattered debris was seen in the beach access parking lot, a large part of which was blocked off by police tape. The tail of the aircraft broke off in the crash, with the rest of the helicopter still wedged between the staircase and palm trees as of 4:30 p.m.</p><p>There were several other small helicopters parked in the parking lot near where the crash happened, just in front of the Hyatt Regency and Waterfront Beach Resort. An "exclusive helicopter landing party" was being hosted by MD Helicopters at the Offshore 9 Rooftop Lounge on Saturday afternoon, where attendees were invited to "watch helicopters arrive from a bird's eye view." The landing party was scheduled ahead of the Cars 'N Copters On the Coast main event on Sunday.</p><p>Event organizers said that the event was not going to be canceled. </p><p>"We are sending our prayers out to all involved in the unfortunate incident today," said a statement. "Our plan for now is to move forward with our event tomorrow, Sunday, October 12th. We will advise everyone at the earliest possible opportunity if that plan changes."</p>
<p>Witnesses said that the helicopter appeared to dip towards the bridge before it lost control and crashed. </p><p>"You can hear this odd sound that didn't sound right," said Kevin Bullat, who saw the scene unfold. "I looked out and I see the helicopter spiraling out of control. ... My friend saw shrapnel, or just debris, catapulting across PCH."</p><p>It's unclear what caused the helicopter to crash. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have been notified of the crash, city officials said. They believe that an investigation report will be ready within 30 days. </p><p>The helicopter was a Bell 222, which is powered by two turboshaft engines, and was manufactured in 1980. Though officials haven't yet identified any of the victims, CBS News Los Angeles has learned that the helicopter was registered to a man named Eric Nixon. </p><p>An Instagram account named Nixon Helicopters posted to say that both the pilot and passenger were safe and hospitalized following the crash. Other friends of Nixon's also posted on social media, claiming that he broke some ribs and fractured his spine. </p>

<p>Two victims were pronounced dead on the scene. The victims have not been identified.  </p><p>"We ran out here and there was smoke, it was black, but what was bad was the fire.

<div class="article-title">Alaska hit by severe flooding that carries away homes</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The remnants of Typhoon Halong brought hurricane-force winds and catastrophic flooding to coastal communities in western Alaska on Sunday, pushing entire houses off their foundations.  </p><p>Rescue aircraft were dispatched to the tiny Alaskan villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, where there were reports of up to 20 people possibly unaccounted for, said Jeremy Zidek, spokesperson for the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.</p><p>"We have received reports that people's homes have floated away and that people were potentially in those homes," Zidek told The Associated Press.</p><p>Alaska State Troopers said both Kipnuk and Kwigillingok were hit by "strong winds and heavy flooding overnight, which caused significant damage, including at least eight homes being pushed from their foundations."</p><p>In Kwigillingok, at least 18 people were rescued, while at least 16 people were rescued in Kipnuk, Alaska State Troopers said Sunday night local time. Three people were still unaccounted for in Kwigillingok as of 6:50 p.m. local time. Troopers had also received reports of people still unaccounted for in Kipnuk, but could not confirm the exact number.</p>
<p>More than a dozen agencies are involved in the disaster response, CBS affiliate KXDF-TV reported, including the Alaska National Guard. </p><p>"The Alaska Organized Militia, which includes the Alaska National Guard, Alaska State Defense Force, and Alaska Naval Militia, has been requested to activate up to 60 members to assist with storm response operations across affected western Alaska communities," the National Guard wrote Saturday.</p><h2>Alaska governor: "Help is on the way"</h2><p>More than 170 people stayed overnight at a community shelter in Kipnuk, where the water rose overnight 6.6 feet above the highest tide. At least eight homes were swept away, Zidek said.</p><p>Roads and boardwalks were inundated and power lines were damaged in Bethel, Napaskiak, Napakiak, and other Yukon-Kuskokwim communities. Crews worked to clear the airport runway in Bethel, which was littered with debris from high winds. The area is among one of the most isolated in the U.S., where some communities have few roads and residents use boardwalks, boats and snowmobiles to get around, Zidek said.</p>
<p>"Every effort will be made to help those hit by this storm. Help is on the way," Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a statement.</p><p>Dunleavy also said he has expanded the state's disaster declaration to include areas impacted by the storm.

<div class="article-title">The similarities between today's market and Wall Street before 1929 crash</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>After nearly a decade spent studying the most famous stock market crash in history, financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin warns that the Wall Street of today echoes the market of 1929, when highs preceded a massive slump, leading to the Great Depression.</p><p>Artificial intelligence and technology have contributed to a remarkable boom in recent years. But, Sorkin said, today's economy is being propped up by the AI boom, and it's too soon to tell if this is a sugar rush, a short-term and unsustainable boost to the markets. But, Sorkin is positive there's a crash coming.</p><p>"I just can't tell you when, and I can't tell you how deep," he said. "But I can assure you, unfortunately, I wish I wasn't saying this, we will have a crash."</p><h2>The Roaring '20s</h2><p>Despite a tumble this Friday, stocks on Wall Street have shot up in recent months. Still, some investors are getting weak in the knees, fearing stocks are overheated. Sorkin, author of "1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History – and How It Shattered a Nation," out Oct. 14, says the U.S. is in a new roaring 20s, the 2020s, with stocks pushing to record highs, just as they were in the 1920s. </p><p>Market highs today have him feeling anxious.</p>
<p>"I'm anxious that we are at prices that may not feel sustainable. And what I don't know is we are either living through some kind of remarkable boom and part of that's artificial intelligence and technology, and all of that, or everything's overpriced," he said. </p>
<p>The market of 1929 was fueled by rampant speculation, including by ordinary investors unaware of the mounting risks, and of heavy borrowing. People of modest means were lured by Wall Street bankers and other stock market touts to invest using what was then a newfangled concept: credit. It was called buying on a margin. You only had to put down 10% of the stock price, borrowing the rest from your banker. </p><p>Before 1919, most people did not take on credit or debt, influenced by religious views and moral norms against borrowing money, Sorkin said. That changed when General Motors, in 1919, started lending people money so they could afford to buy the company's cars. It changed out Americans shopped.</p><p>"And then the bankers realize what's happening, and they realize that they can lend out money so that more folks can buy stocks. It was all sort of wrapped in the flag of democratizing access," Sorkin said. "And in good times, when the stock is going up, it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook, and you're on the hook in a very bad way."</p>
<p>Today, it's hundreds of billions being invested in AI, with some investment pros warning of a possible bubble as stocks soar to stratospheric heights even amid significant economic uncertainty, such as Friday's slide after President Trump  threatened more China tariffs.</p><p>"I think it's hard to say we're not in a bubble of some sort," Sorkin said. "The question is always when is the bubble going to pop?"</p><h2>Protecting consumers in the market</h2><p>When things got out of control in 1929, frightened traders dumped stocks as investors lost their businesses and homes. In the years since, laws, regulations and agencies have been put in place to protect investors.</p><p>Some of those barriers to prevent exploitation are now coming down, Sorkin said. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules have become less stringent and "the Consumer Protection Bureau practically doesn't exist anymore."</p><p>"That's what concerns me," Sorkin said. "It's not that we're going off a cliff tomorrow. It's that there's speculation in the market today, there's an increasing amount of debt in the market today, and all of that's happening against the backdrop of the guardrails coming off."</p><p>Those guardrails include ones that allow only the wealthy to invest directly in private companies that have fewer regulations, like AI startups before they go public.</p><p>In recent decades, people who could invest in private equity and venture capital outperformed investors who did not. Those kinds of assets, generally restricted to wealthy investors, are potentially more rewarding, but also riskier.</p>
<p>"Public companies, after the SEC was created, were required to have all sorts of disclosure rules so that the public could understand what's going on inside them. Private companies don't have that," Sorkin said. "But historically, the average ordinary American wasn't really allowed to invest in the private companies. But in this flag of democratizing finance, there's a lot of people who want access to that."</p><p>Some people feel elite investors have better access, while others are unable to get in early on opportunities, Sorkin said. There's been a push by both the Trump administration and the financial sector to open up the market to more people.</p><p>But that would also require moving the guardrails designed to protect people. </p><p>"They have protected a lot of people, but some people would say they protected people from getting rich," Sorkin said. </p><h2>Push today for democratizing investing </h2><p>In his latest annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested opening retirement 401(k)s to riskier private investments in the name of democratizing investing. He said there were opportunities for investing in AI or data centers. </p><p>Right now money managers are precluded from investing in those types of assets in many retirement products, but the Trump administration is in the process of changing that, Fink explained. </p><p>The new investment opportunity comes with risk. </p>
<p>"But everything is risky other than keeping your money in a bank account overnight," Fink said.</p>
<p>Fink, who once called bitcoin the domain of money launderers and thieves, also wants to add crypto to investment portfolios.</p><p>"The markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions," he said. "There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold — that is, it's an alternative."</p><p>He sees it, as he does AI, as an opportunity to add diversity to a portfolio.</p><p>But Sorkin says some crypto products, like meme coins, can be abused in ways similar to 1929, with speculators sending the value of cryptocurrencies soaring before they come crashing down. Sorkin has his own personal example involving a television appearance with Fink. </p><p>"He makes a joke, I think, about how there should be a Sorkin coin. Well, two hours later, somebody makes a Sorkin coin. And all of a sudden, this Sorkin coin is now worth millions of dollars. And I'm watching it," Sorkin said.</p><p>The Sorkin coin peaked at $170 million worth of trading in a day. </p>
<p>"And I think today it does something like $20 or $21 a day," Sorkin said. </p>

<div class="article-title">Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on his hopes for rebuilding</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The <span class="link">deal</span> brokered by the Trump administration between Israel and Hamas raises hope not only for an end to the war in Gaza but for a broader transformation of the Middle East. And in some ways, that's been happening already. Israel's massive response in the two years since the October 7th terrorist attacks included decimating the powerful Iran-backed militia Hezbollah, which helped prop up the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who bombed and used chemical weapons against his own people. With Hezbollah weakened, Syrian rebels set out on the road to Damascus to overthrow the brutal Assad regime. In December, the rebel commander, 42-year-old Ahmed al-Sharaa, proclaimed a new and free Syria — a stunning turn because the country's liberator had once been a member of al Qaeda. Tonight, you'll hear his first U.S. television interview since becoming president. But before we sat down in the presidential palace, there was something he wanted us to see. </p><p>This is Jobar, on the outskirts of Damascus. Three hundred thousand people once lived here. Syria's new President Ahmed al-Sharaa brought us here last month.</p><p>Margaret Brennan: It's shocking. It's-- there's just nothing left.</p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): This war was cruel. It was a hard war. Every single room in any one of these buildings holds memories for those people who lived here<strong>.</strong></p><p>Margaret Brennan: This wasn't a mistake. This was a target.</p>
<p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): Of course. All these were direct targets with one objective: To displace the people in these areas.</p><p>About 13 million Syrians, half the population, are internally displaced or living abroad as refugees. Over half a million died during nearly 14 years of civil war. There are places like this throughout Syria, where even mosques were bombed, al-Sharaa told us – rebel-held areas that were destroyed by Bashar al-Assad and his allies, Russia and Iran.</p>
<p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): There are entire generations that have suffered tremendous psychological trauma. So, it's very important that the period of liberation, give people new hope for their return and for reconstruction.</p><p>Margaret Brennan: You're a father of young children. Do you think this will be rebuilt in their lifetime?</p>
<p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): For sure. The Syrian people are strong. </p><p>When al-Sharaa's Islamist forces launched a surprise attack on the city of Aleppo in November 2024, they not only won, they kept going</p><p>By the time they got to Damascus, the capital, the dictator <span class="link">Bashar al-Assad had fled to Moscow</span>.</p><p>Al-Sharaa's forces ended <span class="link">54 years of the Assad family's tyrannical rule</span> in just 11 days.</p><p>In January, leaders of the militias that <span class="link">overthrew the regime</span> appointed al-Sharaa president of Syria. We spoke with him in the cavernous building that Bashar al-Sssad once occupied.</p><p>Margaret Brennan: What was it like when you first entered this place?</p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): Entering this palace wasn't a very positive experience. Much evil towards the Syrian people came out of this palace<strong>, </strong>since it was built<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>To understand his improbable path to the presidency, you have to go back about 20 years when al-Sharaa left an upper-middle-class life in Syria to join al Qaeda in Iraq. He wouldn't go into details about what he did then, but he was arrested and spent six years in American and Iraqi prisons. Released in 2011, just as a popular uprising against Bashar al-Assad had begun, he started an al Qaeda affiliate in Syria that staged suicide bombings and armed attacks against the Assad regime.</p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): We did not take any external actions outside Syrian territory. We did not target anyone but the Syrian regime.</p><p>But the United States stated that many of the attacks killed quote "innocent Syrian civilians," and designated al-Sharaa a global terrorist, putting him – with his nom de guerre – on this wanted poster and offering a $10 million reward to anyone who could help, quote, "stop this terrorist."</p><p>Margaret Brennan: Have you ever seen that poster, the wanted poster?</p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): Yes, of course.</p>
<p>Margaret Brennan: When you <span class="link">met President Trump</span> back in May, he described you as handsome. Tough. And he said you had a strong past.</p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): Have you any doubt about that?</p>
<p>Margaret Brennan: I-- I don't have doubt-- any doubt about your strong past. But-- it-- it's because of that past that you were designated as a terrorist by the American government.<strong> //</strong>there was that $10 million bounty on your head until just-- a few months ago.</p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): It would have been a waste. It would have been money ill- spent. We are talking about 25 years ago. I was 17 or 18 years old. The level of awareness that you have now is different from what it was 20 years ago.</p><p>He eventually broke ties with a former ally - the founder of the terror group ISIS; and, in 2016, renounced his allegiance to al Qaeda.</p><p>Margaret Brennan: Did you actually believe in those terror groups then, or were they just a means to an end?</p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): If I had agreed with them, I would not have left them. </p><p>Margaret Brennan: Many of the officials that I spoke to about you describe you as a pragmatist. Other skeptics say that you change to meet what you need to be in that moment. And that's important, to understand who you are and the direction you're taking Syria in. Are you saying that you are just a completely changed man?</p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): I don't entirely agree with the description of pragmatist because in Arabic it has some negative connotations. The point is let's look at what's happening now….. regardless of what was said in the media. Today, we have really saved the people from the oppression that was being thrust on them by the criminal regime. </p>
<p>Ten months after the fall of the Assad regime, we found signs of normalcy and difficulty, uncertainty and hope. In Damascus, one of the world's oldest cities, the bazaar still bustles, and the faithful still come to pray at the Umayyad Mosque, as they have for 13 centuries.</p><p>One of the only places you'll still see Bashar al-Assad's face is on Syria's highly devalued currency. you need a brick of it to buy dinner.</p><p>Many Syrians have electricity and running water for just a few hours a day.</p><p>The country's woes are the result of the long civil war, but also harsh economic sanctions the U.S. and other countries imposed to punish Assad for his human rights abuses. Al-Shaara wants all sanctions lifted, and in May, during a speech in Saudi Arabia, President Trump took a bold but provisional step in that direction.</p><p><em>President Trump: I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness.</em></p><p>Last month, al-Sharaa spoke at the United Nations General Assembly – the first Syrian leader to do so since 1967. He's seeking long-term investment in Syria, and still needs the U.S. to repeal sanctions permanently, which some lawmakers are reluctant to do. And at the U.N., China and Russia would need to vote to lift terrorism sanctions against him.</p><p>Al-Sharaa personally welcomed a high-level delegation from Moscow last month – a remarkable development given the Russian air force helped Bashar al-Assad pummel places like Jobar.</p>
<p>Margaret Brennan: There are millions of Syrians living in tents because things like this happened to them. Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin are living in Moscow. What justice do they face?</p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation):We will use all legal means possible to demand that Bashar al-Assad be brought to justice. However, engaging in a conflict with Russia right now would be too costly for Syria. Nor would it be in the country's interest.</p><p>New sectarian violence at home has raised questions about whether al-Sharaa can control the fighters who helped bring him to power. On Syria's western coast in March, his security forces and allied militia were accused of participating in the massacre of 1,500 civilians, most of them members of the Alawite community that was loyal to Assad. </p><p>Margaret Brennan: The United Nations does say that your security forces violated humanitarian law.</p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): I believe this is an exaggerated description. And I believe that Syria is committed to prosecuting anyone who committed crimes against civilians, of any party or side.</p>
<p>But then again, this summer, during a fight between ethnic groups, al-Sharaa's security forces and Bedouin militia were accused of executing unarmed members of the minority Druze community in the southern city of Sweida.</p><p>A Syrian TV broadcaster was reading the news when Israel, which also has Druze citizens, bombed Syria's army headquarters and Defense Ministry.</p>
<p>Al-Shaara told us Israel also bombed the grounds of his presidential palace twice.</p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): One time I wasn't there, but the other time I was in the palace close to the site that was bombed. To target the palace to convey a message, that's not a message, that's a declaration of war. But Syria doesn't want to engage in wars, and it doesn't want to be a threat to Israel or anyone else. </p><p>Margaret Brennan: Israel said publicly their intention was to protect a minority group there, the Druze. And the Prime Minister said he had to protect them, because your forces did not. </p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation). This is a Syrian internal matter that should be resolved legally by Syrian authorities. </p><p>After Assad fell, Israel occupied strategic parts of its shared border with Syria and conducted air raids and land incursions citing potential security threats. President Trump's Special Envoy to Syria Tom Barrack has been trying to broker an agreement that would ease tensions.</p><p>Margaret Brennan: Your government has been discussing a security agreement with Israel. Does that for you mean that Israel has to return all of the land that it-- it seized after the Assad regime fell? </p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): During negotiations, yes for sure. Israel must retreat from any point taken after December 8th. Syria has not provoked Israel since we arrived in Damascus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this past week, parliamentary elections were held in much of Syria, but only a limited number of people were eligible to vote. Under an interim constitution al-Sharaa signed in March, he's supposed to serve as president for five years, leading a transition to elected government. </p><p>Margaret Brennan: What kind of government do you wanna see here? Is it a democracy?</p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): General elections will be held once the infrastructure is rebuilt, and once the population has IDs and proper documents.</p><p>Margaret Brennan: So eventually, you want Syria to be a place where every person gets one vote?</p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): Absolutely. </p><p>If al-Sharaa can follow through on his promises, it would be a new day for Syria, and for the Middle East. But as we saw, major challenges lie ahead. In Jobar, al-Sharaa told us it will cost $600 to 900 billion to rebuild his country, and that's going to require the international community's help.</p><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa (in Arabic/English Translation): The world watched this tragedy unfold for 14 years and couldn't do anything to stop this massive crime. So, the world today should provide support to Syria. Anyone who obstructs the lifting of sanctions on Syria is an accomplice to those who committed this crime.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>At home and abroad, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who once led an affiliate of al Qaeda and was designated as a terrorist by the U.S. in 2013, is facing questions over whether he can stabilize, unify and democratize a <span class="link">fractured and traumatized Syria</span>.</p><p>He is encountering major challenges, including rebuilding devastated communities, protecting minorities from persecution, and getting oppressive economic sanctions permanently lifted. If al-Sharaa can follow through on his promises, it would be a new day for Syria and for the Middle East.</p><p>"Syria deserves to live in peace and security, and the world will benefit from Syria's new situation," al-Sharaa said. "It is a great historical opportunity for the region."</p><h2>Ahmed al-Sharaa's path from al Qaeda to president of Syria </h2><p>About 20 years ago, al-Sharaa left an upper-middle-class life in Syria to join al Qaeda in Iraq . He wouldn't elaborate on what he did during his time in Iraq but he was arrested in 2005 and spent six years in American and Iraqi prisons.</p><p>Al-Sharaa was released from prison in 2011, just as a popular uprising against the dictator and then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had begun. He started an al Qaeda affiliate in Syria that staged suicide bombings and armed attacks against the Assad regime. </p>
<p>"We did not take any external actions outside Syrian territory. We did not target anyone but the Syrian regime," al-Sharaa said. </p>
<p>But the U.S. stated that many of the attacks killed "innocent Syrian civilians." The U.S. designated al-Sharaa a global terrorist and put his face, with the assumed name he was using at the time — Abu Mohammad al-Jolani — on a wanted poster. A $10 million reward was offered to anyone who could help "stop this terrorist."</p><p>He eventually broke ties with a former ally, the founder of the terror group ISIS, and in 2016, al-Sharaa renounced his allegiance to al Qaeda. </p><p>"If I had agreed with them, I would not have left them," he said.</p>
<p>In November 2024, al-Sharaa's Islamist forces launched a surprise attack on Aleppo. They took the ancient city, and kept going. By the time they <span class="link">got to the capital, Damascus</span>, Assad had <span class="link">fled to Moscow</span>. </p><p>Al-Sharaa's forces ended <span class="link">54 years of the Assad family's tyrannical rule</span> in just 11 days. </p><p>In December, al-Shaara proclaimed a new and free Syria. Leaders of the militias that toppled Assad appointed him as president of Syria the following month.</p><p>60 Minutes sat down with al-Sharaa for his first American television interview since becoming president.</p><p>"Entering this palace wasn't a very positive experience," al-Sharaa said of his first time walking into the presidential palace once occupied by Assad. "Much evil towards the Syrian people came out of this palace."</p><h2>Rebuilding Syria </h2><p>Today, about 13 million Syrians, half the country's population, are internally displaced or living abroad as refugees. Over half a million people died during nearly 14 years of civil war from 2011 to 2024. </p><p>Rebel-held areas were destroyed by Assad and his allies, Russia and Iran. </p>
<p>"There are entire generations that have suffered tremendous psychological trauma," al-Sharaa said.</p>
<p>Syria's new president said it's important to give people hope for rebuilding and returning to their homes. Standing in the destroyed community of Jobar, on the outskirts of Damascus, al-Sharaa, who has young children, said he believes the area will be rebuilt in their lifetimes. </p><p>"The Syrian people are strong," al-Sharaa said. </p><p>Ten months after the fall of the Assad regime, 60 Minutes saw signs of normalcy and difficulty, uncertainty and hope. In Damascus, one of the world's oldest cities, the bazaar still bustles, and the faithful still come to pray at the Umayyad mosque, as they have for 13 centuries.</p><p>Bashar Assad's face is still on Syria's highly devalued currency — a brick of it is needed to buy dinner.</p><p>Many Syrians have electricity and running water for just a few hours a day.</p><p>Al-Sharaa said it will cost $600-900 billion to rebuild his country, and that's going to require the international community's help.</p>

Al-Sharaa said he still intends to use legal means to pursue justice against Assad, who is living in Moscow since fleeing Syria. In September, a Syrian judge issued a warrant for Assad's arrest.</p>

<div class="article-title">Inside Syria's notorious Sednaya prison</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>When Mutassim Abdulsatir arrived at Syria's Sednaya prison, accused of so-called state terrorism activities, he stepped into a world of terrifying violence.</p><p>"We would lie flat on our bellies like this," he said as he spread his arms over a dirt-floor room.</p><p>"We'd get hit with pipes over and over again… until some of us died," he told Margaret Brennan, on assignment for a 60 Minutes interview with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa. </p><p>Abdulsatir was then brought to a dark basement, where he and seven other prisoners huddled in a cell the size of a small bathroom. Abdulsatir said he was locked in there for three months. </p><p>He said he watched the guards beat several people to death in his cell. He remembers their names. </p>
<p>"Ahmad Khalid Taree, Samer Abdelrazzak Obaid, Abdulaziz al-Swaid," he told Brennan in the cramped cell.</p><p>"Every day, there was a death. It's as if this prison had a policy… as if the guards were required or programmed to kill someone every day."</p><p>Brennan told 60 Minutes Overtime that walking through the prison with someone who survived it was an emotional experience for her and the 60 Minutes team. </p><p>"He was reliving the entire experience for us in front of our cameras. It was very powerful," she told Overtime. </p>
<p>"Sednaya Prison was a tool of the Assad regime's repression. And we know this not just from prisoners themselves who came out... [but] by human rights groups, by people who really did try to build the case to show the world that there were ongoing human rights abuses being carried out in a really industrialized way by the Assad family," Brennan said.</p><p>Human rights organizations have documented execution, torture, beatings, starvation, and deprivation of medicine and medical care within Sednaya's walls. </p><p>In 2017, Amnesty International reported on a program of mass execution at the prison during Syria's civil war. They estimated thousands of Sednaya prisoners had been executed by hanging between September 2011 and December 2015. </p><p>The report also found that guards had deprived prisoners of food, water, medicine and medical care. Many prisoners watched their cellmates die of starvation, exhaustion, or treatable illness. </p><p>"Executions, torture, starvation— it's all deliberate," Brennan told Overtime.</p><p>After his harrowing detainment in the basement, Abdulsatir was transferred to a larger cell in what looks like a more traditional prison cell block. </p><p>As the 60 Minutes team arrived at the place he called "home," Brennan noticed that Abdulsatir's demeanor changed. </p>
<p>"As hard as it was to come back, sometimes he remembers good things, like the friendships he had," Brennan told Overtime. </p><p>"It's like I'm visiting my family… I have some painful memories, but I also have some beautiful memories with my friends," he told Brennan standing outside of his former cell. "I feel that they are still with me."</p><p>Abdulsatir told 60 Minutes that speaking was forbidden inside Sednaya's cells. Prisoners could only speak in whispers. If they were caught speaking, they would be beaten. </p><p>"One of the things that was or will remain burnt into my memory is him describing what it was like just to be fed," Brennan told Overtime. </p><p>"When the guards would bring the food, sometimes they would just take the yogurt, and throw it against the wall, and say, 'Lick it.' That was his protein."</p><p>At one point, Abdulsatir said, the pipe that supplied water to the cell was shut off for six days. He said he began to hallucinate, imagining that the water had been turned back on and that he was eating a meal with his family. </p><p>"He also described what it was like at night when the guards would come by and say, 'Who's died?'" Brennan told 60 Minutes Overtime. </p>
<p>"They tell us, for example: 'who died next to you?' 'Abdulaziz died next to me.' The guard says, 'Sleep next to Abdulaziz. In the morning, you'll need to write down his number here,'" he explained to Brennan while indicating the number was written on the forehead. </p><p>Abdulsatir's description of identifying bodies by writing a sequence of numbers separated by a slash on the forehead sounds identical to a known method of categorizing bodies killed at the hands of Syria's Air Force intelligence branch that was exposed by a former military photographer and whistleblower known as "<span class="link">Caesar</span>." </p><p>Suddenly, as arbitrarily as he was detained, Abdulsatir was one day released. </p><p>"When they called my name, I [thought I] was going to die. I thought I was going to die or be executed. He told me, 'You're being released! You have received a verdict of not guilty!'"</p><p>Abdulsatir showed 60 Minutes a document that he says he was given, declaring him not guilty of state terrorism charges and ordering his release from Sednaya. </p><p>"It would've been easier if they had killed me. As much as you're happy to get out and see your family, you cry for your companions with whom you shared memories," he told Brennan.</p><p>The Syrian Commission on Missing Persons, established by the transitional government in Syria, estimates that between 120,000 and 300,000 people are still missing. </p>
<p>According to reports by the Association of Detainees and Missing Persons in Seydnayah Prison, where Abdulsatir now works, the bodies of those who were executed at Sednaya were dumped into a mass grave in the nearby Najha cemetery.</p><p>Human rights groups believe there are dozens more mass grave sites, and efforts to identify more are under way. </p><p>An independent group established by the United Nations called the Independent Institution on Missing Persons in the Syrian Arab Republic hopes to clarify the fate and whereabouts of all missing persons in Syria, and assist in the investigation of mass grave sites.</p><p>"What should happen to the people who beat you, who kept you here in this prison?" Brennan asked Abdulsatir, standing outside of his cell. </p><p>"We don't want to see them go through what happened to us, because what happened to us would not be acceptable even for animals. We want a fair trial… where a guard would be asked who gave him the orders to kill prisoners by hanging them, or who gave him orders to shut the water off for six days," he told Brennan.</p><p>"We would like to know what that chain of command looked like and who was part of it."</p><p>Abdulsatir thinks Sednaya prison should be turned into a museum, and a memorial to those who were imprisoned and died here.</p>
<p>"This is the least we could do for the Sednaya prisoners, because they're the ones who led us to freedom."</p><p><em>The video above was produced by Will Croxton.

<p>Retired four-star Gen. Tim Haugh, who was <span class="link">fired</span> from his role as head of both the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command in April, said he is still focused on "our nation's security" at the end of the day. </p><p>Haugh was promoted to a two-star general, then earned a third star during the first Trump administration. He rose to lead the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command in 2024 and led it for a little over a year. </p><p>Haugh was fired in April of this year after far-right activist Laura Loomer met with President Trump. Online she explained that Haugh was "disloyal" and had been "referred for firing." Evidence she pointed to, publicly, was Haugh's appointment by President Biden. She called Haugh's firing "a blessing for the American people."</p><p>Haugh, in his first television interview since retirement, said he was "absolutely not" disloyal, and that he'd gotten up every day "committed to our national security and to meeting the expectations of the president."</p><p>"I know in my heart that every day I wanted to achieve the things for our nation that would make us more secure and make every American safe, and that continued till my last day of service," Haugh said. "So from that perspective, it certainly was impactful to me and my family. But at the end of the day, it's about our nation and it's about our nation's security."</p>

<div class="article-title">China hacking critical infrastructure in the U.S.</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Until recently, Tim Haugh was among America's top spymasters. The four-star general spent 33 years in Air Force Intelligence and rose to lead America's largest and most advanced intelligence agency. Haugh was also in charge of defending America from computer threats. In his first television interview since retirement, General Haugh is here to warn that <span class="link">China</span> has hacked into U.S. computer networks to an astonishing degree. And he believes he knows why. The surprise, Tim Haugh told us, is that China is targeting not just the U.S. military and industry but also Americans in their homes.</p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: I think initially we were surprised that China would target every American with these capabilities. That goes against every norm of international law. That certainly goes against how the United States military would approach targeting in a crisis or a conflict. That the fact that they would go after basic services as part of their effort that they have identified as unrestricted warfare is unconscionable.</p><p>Scott Pelley: And what did they target?</p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: They targeted water. They targeted electrical power infrastructure; transportation are examples of the types of things that were targeted. And in many cases they're vulnerable.</p><p>Multiple intrusions at utilities were discovered in 2023. And China had been on some of their computer networks at least five years. </p>
<p>Scott Pelley: You're saying that the Chinese today are in American power plants, water treatment plants, other parts of the electrical grid, maybe even hospitals, telecommunications, all of that?</p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: So there is a daily contest that is going on to be able to deny China those accesses. But they are certainly attempting every single day to be able to target telecommunications, to be able to target critical infrastructure, both in the United States and in other countries. And they are doing that to try to ensure that they have an advantage in a crisis or a conflict.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Is China preparing for war?</p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: There was no other reason to target those systems. There's no advantage to be gained economically. There was no foreign intelligence-collection value. The only value would be for use in a crisis or a conflict.</p>
<p>In 2024, Tim Haugh rose to lead both the National Security Agency, America's largest spy agency, plus U.S. Cyber Command, the military defense in cyberspace. Haugh took over just as the scope of China's hacking of utilities was becoming clear in a place no one would have imagined. </p>
<p>Scott Pelley: Is Littleton a major supplier of some kind to the federal government?</p><p>Nick Lawler: We are not.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Major supplier to a military base?</p><p>Nick Lawler: Nope.</p><p>Nick Lawler is general manager of the Littleton, Massachusetts electric and water utility. His town has 10,000 residents. </p><p>Scott Pelley: Can you think of any reason that China would target your little community?</p><p>Nick Lawler: That's the exact question I had for the FBI when they visited me on that first day, and I still can't answer that question. No, I can't think of one reason.</p>
<p>The FBI visited in November 2023 to tell Lawler that China had access to his utility's computer network. He says the feds told him he was one of 200. </p><p>Scott Pelley: How much of all of this is controlled, remotely by computer?</p><p>Nick Lawler: All of it. </p><p>In his water treatment plant, Lawler showed us tanks of dangerous chemicals that are precisely controlled to deliver clean water. </p><p>Scott Pelley: If you had control of these tanks, you've got control of Littleton, Massachusetts. You can poison the water. </p><p>Nick Lawler: You can poison the water.</p><p>But China was caught before it had operational control. With Lawler's permission, the feds watched what China was doing and what they learned was part of an awakening for American security. </p>
<p>Gen. Tim Haugh: If you are willing to go after a small water provider in Littleton, Massachusetts, what other target is off the list? So, from that perspective, this is a national threat. It's one that needs to be addressed. But it's also one that every American should understand, because if they're willing to go after that small provider that doesn't have a national security connection, that means every target is on the list.</p><p>Scott Pelley: So help me understand, why Littleton?</p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: If we're involved in something in the Indo-Pacific that is-- becoming a challenge between the United States and China, the more that China could get us to focus at home means now our resources are focused in the homeland. That would distract us, distract resources, make it more difficult for us to mobilize in a crisis.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Littleton may not be a very large place, but if the Chinese took its water offline, the entire country would be focused on it.</p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: And if there were three to four other examples simultaneously plus an information campaign it could seem much larger than it is, or it could be done in critical places that would have a greater effect.</p><p>Other critical places believed to have been targeted by China over years include New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 13 gas pipeline operators, the port of Houston and major phone companies. </p><p>Sen. Mike Rounds: But here's the bottom line on this. They have gotten to be very, very good at cyber operations.</p>
<p>Mike Rounds thinks he knows why China is doing this.</p>
<p>The Republican senator of South Dakota is chair of the Armed Services Cybersecurity Subcommittee. He believes China intends to deter the U.S. from standing up in a fight by hacking our most sensitive industries</p><p>Sen. Mike Rounds: But all it takes is a blip on the financial markets to delay certain trades by just milliseconds, to put the market into an entirely different attitude about the security and the soundness of being able to make those transactions happen.</p><p>Scott Pelley: You're talking about causing chaos on Wall Street.</p><p>Sen. Mike Rounds: Threatening to be able to cause chaos on Wall Street would be something that they would love to do.</p><p>Scott Pelley: And turning the lights on and off.</p><p>Sen. Mike Rounds: Most certainly. Or to start out with, whether or not you can get an airline reservation. And so those are areas that they would love to-- just so that when the time comes, in my opinion, they can look at it and simply say, "We know where you're at. Don't mess with us. We're capable of causing real problems for you long term."</p>
<p>China is causing those problems by exploiting vulnerabilities in network equipment. In Littleton, Massachusetts, China found a weakness in a network firewall. That's not unusual when software vulnerabilities go unpatched or when out-of-date equipment is no longer supported with security updates. Once inside, China did not install malware which could be a red flag. Instead, it stole log-in credentials and masqueraded as a legitimate employee. </p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: They are just gaining access to that system and then attempting to lay dormant. They're not spending more time collecting intelligence or taking other activities.</p><p>Scott Pelley: It's there if they need it later.</p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: Exactly.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Do we even know how extensively the Chinese are into our systems?</p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: I don't think we have a perfect knowledge of that.</p><p>Scott Pelley: How many Chinese attacks are there on U.S. systems in a day?</p>
<p>Gen. Tim Haugh: I would exp-- expect that automated activity are happening at scans, at the-- the m-- millions of devices throughout every single day. </p><p>China denies the hacking. The White House told us it is working to "assess exposure and mitigate the damage." In Littleton, the damage forced Nick Lawler to completely rebuild his network, at a cost of more than $50,000. </p>
<p>Gen. Tim Haugh: It is much more consuming to try to get somebody out of a network than to deny them access, which is why it's so critically important that we get the basics right in our critical infrastructure and in these substantive networks so that we aren't expending more resource to try to root them out.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Tell me we're good at this.</p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: We are definitely good at this.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Really?</p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: But the scale is a challenge.</p>
<p>Very few understood the scale or the challenge as well as Gen. Haugh. In the first Trump administration he was promoted to two star general, then three star. But later, with a fourth star, he led the National Security Agency for only a little over a year. </p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: I got a phone call from a senior official in the Department of Defense that told me that the President had made a decision to remove me.</p><p><span class="link">He was fired</span>, in April, after a far-right activist named Laura Loomer met with the president. Online she explained that Haugh was "disloyal" and had been "referred for firing." The evidence she pointed to, publicly, was Haugh's appointment by President Biden. She called Haugh's firing "a blessing for the American people."</p><p>Scott Pelley: That has got to be galling--after your career.</p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: I-- I know in my heart that every day I wanted to achieve the things for our nation that would make us more secure and make every American safe, and that continued to my last day of service. So-- from that perspective-- it-- it certainly was impactful to me and my family. But at the end of the day, it's about our nation and it's about our nation's security.</p><p>Scott Pelley: You're sitting there with four stars on your shoulder, you have spent your entire life in the Air Force, and you've been accused of being disloyal. Your reaction is what?</p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: That every day I woke up committed to our national security and to meeting the expectations of the President.</p>
<p>Scott Pelley: Not disloyal?</p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: Absolutely not.</p><p>The White House did not answer our questions about Haugh's firing from the National Security Agency. Later, Haugh retired from the Air Force. </p><p><em>Sen. Mike Rounds: We do not have enough of these types of leaders, and a loss of any one of them without strong justification is disappointing.  </em></p><p>A new acting head of the National Security Agency was appointed but the week after the firing, Republican Mike Rounds, chair of the Senate's Cybersecurity Subcommittee, saw Haugh's sudden termination this way.</p><p><em>Sen. Mike Rounds: The departure of General Haugh is a loss for our nation but will be a tremendous gain for any private or public entity where he decides to lend his expertise and leadership. I wish him Godspeed. That said, as our adversaries watch this hearing, it will be clear that no matter the scenario, our cyber mission forces are ready.</em></p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: The National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command are consequential organizations. The second I was no longer the leader, focus shifts to them. They have consequential missions to do and for my family, it shifts to, how do we serve in different ways.</p>
<p>Today, Tim Haugh serves by teaching at Yale, and consulting private industry, but sidelined in government, as China expands its aggressive hacking, spying and theft of intellectual property. </p><p>Scott Pelley: There have been resignations and firings of other people focused on America's cyber defense. What does that mean for our national security?</p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: Our overall capacity is getting smaller while we know China's continues to grow. There is still immense capability in the U.S. government, and now it will be up to the administration to be able, to be able to use that and build partnerships with industry to be able to ensure that we're countering these threats.</p><p>Scott Pelley: If the United States does not dominate in this space, what is at stake?</p><p>Gen. Tim Haugh: First, I'm always confident in our nation. But if we don't dominate in this space, China gains advantage with the ability to continue to steal intellectual property, which impacts our economy. They could gain increased intelligence collection, which would help them every day and also in a crisis in conflict, and they could preposition in critical networks, both in the United States and with allies and partners that could give them advantage in a crisis. We can't let that happen.</p><p><em>Produced by Aaron Weisz. Associate producer, Ian Flickinger. Broadcast associate, Michelle Karim. Edited by April Wilson.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">China's capacity to hack the U.S. is growing, former NSA head says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Tim Haugh, the retired general and ousted former head of both the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, warns that <span class="link">China </span>has hacked into U.S. computer networks to an astonishing degree, targeting not just the U.S. military and industries, but also every American.</p><p>In the months since Mr. Trump's return to the White House, there have been resignations and firings of other people focused on America's cyber defense.</p><p>"Our overall capacity is getting smaller while we know China's continues to grow," Haugh told 60 Minutes. "There is still immense capability in the U.S. government, and now it will be up to the administration to be able to use that and build partnerships with industry to be able to ensure that we're countering these threats."</p><h2>What China is accessing in the U.S.</h2><p>Haugh rose to lead the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command in 2024, just as the scope of China's hacking of utilities became clear in a place no one would have imagined: Littleton, Massachusetts.</p><p>It's a small town with around 10,000 residents, 30 miles northwest of Boston. It's not a major supplier to the federal government or to a military base, yet China targeted the town. The FBI visited in November 2023 to tell Nick Lawler, general manager of the town's electric and water utility, that China had breached his utility's computer network. Lawler said the feds told him he was one of 200.</p>
<p>China had been on some American networks for at least five years around the time of the FBI's visit to Lawler.</p>
<p>At the water treatment plant, Lawler showed how dangerous a hack could have been. If China had managed to get control over the utilities water system, they could have poisoned the water. </p><p>But China was caught before it had operational control. Secure from danger, and with Lawler's permission, the federal investigators watched what China was doing and what they learned was part of an awakening for American security. </p><p>"If you are willing to go after a small water provider in Littleton, Massachusetts, what other target is off the list? So, from that perspective, this is a national threat. It's one that needs to be addressed," Haugh said. "But it's also one that every American should understand, because if they're willing to go after that small provider that doesn't have a national security connection, that means every target is on the list."</p><p>China denies hacking America's critical infrastructure. The White House recently told 60 Minutes it is working to "assess exposure and mitigate the damage." </p>
<p>No utility would talk to 60 Minutes about getting hacked by China except Littleton's Nick Lawler. He decided to speak out so Americans could understand the danger. </p><p>"I think initially we were surprised that China would target every American with these capabilities," Haugh said. "That goes against every norm of international law. That certainly goes against how the United States military would approach targeting in a crisis or a conflict. That the fact that they would go after basic services as part of their effort that they have identified as unrestricted warfare is unconscionable."</p><p>Other critical places believed to have been targeted by China over the years include New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 13 gas pipeline operators, the port of Houston and major phone companies. </p><p>China is causing those problems by exploiting vulnerabilities in network equipment. In Littleton, Massachusetts, China found a weakness in a network firewall. That's not unusual when software vulnerabilities go unpatched, or when out-of-date equipment is no longer supported with security updates. Once inside, China did not install malware, which could be a red flag. Instead, it stole login credentials and masqueraded as a legitimate employee.</p><p>"They are just gaining access to that system and then attempting to lay dormant. They're not spending more time collecting intelligence or taking other activities," Haugh said.</p><p>That access is there if they need it later, Haugh said. </p><p>Haugh said it's unclear how deep China's reach is into American systems, but believes that China is likely scanning millions of devices across the U.S. every day.</p>
<h2>Why China is hacking U.S. systems </h2><p>China is hacking critical infrastructure to try to ensure that it has an advantage in a crisis or a conflict, Haugh said.</p><p>"There's no advantage to be gained economically. There was no foreign intelligence-collection value. The only value would be for use in a crisis or a conflict," he said. </p><p>A hack in Littleton could distract the U.S., Haugh said.</p>
<p>"If we're involved in something in the Indo-Pacific that is becoming a challenge between the United States and China, the more that China could get us to focus at home means now our resources are focused in the homeland," he said. "That would distract us, distract resources, make it more difficult for us to mobilize in a crisis." </p><p>Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota and chair of the Armed Services Cybersecurity Subcommittee, said he believes China intends to try to deter the U.S. from engaging in a potential fight by using its cyber program to disrupt key American industries. </p><p>"All it takes is a blip on the financial markets to delay certain trades by just milliseconds, to put the market into an entirely different attitude about the security and the soundness of being able to make those transactions happen," he said. </p><p>China, he said, could threaten chaos on Wall Street to deter the United States. </p>
<p>"Those are areas that they would love to [access] just so that when the time comes, in my opinion, they can look at it and simply say, 'We know where you're at. Don't mess with us. We're capable of causing real problems for you long term,'" Rounds said. </p><h2>Stopping China</h2><p>While China continues accessing American systems, Haugh noted that the U.S. is "definitely good" at keeping adversaries out of networks, but that the scale is a challenge.</p><p>"It is much more consuming to try to get somebody out of a network than to deny them access, which is why it's so critically important that we get the basics right in our critical infrastructure and in these substantive networks so that we aren't expending more resources to try to root them out," Haugh said.</p><p><span class="link">Haugh was fired</span> in April after far-right activist Laura Loomer met with President Trump. Online she accused Haugh of disloyalty — pointing to his appointment by President Biden as evidence — and said he had been "...referred for firing." Haugh, in his first television interview since retirement, said he was "absolutely not" disloyal. </p><p>Rounds called Haugh's termination "a loss for our nation."</p>
<p>"We do not have enough of these types of leaders, and a loss of any one of them without strong justification is disappointing," Rounds said. </p><p>"The National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command are consequential organizations. The second I was no longer the leader, focus shifts to them," Haugh said. "They have consequential missions to do and for my family, it shifts to, 'How do we serve in different ways, through education, through partnering with innovators and working with industry to continue to advance many of these issues.'"</p>
<p>Today, Haugh is advancing these issues, teaching at Yale and consulting — sidelined in government as China expands its aggressive hacking, spying and theft of intellectual property. </p><p>He shared what he believes is at stake if the U.S. does not dominate in this space. </p><p>"First, I'm always confident in our nation.

<div class="article-title">Coral reefs are first environmental system to pass climate "tipping point"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><span class="link">Coral reefs</span> around the globe have for years suffered publicly in warming oceans, periodically making headlines when iconic underwater landscapes <span class="link">lose their colors</span> and wither during repeated mass bleaching events caused by climate change. Now, reefs are the first environmental system on Earth to pass a climate "tipping point," according to a new report by climate scientists who call the situation an "unprecedented crisis."</p><p>Researchers at the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute in England have released their second Global Tipping Points report, which examines some of the fundamental processes that support life on this planet in terms of their proximity to benchmarks that may signal permanent damage.</p><p>"Tipping points represent critical thresholds in Earth's climate system where small changes can lead to significant, often irreversible consequences," the authors said in their report. Steve Smith, a research fellow at the Global Systems Institute and one of the report's co-authors, told CBS News that tipping points are "all about that point at which change becomes self-propelling, kind of a self-accelerating change."</p>
<p>The report, published Sunday, comes three years after the institute released its first iteration in 2022 and about a month before the United Nations hosts COP30, an annual<span class="link"> climate change conference</span>, in Belém, Brazil, a city in <span class="link">the Amazon rainforest</span> that is itself an example of a major global ecosystem on the brink of a climate emergency. Tim Lenton, the director of the Global Systems Institute and lead author of the report, said in a statement that he hopes his team's findings make it onto the agenda.</p><p>"We are rapidly approaching multiple Earth system tipping points that could transform our world, with devastating consequences for people and nature," his statement said. "This demands immediate, unprecedented action from leaders at COP30 and policymakers worldwide."</p><p>The <span class="link">2015 Paris Agreement</span> set upper limits for global warming at 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius — between 2.7 and 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit — above average levels in preindustrial times. But leaders have repeatedly warned in the years since that countries are falling short of the emissions targets necessary to meet those temperature goals, with the U.N. declaring greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere reached all-time highs in 2023. By 2024, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported temperatures had risen to about 1.4 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average.</p>
<h2>"A new reality" </h2><p>Higher ocean temperatures have already degraded coral reefs, which are crucial for marine life and provide habitats for roughly one-fourth of all underwater species. The new report points out that reefs also support the livelihoods of about a billion people, so their deterioration is as much an economic threat as an environmental one.</p><p>Scientists have determined that the "tipping point" for coral reefs begins when global warming reaches about 1.2 degrees Celsius, with somewhere between 70 and 90% of coral dying when that number climbs to 1.5 degrees. </p><p>"We're very confident that, unfortunately, we're in the middle of the coral reef dieback," Smith said, which, he explained, essentially means "the collapse of coral reefs worldwide."</p><p>Reef death is often catalyzed by bleaching, when heat stress causes coral to purge the colorful algae that sustains it and, in turn, become pale and weak. If the stress persists and bleaching is severe or prolonged, the coral can completely break down.</p>
<p>The International Coral Reef Initiative announced in April that an estimated <span class="link">84% of the world's coral reefs</span> were under heat stress. As the new report notes, this is "the most extensive and intense" mass bleaching event ever recorded.</p>
<p>Small pockets of coral are expected to survive, Smith said, and preserving them while minimizing the progression of warming temperatures should be everyone's top priority.</p><p>"We're in a new reality whereby we can now say that we've passed the first major climate tipping point, which is the coral reefs," he said. "And obviously we'll have to, as we say, try to reduce the damage. The quicker that we can decarbonize and take greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, the better."</p><h2>Ice sheets, ocean currents and the Amazon rainforest</h2><p>Other environmental systems are on the verge of passing their tipping points, too, according to the report. In addition to coral reefs, it cited the potentially catastrophic effects of a warming world on the Amazon rainforest, ocean currents that influence weather patterns, and glaciers like the Greenland ice sheet, which is currently melting and shedding the equivalent of three Niagara Falls' worth of freshwater into the North Atlantic every hour.</p><p>"It's a race against time, really," said Smith. "We have to transform the whole energetic basis of society within a generation, away from fossil fuels and toward this cleaner, safer future to avoid these further tipping points beyond coral reefs and the devastating consequences that they would bring."</p><p>The report acknowledged meaningful headway has been made in the shift toward renewable energy, highlighting "positive tipping points" that have been crossed as the use of electric vehicles, solar power and wind power becomes more widespread. The rise of solar power, in particular, is one positive transition that Smith singled out as especially "remarkable" — although he emphasized that more still needs to be done, urgently, to bring the Earth back on track.</p><p>"Getting that into the heads of our senior decision-makers is going to be important," said Smith, "because what is traditionally thought of as high impact, low likelihood events, they're actually becoming high impact, high likelihood, if we don't do something now."</p>

<div class="article-title">In a major milestone, Hamas begins releasing final Israeli hostages</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>TEL AVIV — Hamas on Monday began releasing the final Israeli hostages held captive in Gaza, a major milestone in the efforts to end the devastating two years of war in the Palestinian territory.</p> <p>Hamas initially handed over seven of the 20 living hostages to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which in turn presented them to the Israeli military, according to a statement by the military. The remaining 13 hostages were expected to be released shortly. </p> <p>The military is flying the hostages by helicopter from southern Israel to hospitals in the Tel Aviv area. All the hostages are men, mostly in their 20s and 30s.</p>
<p>Israeli television showed Einav Zangauker speaking to her son, Matan Zangauker, 25, in a video call shortly after his release. "There's no war, it's over. You are coming home," she told him. </p> <p>The hostage handover ignited celebrations throughout Israel. Tens of thousands gathered in Hostages Square, the plaza in Tel Aviv that has been the site of vigils throughout the war. The crowd roared in jubilation and waved blue-and-white Israeli flags.</p>
<p>Hamas is also required to hand over 28 bodies of dead hostages, though the Palestinian group says it has not been able to locate all of them. In turn, Israel is preparing to hand over nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees as it is required to do under the truce announced last week. These exchanges are expected to begin later Monday.</p> <p>The fast-moving developments came as President Trump landed in Israel. The president pressed hard for the ceasefire deal and is widely credited for getting it to the finish line. Trump is scheduled to meet briefly with family members of the hostages and then address Israel's parliament, the Knesset, in Jerusalem.</p> <p>Shortly afterward, Trump is set to fly to Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, where the truce was negotiated last week, to take part in a formal signing ceremony.</p>
<p>On another front, increased aid is beginning to flow into Gaza, where essentials have been in critically short supply throughout the war. Hundreds of trucks with assistance entered southern Gaza from Egypt on Sunday. The territory is in urgent need of food, water, medicine, fuel and tents.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Test for the ceasefire</h3> <p>The exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners is the first major test of the ceasefire and was a leading demand by both the Israelis and Palestinians.</p> <p>If both sides complete the full exchange as planned, it will help improve the atmosphere for the many tough challenges ahead.</p> <p>However, many obstacles remain. Israeli troops still hold roughly half of Gaza and there's no timetable for their full withdrawal.</p> <p>The ceasefire also calls for Hamas to give up its weapons and play no role in the future governance of Gaza. Hamas has not publicly agreed to this, and Hamas civilian police have already re-emerged on the streets of the territory. There is currently no other Palestinian group in Gaza that is capable of ruling the territory.</p> <p>The ceasefire calls for a group of Palestinian technocrats to run Gaza on an interim basis, but they have not been named and it is not clear what kind of authority they would have, if any. <br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Pastors and staff from underground church are arrested in China</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A Christian pastor and father of U.S. citizens along with dozens of church staff and members have been arrested in China amid a crackdown, his daughter and the church say.</p> <p>Ezra Jin, founder and pastor of Zion Church, a large "underground house church" with congregations across China, was arrested Friday while at his home Beihai in the country's Guangxi region, his daughter Grace Jin Drexel told NPR.</p> <p>"It's been extremely shocking and … very scary for our family," Jin Drexel said. "But we also have faith in the Lord and we know that he [Ezra Jin] is doing God's work."</p>
<p>More than 30 pastors and church staff were arrested or became unreachable by family starting on Thursday, said Sean Long, a pastor and spokesperson for Zion Church. Some of them are facing criminal charges, he said, including for "illegal dissemination of religious information via the internet."</p> <p>Witnesses said police had a "wanted list" and were violent during arrests, according to Long. One female pastor was forcefully separated from her newborn baby, he also said.</p> <p>"We strongly appeal to the global church society to hold the Chinese government accountable," Long told NPR. "They cannot do whatever they want without letting people know. Let our ministers and staff members be released as soon as possible. Stop arresting our members."</p>
<p>NPR reached out to the Chinese embassy for comment on Sunday but has not received a response.</p> <p>China has in recent years arrested and detained Christian leaders of underground churches, who are not registered with the government and under its control. The Chinese government has also detained and imprisoned Muslims. </p> <p>The Chinese Communist Party regards Christianity and Islam as "foreign" and subject to influence by outsiders.</p> <p>Still, tens of millions of Chinese attend unregistered churches rather than state-sanctioned ones.</p> <p>Zion Church was subject to an earlier raid and shutdown in 2018, during a previous crackdown on independent churches. Since then it has re-emerged with a hybrid of online and in-person meetings at various locations across China.</p>
<h2 class="edTag"><strong>The church says it is not a threat to China</strong></h2>
<p>Before becoming a pastor, Jin was a Peking University student during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and earned a doctorate in ministry from Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif.</p> <p>Long and Jin Drexel both said Jin may have sensed the arrest was coming, telling them both in recent weeks that persecution could lead to a new wave of revival among Christianity. Jin also discussed his legacy with his family and told them to have video footage of him prepared so that his grandchildren would know about him in case something happened, his daughter also said.</p>
<p>"He was very clear eyed about what the government is and what he is doing. So I think he became a pastor knowing that one day it is possible that he will be imprisoned," Jin Drexel said. "Prior to the [2018] shutdown of the church, he was in the U.S. and he could have stayed in the U.S. at that point and applied for asylum … but he felt that he had to go back with the church and be with the church while it was suffering."</p> <p>The recent arrests have also taken place amid tensions between the U.S. and China, particularly over trade. President Trump on Friday threatened a 100% tariff on Chinese imports.</p> <p>Zion Church was founded in 2007 and representatives say it has grown rapidly in recent years, with services reaching around 5,000 to 10,000 people each week.</p> <p>This growth, as well as the U.S.-China tensions, could be behind the recent crackdown, according to Long, who says the Chinese government wants to exert control over its citizens and views Zion Church as a threat.</p> <p>But he said Zion Church is not a threat to or opposed to the Chinese government.</p> <p>"We are not criminals but Christians," Long said. "We are not anti-CCP [Chinese Communist Party], we are not anti-China. We love our people, love our society, love our culture. We are not a Western political force. That is 100% wrong. We are a Chinese house church adhering to historic Christian faith. We are believers of Jesus. We have nothing to do with the U.S.-China tension or competition."</p>
<h2 class="edTag"><strong>U.S. officials call for Jin's release</strong></h2> <p>U.S. officials and lawmakers have denounced the arrests. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called for the pastors to be released.</p>
<p>"This crackdown further demonstrates how the CCP exercises hostility towards Christians who reject Party interference in their faith and choose to worship at unregistered house churches," Rubio said in a statement on Sunday. "We call on the CCP to immediately release the detained church leaders and to allow all people of faith, including members of house churches, to engage in religious activities without fear of retribution."</p> <p>Congregants of Zion Church are afraid and it is a very disturbing moment for its leaders, Long said. But the arrests will not deter church members from practicing their faith.</p> <p>"We will still have online service and we will not stop what we are doing," Long said. "We will share the good news of Jesus Christ no matter what."</p>

<p>Nearly two months after a deadly, massive measles outbreak in Texas was declared over, the highly contagious disease continues to spread across the country. The U.S. has now confirmed 1,563 cases this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the highest annual number in more than three decades.</p> <p>But the true total could be even higher, says Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p> <p>"If you talk to people on the ground, including not only in Texas, but other states, they all say the same thing, which is that the numbers are much worse than that. Probably closer to 5,000 cases," Offit says. "And it's not done."</p>
<p>He points to the current outbreak in South Carolina, where more than 150 unvaccinated schoolchildren at two schools are now subject to a 21-day quarantine after being exposed to measles. The state Department of Public Health this past week reported the eighth confirmed measles case since Sept. 25. Public health officials say it's not clear if that new case, in Greenville County, is linked to seven cases that are part of a current outbreak in neighboring Spartanburg County, S.C.</p>
<p>"What this new case tells us is that there is active, unrecognized community transmission of measles occurring," Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina's state epidemiologist, told reporters during a briefing Thursday. She said that makes it vital that the public receive the recommended measles vaccination.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a large measles outbreak along the border areas of Arizona and southwestern Utah continues to grow, with Utah now reporting 55 cases this year as of Friday. Nearly all of the cases occurred in people who were unvaccinated. Six people required hospitalization. According to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, wastewater testing shows that the measles virus is more widespread in the state than previously known. In neighboring Arizona, officials have reported 63 cases so far this year.</p>
<p>And in Minnesota, officials last week reported that a small, recent surge in measles cases there has brought the state's total for the year to 20.</p> <p>All told, the CDC has confirmed 44 measles outbreaks in 41 states this year. The agency defines an outbreak as three or more cases that are linked.<strong> </strong>The vast majority of cases were in people who were unvaccinated; 27% percent have been in children under the age of 5. About 1 in 8 measles cases have resulted in hospitalization.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Widespread vaccination in the U.S. has saved hundreds of lives each year</h3> <p>Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to humans. On average, an infected person will infect as many as 18 other unvaccinated people. A person with measles can emit infectious particles that linger in the air for up to two hours, long after they've left a room. That's why it's so highly transmissible.</p> <p>Before widespread vaccination, pretty much everyone got measles in childhood. And 400-500 people in the U.S. used to die from it each year.</p>
<p>The disease was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. To protect communities against outbreaks, they need a vaccination rate of 95%, according to the CDC.</p> <p>Nationwide, measles vaccination rates have been slipping for years — they're currently at 92.5%. The trend predates the current administration, but Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City, says it doesn't help that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a long history of criticizing vaccines. Ratner notes that acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill has suggested breaking up the standard measles, mumps and rubella vaccine into three separate shots, which Ratner says is neither feasible nor is it backed by data.</p> <p>The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on Sunday.</p> <p>"It's no wonder that parents are, you know, confused and frightened," says Ratner, the author of <em>Booster Shots</em>, a history of the fight against measles and its recent resurgence.</p>
<p>In some communities, kindergarten vaccination rates are much lower than the national average. That's created pockets of opportunity for measles to spread, Ratner says.</p> <p>"If a measles case comes into a place with a low vaccination rate, it can really take off," Ratner says. "That's what we saw in Gaines County" — the epicenter of the Texas outbreak that saw 762 cases and two deaths — "and that's what we're seeing in lots of places."</p>

<div class="article-title">Who are the 20 Gaza hostages believed to be alive and expected to be released?</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>TEL AVIV, Israel —During the Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 251 people were abducted and taken across the border into Gaza. Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, the remaining hostages are expected to be released on Monday. After more than two years, Israeli officials say that of the 48 remaining Israeli and foreign hostages, 20 are still believed to be alive. Following their release, Israel will free around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The hostages are expected to be freed early Monday morning. These are the names and stories of the hostages Israel believes remain alive:</p>
<p><strong>Alon Ohel (24)</strong> — a musician and pianist, Ohel was kidnapped from the Nova music festival, dragged from a shelter where he was hiding among the wounded and dead. His parents, prominent advocates for the hostages' return, placed dozens of pianos across Israel with the message "You are not alone." In 2024, his mother, Idit Ohel, organized a concert for him on the Gaza border. She told NPR, "I know that he's alive because he was taken alive, and I know that he's alive because I'm a mother."</p> <p><strong>Ariel (28) and David (35) Cunio</strong> — brothers from Kibbutz Nir Oz, were abducted on Oct.7 along with their wives and children. While their families were freed in earlier deals, the brothers remained in captivity. In July 2025, their mother, Sylvia, said: "I always try to stay optimistic because there's no other way… I just want them all home."</p> <p><strong>Avinatan Or (32)</strong> — the second of seven siblings, holds a degree in electrical and computer engineering and worked in high-tech. He was kidnapped from the Nova festival with his partner, Noa Argamani, who was rescued by Israeli forces last year. Footage of their abduction, showing Hamas gunmen separating them, became a defining image of the Oct.7 attacks. In March 2025, released hostages delivered a sign of life from him to his family.</p>
<p><strong>Bar Kupershtein</strong> <strong>(23)</strong> — the eldest of five siblings and the family's main breadwinner after his father became disabled, was abducted to Gaza while working at the Nova festival. Passionate about motorcycles, he was last seen in a Hamas video in April 2025 alongside hostage Maksim Harkin</p> <p><strong>Elkana Bohbot (36)</strong> — was working at the Nova music festival when he was abducted. Several videos of him in captivity have surfaced, the most recent in May 2025. Three months ago, his mother told Galei Tzahal (Army Radio): "I don't want to hear any more talk—I just want to see the headline, 'We signed the deal.' I'm exhausted from promises. I've lost my sanity, my optimism. My body can't take it anymore."</p> <p><strong>Eitan Horn (39)</strong> — was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz alongside his brother Yair, who was released earlier this year. An informal education professional, Eitan spent part of his captivity with Yair, and the brothers reportedly fled through tunnels during Israeli airstrikes. Yair's release in February 2025 brought relief to the family, but left them deeply anxious for Eitan.</p> <p><strong>Eitan Mor (25)</strong> — the eldest of eight siblings, he worked as a barista and dreamed of opening his own café. He was kidnapped from the Nova festival, where he worked as a security guard. Released hostages described him as a morale booster who even confronted captors on behalf of others. His family in Kiryat Arba has publicly opposed compromise deals with Hamas, arguing they endanger Israelis long-term.</p> <p><strong>Evyatar David (24)</strong>— worked as a café shift manager and was planning a trip to Southeast Asia. He was kidnapped from the Nova music festival alongside his friend Guy Gilboa Dalal. In Aug. 2025, Hamas released videos showing him emaciated, digging his own grave under their orders, and, speaking under duress, urging the Israeli Prime Minister to agree to a ceasefire. The footage sparked outrage and dismay across Israel.</p>
<p><strong>Gali Berman and Ziv Berman (28)</strong>— twin brothers from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, were abducted from their home on Oct. 7. Lovers of soccer and travel, they ran a sound and lighting company together and had recently returned from a trip to Costa Rica. Released hostages reported that as of Feb. 2025, the brothers were alive but being held separately—the longest time they had ever spent apart, according to their older brother Liran.</p>
<p><strong>Guy Gilboa-Dalal (24)</strong> — an animation and Japanese anime enthusiast who had planned to travel to Japan, was abducted from the Nova festival on Oct. 7 alongside his close friend Evyatar David. His brother Gal, managed to escape. In Feb. 2025, Hamas released a video showing them witnessing their friends' release. Released hostages reported that Guy endured severe abuse and starvation, leaving him in extremely poor physical and mental condition.</p>
<p><strong>Maxim Herkin</strong> <strong>(35)</strong> — an Israel-Russian dual national and immigrant from Ukraine, was abducted from the Nova festival, where two of his close friends were killed. A father to a daughter in Russia and with a partner in Israel, he texted his mother "I love you" the day he was taken and has had no contact since. In May 2025, Hamas released a video showing him pale and thin. His mother told Israeli media, "Until I get my son back, I won't say thank you."</p> <p><strong>Matan Angrest (22)</strong> —the soldier was captured when his tank was attacked by Hamas near the Gaza perimeter fence. A sports and soccer enthusiast, he reportedly endured abuse and interrogations by Hamas operatives, according to released hostages. His last known appearance was in a Hamas video released in March 2025.</p> <p><strong>Matan Zangauker (25)</strong> -was abducted from his home at Kibbutz Nir Oz along with his partner, Ilana Gritzewsky, who was released in Nov. 2023. The couple worked at the kibbutz's medical cannabis farm, and their home was among the first targeted by Hamas on Oct. 7. Matan's mother, who raised him and his two sisters alone, has become a leading voice for the hostages' families and was named one of the BBC's 100 Women of 2024.</p> <p><strong>Nimrod Cohen (20)</strong> – a soldier taken from his tank during the Oct. 7 attacks near the Nirim kibbutz close to the border with Gaza. He was 19 at the time. Hamas released footage of his capture, and released hostages later confirmed he is alive, though in poor physical and mental condition. A nature lover who enjoys hiking and video games, his mother, Viki, wrote on social media after the ceasefire: "My child, you are coming home."</p>
<p><strong>Omri Miran (48)</strong> - a shiatsu therapist and head gardener at Kibbutz Nir Oz, was abducted from his home in Nahal Oz on Oct. 7, 2023, in front of his wife and two daughters. Hamas later released footage of his kidnapping. The oldest living hostage still held in Gaza, his father, Dani Miran, has become a leading advocate for the hostages' release. Speaking to NPR last week, he said, "I feel on top of the world—as if my son has been born again."</p> <p><strong>Rom Braslavski (21)</strong> – a soldier from Jerusalem working as a security guard at the Nova festival, was abducted after helping others escape, his family said. In April 2025, Islamic Jihad released a video showing him emaciated and in poor health. Contact with him was lost in July, but Israeli officials believe he is still alive. His parents have been leading voices in the hostages' family's movement.</p> <p><strong>Segev Kalfon (27)</strong> - Kalfon was abducted while trying to escape Hamas gunmen at the Nova music festival. A friend later told his family that militants approached their car and seized Segev, a Tel Aviv finance student who had been diagnosed with severe anxiety just weeks earlier after a car accident. His mother fears for his health, saying he's been denied critical medication.</p> <p><strong>Yosef Chaim Ohana (25)</strong> - a bartender and the eldest son of a single mother he helped support, loves cycling, camping, and hiking. He was abducted from the Nova festival after risking his life to help others escape the attack. Released hostages later reported seeing him alive, and in May 2025 Hamas released a video showing him alongside fellow hostage Elkana Buchbut.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Vance says administration will keep fighting to send National Guard to Chicago</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>After an appeals court again blocked the government's attempt to deploy the National Guard in the<strong> </strong>Chicago<strong> </strong>area, Vice President JD Vance says the Trump administration will "litigate this as much as we can."</p> <p>His comments came one day after a federal appeals court in Illinois ruled that the Trump administration can keep federalized National Guard members in the state of Illinois but cannot deploy them for now.</p>
<p>"We're obviously going to litigate this as much as we can," Vance said on ABC's <em>This Week</em> Sunday. "We think that we have the authority to provide proper safety to our citizens all over the United States, but particularly in Chicago."</p> <p>The ruling Saturday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is the latest development in the administration's ongoing push to deploy National Guard members to a number of Democratic cities and states across the U.S., including Chicago and Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>Trump and other administration officials have claimed that federal forces are necessary to control crime and protect federal agents, while leaders in those cities and others say there is no need for National Guard troops and accuse the Trump administration of overstepping its authority.</p>
<p>Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat who's sparred with Trump over the National Guard deployment, said no troops are on the streets of Chicago thanks to the multiple judicial rulings. "We've got to rely on the courts to do the right thing," he told ABC's <em>This Week</em>.</p> <p>Most of the 500 National Guard members from Texas and Illinois were based at a U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, Illinois, while a smaller group was sent to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Broadview, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>The legal back-and-forth rolls on as the country's third-largest city hosts the Bank of America Chicago Marathon on Sunday, which organizers say will draw more than 53,000 runners and 1.7 million spectators to city streets.</p> <p>There had been some question about whether the race would be a target of the Trump administration's ramped-up immigration enforcement efforts in the Chicago area, also known as "Operation Midway Blitz."</p>
<p>But ICE told the Chicago Sun-Times in a statement that it "does not conduct operations at sensitive locations, such as public events, unless there are exigent circumstances." The Chicago Park District said in a social media post that it had not received any information about ICE agents at the marathon, "contrary to a post circulating on social media."</p>
<p>Enrique Rivera, organizer of the predominantly Latino running club Venados, told member station WBEZ that he was less concerned for runners during the race itself than while they were preparing for it.</p> <p>"I'm more afraid of individuals that are out there trying to do this in a group of three, a group of four, right?" Rivera said. That's where you know something can happen, and your family won't find out for days."</p> <p>Along with Portland, Chicago has been a national flashpoint in recent weeks for the Trump administration's national immigration crackdown.</p> <p>On Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge April Perry of the Northern District of Illinois blocked the government from federalizing and deploying National Guard troops in the state. Perry said descriptions of recent protests around Chicago offered by Trump administration attorneys were "simply unreliable" and issued the 14-day order, though it was partially overturned by an appeals court just two days later.</p> <p>Still, clashes between protesters and federal agents have continued in the Chicago area. On Friday a journalist with Chicago's WGN television station, Debbie Brockman, was detained by law enforcement agents and later released. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Brockman "threw objects at border patrol's car" but no charges have been filed, the <em>Guardian</em> reported.</p>

<div class="article-title">Shooting at packed South Carolina bar kills 4 and injures at least 20 others</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>ST. HELENA ISLAND, S.C. — A mass shooting early Sunday at a crowded bar on an idyllic island considered to be the largest Gullah community on the South Carolina coast has left four people dead and at least 20 injured, officials said.</p> <p>A large crowd was at Willie's Bar and Grill on St. Helena Island when sheriff's deputies arrived and found many people with gunshot wounds. An estimated 5,000 or more Gullah people living on the island trace their ancestry back to enslaved West Africans who once worked rice plantations in the area before being freed by the Civil War.</p>
<p>Bar owner Willie Turral was inside the establishment, which was packed for a high school alumni event, when he heard shots going off "in bursts" outside. He described the scene: "Screaming and panic and fear."</p> <p>The Beaufort County Sheriff's Office said in a statement on the social platform X that many people ran to nearby businesses seeking shelter from the gunfire.</p> <p>"This is a tragic and difficult incident for everyone," the statement said. "We ask for your patience as we continue to investigate this incident. Our thoughts are with all of the victims and their loved ones."</p> <p>Among the injured, four were in critical condition at hospitals Sunday afternoon. The victims' identities were not released.</p> <p>Turral said the bar was hosting an event for alumni of Battery Creek High School in Beaufort, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) northwest of St. Helena Island. He said people were having a good time when the shots were heard.</p> <p>"It was scary from the inside," he said, with "people not knowing what's really going on outside, people trying to get to safety."</p> <p>U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace posted on X that she was "COMPLETELY HEARTBROKEN to learn about the devastating shooting."</p> <p>Willie's Bar and Grill advertises itself as serving authentic Gullah-inspired cuisine and describes itself on its website as "not just a restaurant but a community pillar committed to giving back, especially to our youth."</p>
<p>Smaller enclaves of Gullah, referred to as Geechee in some areas, are scattered along the Southeast coast from North Carolina to Florida. Scholars say separation from the mainland caused the Gullah to retain much of their African heritage, including a unique dialect and skills such as cast-net fishing and basket weaving.</p>

<div class="article-title">"It feels terrible." Federal worker's family tightens their belts as shutdown drags on</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>In a way, Stephanie Rogers started preparing for the current moment months ago, when she and her two daughters moved in with her mother about half an hour south of Denver. High prices for everything was certainly one reason.</p> <p>"When you added up the numbers between both of our family households, it was going to be something that we could not keep going long term," says Rogers, who's 44 and divorced with no child support.</p> <p>Rogers has been a microbiologist with the Food and Drug Administration for 16 years and is now among hundreds of thousands of federal employees not working. She is also a chapter president with the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU).</p>
<p>Another big motivation for living together? The uncertainty of a new administration focused on shrinking the government, plus Rogers' memory of the last federal shutdown, back in 2018.</p> <p>"And we're living in that reality now," she says. "And so that is our decision, to just make sure all of us survive this process."</p> <p>Her mother, Nina Chapman, says she loves having her granddaughters around. "I was grateful we had a basement.  It was just a wonderful area to put everybody," she says.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Planning ahead for life without a paycheck</h3> <p>When the previous shutdown dragged on for 35 days, from late 2018 into 2019, Rogers says she was "utterly unprepared." So she made sure to plan better this time.</p> <p>In the weeks before this shutdown, as the deadline for the funding lapse approached, she rushed to squeeze in medical appointments. She requested early refills of the kids' medications in case she couldn't afford them without a paycheck.</p> <p>Rogers also made a painful decision that will carry its own financial cost. "I had to pull out of my retirement, which has some tax consequences for next year," she says.</p>
<p>Rogers has asked for flexibility with her car payment and is thinking twice about extracurriculars for her girls, who are 10 and 12. They might have to skip field trips that cost extra or volleyball games that are a long drive away. And the plan has been to buy only essential food.</p> <p>"In fact, we just had our freezer go out," she says. "We lost our meat, and that's just devastating to us because we were counting on that."</p> <p>Rogers has also applied for state unemployment. Furloughed federal workers are generally eligible for that, though they must refund the money when the shutdown ends, and after they get any retroactive pay withheld during that time.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">"We don't know what our future looks like"</h3> <p>But President Trump has floated the idea that some workers might be denied backpay, despite a law he signed mandating it in 2019. He's also threatened mass firings during the shutdown, a process the administration said had begun Friday. And Trump has talked about permanently cutting "Democrat programs," without saying specifically what that means. Rogers says all of this makes the current shutdown feel very different.</p> <p>"It feels terrible," she says. "I don't know if I even have a job when I walk away from this, much less if I will get paid. Do I have health insurance if we don't get back pay? It's a really hard place to be in when you have children who rely on you."</p> <p>Rogers believes she and other federal employees do essential work — such as food inspections — that the general public may only appreciate when they're gone. </p> <p>But across the federal government, it's been stressful all year. Mass layoffs and funding cuts have left fewer people working longer hours, she says, only to be sent the message now that they're not really wanted.</p> <p>"My mother worries about [it] constantly. My daughter has woken up and said, 'Does mommy have a job today?' We don't know what our future looks like," she says.</p> <p>So even though she's in her dream job, Rogers says she's started applying for other positions outside the federal government.</p>

<div class="article-title">Afghanistan says it has killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in overnight border operations</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>KABUL, Afghanistan — Afghanistan said Sunday it killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in overnight border operations, in response to what it called repeated violations of its territory and airspace.</p> <p>Earlier in the week, Afghan authorities accused Pakistan of bombing the capital, Kabul, and a market in the country's east. Pakistan did not claim responsibility for the assault.</p> <p>The Taliban government's chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said Afghan forces have captured 25 Pakistani army posts, 58 soldiers have been killed, and 30 others wounded.</p> <p>"The situation on all official borders and de facto lines of Afghanistan is under complete control, and illegal activities have been largely prevented," Mujahid told a press conference in Kabul. There was no immediate confirmation from Pakistan about casualties.</p>
<p>Pakistan has previously struck locations inside Afghanistan, targeting what it alleges are militant hideouts, but these have been in remote and mountainous areas. The two sides have also skirmished along the border in the past. Saturday night's heavy clashes underscore the deepening tensions.</p> <p>The Taliban government's Defense Ministry said early Sunday morning its forces had conducted "retaliatory and successful operations" along the border.</p> <p>"If the opposing side again violates Afghanistan's territorial integrity, our armed forces are fully prepared to defend the nation's borders and will deliver a strong response," the ministry added.</p> <p>The Torkham border crossing, one of two main trade routes between the two countries, did not open on Sunday at its usual time of 8 am.</p> <p>The crossing at Chaman, southwest Pakistan, was also closed. People, including Afghan refugees leaving Pakistan, were turned away due to the worsening security situation.</p> <p>An Associated Press reporter in Chaman heard jets over Spin Boldak, a city in Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province, and saw smoke rising after an explosion.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Regional powers call for calm as Pakistan condemns attack</h3> <p>Pakistan accuses Afghan authorities of harboring members of the banned group Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Islamabad says the group carries out deadly attacks inside Pakistan, but Kabul denies the charge, saying it does not allow its territory to be used against other countries.</p>
<p>Before the Afghan claim of casualties, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the assault and said the country's army "not only gave a befitting reply to Afghanistan's provocations but also destroyed several of their posts, forcing them to retreat."</p> <p>Pakistani security officials shared videos purporting to show destroyed Afghanistan checkposts, but the footage could not be independently verified because the media does not have access to these areas.</p> <p>The Saudi Foreign Ministry issued a statement late Saturday, calling for "restraint, avoidance of escalation and the adoption of dialogue and wisdom to help de-escalate tensions and maintain the security and stability of the region."</p> <p>Saudi Arabia just reached a mutual defense pact with Pakistan, which apparently put the kingdom under Islamabad's nuclear umbrella following Israel's attack on Qatar.</p> <p>Qatar also expressed concern about the escalating tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p> <p>A senior Pakistani security official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said Afghan forces opened fire in several northwestern border areas in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including the districts of Chitral, Bajaur, Mohmand, Angoor Adda and Kurram.</p> <p>The official also said troops responded with heavy weaponry near Tirah in Khyber district and across the frontier in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province.</p> <p>The two countries share a 2,611-kilometer (1,622-mile) border known as the Durand Line, but Afghanistan has never recognized it.</p>

<div class="article-title">China vows to stand firm against Trump's 100% tariff threat</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>BEIJING — China signaled Sunday that it would not back down in the face of a 100% tariff threat from President Donald Trump, urging the U.S. to resolve differences through negotiations instead of threats.</p> <p>"China's stance is consistent," the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online. "We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one."</p> <p>It was China's first official comment on Trump's threat to jack up the tax on imports from China by Nov. 1 in response to new Chinese restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are vital to a wide range of consumer and military products.</p>
<p>The back and forth threatens to derail a possible meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping and end a truce in a trade war in which new tariffs from both sides briefly topped 100% in April.</p> <p>Trump has raised taxes on imports from many U.S. trading partners since taking office in January, seeking to win concessions. China has been one of the few countries that hasn't backed down, relying on its economic clout.</p> <p>"Frequently resorting to the threat of high tariffs is not the correct way to get along with China," the Commerce Ministry said in its post, which was presented as a series of answers from an unnamed spokesperson to four questions from unspecified media outlets.</p> <p>The statement called for addressing any concerns through dialogue.</p> <p>"If the U.S. side obstinately insists on its practice, China will be sure to resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," the post said.</p> <p>In addition to the 100% tariff, Trump threatened to impose export controls on what he called "critical software," without specifying what that means.</p> <p>Both sides accuse the other of violating the spirit of the truce by imposing new restrictions on trade.</p> <p>Trump said in a social media post that China is "becoming very hostile" and that it is holding the world captive by restricting access to rare earth metals and magnets.</p>
<p>The Chinese Commerce Ministry post said the U.S. has introduced several new restrictions in recent weeks, including expanding the number of Chinese companies subject to U.S. export controls.</p> <p>On rare earths, the ministry said that export licenses would be granted for legitimate civilian uses, noting that the minerals also have military applications.</p> <p>The new regulations include a requirement that foreign companies get Chinese government approval to export items that contain rare earths sourced from China, no matter where the products are manufactured.</p> <p>China accounts for nearly 70% of the world's rare earths mining and controls roughly 90% of their global processing. Access to the material is a key point of contention in trade talks between Washington and Beijing.</p> <p>The critical minerals go into many products, from jet engines, radar systems and electric vehicles to consumer electronics including laptops and phones. China's export controls have hit European and other manufacturers, as well as American ones.</p> <p>The Commerce Ministry statement said that the U.S. is also ignoring Chinese concerns by going forward with new port fees on Chinese ships that take effect Tuesday. China announced Friday that it would impose port fees on American ships in response.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Democrats say extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits is urgent. Republicans say there's plenty of time to figure it out.</p> <p>As the government shutdown goes on, there are a lot of mixed messages on Capitol Hill about the health care issue at the center of the fight.</p> <p>The tax credits that make ACA health care premiums affordable for many Americans don't expire until December, as Republican lawmakers note. But Democratic lawmakers want to see them extended before enrollment begins Nov. 1, and they have made that a condition of voting to reopen the government.</p> <p>It's not just a battle over political messaging. These are real health insurance marketplaces where real people — 24 million of them — buy coverage. The amount the federal government picks up for their monthly premiums makes a big difference. </p>
<p>Here are five key facts about the policy.</p> <p><strong>1. The public supports the subsidies</strong></p> <p>A poll last week found that more than three-quarters of people across the political spectrum are in favor of Congress extending the enhanced ACA tax credits. The poll was conducted by KFF, the nonpartisan health research organization.</p> <p>"What we found is 78% of the public — including majorities of Democrats, independents, Republicans and [Make America Great Again] supporters — all think Congress should extend the premium tax credits beyond 2025," says Ashley Kirzinger, KFF's director of survey methodology.</p> <p>Other polls have had similar findings: 72% of voters across political parties supported extending the policy, according to a July survey by Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward. They surveyed two dozen competitive congressional districts and found that support for the policy was high even for those who had no personal connection to these health plans.</p> <p>In a memo, they wrote: "Voters don't want to see people losing their health insurance."</p> <p><strong>2. The issue is urgent since open enrollment starts soon</strong></p> <p>North Dakota's insurance commissioner, Jon Godfread, says the enhanced subsidies need to be extended before open enrollment starts Nov. 1, calling on lawmakers to "do this now."</p> <p>He's an elected Republican in his state and the president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a membership organization of state insurance regulators across the United States. "Red state, blue state, appointed, elected — we have unanimous approval supporting these tax credits," he says.</p>
<p>If Congress acts quickly, the marketplaces could possibly show the subsidized rates to those who log in to shop as soon as open enrollment begins. "Most states, if not all states, had their [insurance] carriers file two sets of rates — one with subsidies, one without," he says. "And so if they do a clean extension of these subsidies, I think most states will be ready to go on that."</p> <p>If Congress misses that deadline, he says, consumers who log in to shop for a plan will see much higher premiums and they may not come back, even if Congress ultimately extends the credits by the end of December.</p> <p><strong>3. Premiums are set to shoot up next year</strong></p> <p>When health insurers were setting their rates for 2026, they factored in the rising cost of health care, plus the possibility that the subsidies would expire and drive the healthiest people out of the ACA marketplaces.</p> <p>When researchers at KFF analyzed 2026 insurance filings, they found that premiums will double for many consumers next year. "On average, we're expecting premium payments by enrollees to increase by 114% if these enhanced tax credits expire," says Cynthia Cox, director of the Program on the ACA at KFF.</p> <p>Sky-high premiums might drive people to risk it and go uninsured, she says. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 4 million people will become uninsured in the next few years if the enhanced tax credits expire.</p> <p><strong>4. Most enrollees live in states that Trump won</strong></p> <p>The people who rely on HealthCare.gov and the other Obamacare marketplaces are people who "work at a place that doesn't offer them coverage," explains Cox, of KFF. "A lot of times, that's a small business. Or it could be farmers and ranchers. It could be gig workers like Uber drivers."</p> <p>Geographically, more than 3 in 4 enrollees live in states that President Trump won in 2024, according to KFF. Part of that is due to the fact that some Southern states have seen dramatic growth in enrollment recently. "In six states (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia and West Virginia), enrollment has more than tripled in five years," notes Cox's colleague Emma Wager.</p>
<p><strong>5. The subsidies are expensive for the government</strong></p> <p>The subsidies that kept costs down for consumers cost the federal government a lot of money. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would cost the government $350 billion over the next decade if the enhanced subsidies were extended permanently.</p> <p>Conservative groups that have always opposed the Affordable Care Act are against the enhanced subsidies. A coalition of groups recently argued in a letter to the president that the enhanced tax credits were meant to be temporary during the COVID-19 pandemic and that extending them will exacerbate rising health care costs.</p> <p>"While some Americans may be concerned about premiums going up in the short term, removing the incentive for insurers to continue raising their prices will save patients money in the long run," they write.</p> <p>Other Republicans — like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri — have said they support extending the tax credits or coming up with a different plan to prevent dramatic rate hikes for consumers.</p> <p>Godfread, the Republican insurance commissioner of North Dakota, says that the debate over rising health costs is real and worthwhile, but there's urgency in this moment.</p> <p>"That discussion is separate," he argues. "We can talk about the costs of health care and pharmaceuticals, all the pieces — but we've still got to get access to consumers and that's what these subsidies have helped provide."</p>
