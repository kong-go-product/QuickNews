<div class="article-title">Northern California voters weigh in on Prop 50 redistricting fight</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Voting began this week for a statewide special election that would drastically alter California’s congressional map. Proposition 50, or Prop 50, could add as many as five Democratic-held seats in Congress in time for the 2026 midterms.</p><p>The measure asks California voters to temporarily allow the legislature to decide the state’s district maps through 2030, after which the power would return to the independent California Citizens Redistricting Commission. If Prop 50 wins, it could leave as a few as four Republican-held seats across the state after 2026.</p><p>Recent polling shows Prop 50 will likely pass. Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Democrats say Prop 50 is a necessary countermeasure to Republican-led redistricting efforts in Texas.</p><p>However, UC Davis Professor Jim Adams warned a win for the Democrats in the short term could have negative long-term consequences.</p><p>"I think that even if Prop 50 does help the Democrats win a handful of additional seats in California, by winning the battle in California, the Democrats may make themselves lose the war nationally," Adams told Fox.</p><p>Adams, a Democrat, said he agrees with Prop 50 supporters that he wants to see something done to curb Republican redistricting efforts in other parts of the country.</p><p>"There is certainly a visceral satisfaction for the Democrats in feeling that Proposition 50 helps them to fight back. I don’t question the Democrats need to fight back. The question is, are they fighting smart with Proposition 50," he added.</p><p>Prop 50 has the potential to spark political backlash, not only within California Republicans or independents in 2026, but on a national scale during the presidential election in 2028.</p><p>If Prop 50 passes, California’s northern districts risk going from mostly red to completely blue after the midterms.</p><p>Chico, California, sits in Republican-held District 1, which is represented by Rep. Doug LaMalfa. It's one of the districts targeted in Prop 50. The proposed map would likely flip the district by pulling in voters from closer to the more Democrat-leaning Bay Area. </p><p>In 2024, President Donald Trump won Butte County by about 3,000 votes over then-Vice President Kamala Harris. On the streets of downtown Chico, that political split showed when asking voters their feelings on Prop 50.</p><p>Don Tarman and Martin Bettencourt both said they support the proposition, adding that it's a reaction to Trump's presidency.</p><p>"We agree with Gavin Newsom that Trump is trying to sway the election for the House. He picked up supposedly five votes in Texas. We'll see how the vote comes out when we get to the election. But yeah, we’re not Trump fans. I think Gavin Newsom is trying to fight back a little bit," Tarman said.</p><p>Bettencourt said he doesn't typically support redistricting, but this is "a different time."</p><p>"I don’t like redistricting. I think it’s mean to the voters. I think they take away power from them, because they move it around and adjust it," he said. "I think we’re in kind of a different time, so we’re reacting off the top of the ticket, which is the president, and we have to do what we have to do to compensate for that until we get someone better in a position of power."</p><p>Jim Henderson and Eleanor Engelbrecht are among those who don't agree with the proposition – both of them saying that redistricting in California is not an ideal response to the efforts in Texas.</p><p>"When say they do it in Iowa, then do we have to have Oregon do the same thing and the next thing you know everything is being gerrymandered? It’s unfortunate the governor of Texas didn’t recognize that this wasn’t an appropriate way of dealing with the elections, but he made his decision, and I don’t think we should feel compelled to say, well, if you’re gonna do it, we’re gonna do it also," Henderson said.</p><p>Engelbrecht said the country is going through enough change and things need to just "settle."</p><p>"Right now, we’re going through a lot of change already, and I don’t think this is the time we need to be, I don’t know, dusting and cleaning really. I think that we really need to let things settle. I think where our country is at right now, there’s a lot of divide already, and I think really this comes down to defending fair elections," she said.</p><p>If Prop 50 passes, there will likely be a legal battle. California Republicans are already filing lawsuits against the measure.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">US judge vows to rule 'soon' on Abrego Garcia's fate after marathon hearing</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> A federal judge in Maryland on Friday vowed to issue an order "as soon as possible" in a case involving the legal status of Salvadorian migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia and the Trump administration’s plans to deport him from the U.S. to a third country within days — capping an extraordinary marathon hearing in his case that stretched for nearly seven hours — and has dominated headlines and federal court dockets for as many months.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis adjourned the court Friday evening with a promise to order on the matter as quickly as possible. Much of the hearing, however, was punctuated by incredulous objections from Xinis and frequent requests to "sidebar" with lawyers arguing both sides of the case. </p><p>For Xinis, a judge who has presided over various iterations of Abrego's civil case since March, the frequent pauses were a bit of an abberration, which she acknowledged. </p><p>"I’ve always been a proponent of smooth jazz," she quipped.</p><p>Certain portions of the day went far less smoothly. Xinis upbraided the Trump administration for its failure to produce a witness for the court to testify about what steps it had taken to facilitate Abrego Garcia's deportation to a third country, describing the official who appeared on the stand as a witness "who knows less than nothing" about the case, and the countries they are considering removing him to. </p><p>"This appears to be in direct contravention of the court," she noted pointedly, shortly before adjourning for the day.</p><p>Xinis had ordered the evidentiary hearing Monday, with the stated goal of evaluating a request from Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, that he be released from immigration detention pending further action in his case, and to question a Trump administration official with "first-hand" knowledge of the government's efforts to facilitate his deportation to the third country of Eswatini, where Trump officials said they intend to send him.</p><p>Still, the hearing was much more notable for what it failed to produce than what it did. Judge Xinis struggled to clarify seemingly contradictory statements and testimony from Trump officials, including what countries agreed or did not agree to accept Abrego Garcia, and when.</p><p>Lawyers for the Trump administration acknowledged to Xinis that they had previously identified three African countries — Uganda, Ghana, and Eswatini— as suitable third country locations to deport Abrego Garcia, pending dissolution of her emergency order keeping him in the U.S. </p><p>But they mistakenly represented the positions of both Ghana and Eswatini. As of this writing, none of the three governments mentioned agreed to accept Abrego Garcia. </p><p>Xinis honed in on this detail Friday evening. </p><p>"Now that we know Costa Rica is on the table, have there been any conversations about removing him [there]?" she asked Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign, who said that there had not been. </p><p>"Why not?" Xinis pressed. "You don’t want him in the country — you've said that," she said, referring more broadly to the views of the the Trump administration.  "You have a country that will take him. You have a plaintiff who says ‘I’ll go there.'"</p><p>That the government is still pressing for other nations to accept him, she said, is a notion that is a bit "hard to swallow."</p><p>Many of the crucial details emerged after hours of grueling questioning with John Schultz, the deputy assistant director of ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, whom the government produced as its witness.</p><p>Despite his 20 years of experience at DHS, he appeared to know little about the case in question. He failed to answer most of the questions Xinis asked about the government’s plans to deport Abrego Garcia — including basic questions on who within DHS’s ranks had been assigned to handle Abrego Garcia’s case, and the status of various requests for deportation and communications with the countries it had identified.</p><p>Asked if he had been involved at all in Abrego Garcia’s case prior to Tuesday, Schultz said only that he "looked into his case in March," but could not recall "in what capacity."</p><p>Trump officials also told Xinis during court Friday that Eswatini's government had initially declined to accept Abrego Garcia, but that they are currently having "additional discussions" on the matter and had not reached consensus. </p><p>Should Eswatini's government agree to take Abrego Garcia, Trump officials said, they could facilitate a plane to transport him "within 72 hours," pending Xinis's dissolving of her court order requiring Abrego Garcia be kept in the continental U.S.</p><p>The other two countries, Uganda and Ghana, were much clearer in their denials. </p><p>Ghana’s foreign minister, Sam Okudzeto Ablakwa, said on social media Friday morning that his country rejected the U.S. request to accept Abrego Garcia, something he said they "directly and unambiguously conveyed to U.S. authorities."</p><p>Abrego Garcia's lawyer, Andrew Rossman, pointed to the lack of assurances from the three African countries, including the two who have rejected his claim outright. </p><p>The government's goal, Rossman argued, has been to "to identify a series of countries that bear no connection to Abrego Garcia and that have not indicated any willingness to take him." </p><p>Rather, they argued, he should be sent to Costa Rica, the country DHS officials originally offered to send him to in coordination with a guilty plea in a separate criminal case in Nashville, where he was charged with two counts of smuggling.</p><p>Hours after he declined the plea offer, the government sent his lawyers a notice of removal to Uganda. Despite the language of the notice, Uganda's government had not yet been asked to take Abrego Garcia, let alone agree to it. That detail was one of many unearthed, laboriously, over the course of many hours Friday.</p><p>Lawyers for Abrego Garcia, meanwhile, told the court he is "willing and able to board a plane immediately" to go to Costa Rica, if ICE agrees to send him there. </p><p>His attorney, Andrew Rossman, argued that the court should order his release from immigration detention otherwise, arguing that "the government has not and is not currently detaining Mr. Abrego for purposes of effectuating his lawful removal," but rather as a means of punishment.</p><p>The government of Costa Rica agreed to accept Abrego Garcia and outlined certain assurances it provided the U.S. in writing, including granting him refugee status there, and promises not to "refoul" him, or re-deport him to his home country of El Salvador, in keeping with an immigration judge's 2019 court order.</p><p> Xinis, for her part, appeared sympathetic to that view. </p><p>She also expressed new frustration with the Trump administration's lawyers, whom she noted had now twice failed to provide the court with a witness who could speak to Abrego Garcia's case.</p><p>"Prior to Monday, what efforts did the government make to find a third country that would accept Abrego?" Xinis asked Trump administration officials at one point during the hearing. </p><p>As they struggled to answer, she noted in response, "That’s very troubling to me."</p><p>Lawyers for the Trump administration are free to appeal any order from Judge Xinis to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, as DOJ's Ensign indicated they might do shortly before court adjourned. </p><p>Xinis warned later on that the government, in her view, had little margin for error.</p><p>"I'm trying really hard to give you the benefit of the doubt," she told Ensign. But at this point, it's "getting close to "three strikes, you're out."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump declared in 'excellent overall health' by doctor after Walter Reed visit</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump is in "excellent overall health," the president’s doctor said in a memorandum after a follow-up evaluation at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday. </p><p>Earlier this week, the White House announced that Trump, 79, would undergo a "routine" semiannual physical on Friday. </p><p>The president also met with troops while at the hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. </p><p>"President Donald J. Trump successfully completed a scheduled follow-up evaluation at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center," Navy Capt. Sean P. Barbabella, the physician to the president, wrote in a memorandum to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. </p><p>Barbabella said that the visit was part of an ongoing health maintenance plan that included "advanced imaging, laboratory testing and preventative health assessments conducted by multidisciplinary team of specialists." </p><p>He added, "Comprehensive laboratory studies performed in conjunction with the visit were exceptional, including stable metabolic, hematologic and cardiac parameters."</p><p>In his summary, Barbabella said Trump, "remains in exceptional health, exhibiting strong cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, and physical performance." </p><p>Barbabella also said Trump also received updated COVID-19 and flu shots in preparation for international travel. </p><p>"President Trump continues to demonstrate excellent overall health," he wrote, adding that his cardiac age was found to be "approximately 14 years younger than his chronological age. He continues to maintain a demanding daily schedule without restriction." </p><p>The medical checkup will be Trump’s second this year. He had a similar exam in April, during which his physician stated that he "remains in excellent health."</p><p>In July, the president was diagnosed with a vein condition known as chronic venous insufficiency. At the time, Leavitt said Trump had noticed "mild swelling" in his lower legs and was evaluated by the White House medical unit.</p><p>Chronic venous insufficiency occurs when veins in the legs struggle to allow blood to flow back up to the heart.</p><p>Leavitt attributed the bruising on the president’s hand to "frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Joe Flacco reacts to fresh start with Bengals, shares motivation behind drive to compete in NFL</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Joe Flacco will once again wear a different uniform when he takes the field Sunday. Just a few days ago, the Cleveland Browns traded the veteran quarterback to the in-state rival Cincinnati Bengals.</p><p>Cincinnati received Flacco and a sixth-round draft pick in next year's draft, while Cleveland picked up a fifth-round pick in the trade, multiple outlets reported Tuesday. </p><p>On Friday, Flacco spoke to the media for the first time since his arrival in Cincinnati. At one point during the wide-ranging news conference, the Super Bowl winner revealed what keeps him motivated to continue competing in the NFL.</p><p>"You only get a chance to play in the NFL once. I feel like I’ve worked really hard to be a guy that gets to play in the NFL, and I don’t want to take that for granted," the 40-year-old told reporters. "I still feel like I can play the game at a high level, and I want to be able to look at myself in the mirror when I’m 50 years old and say that I gave it everything I had."</p><p>Flacco was named the Bengals' starter for the team's Week 6 matchup with the Green Bay Packers. Flacco reacted to the whirlwind he experienced this week.</p><p>"Crazy business," Flacco said. "You have to be ready for anything. That's kind of what it was. Definitely didn't have this on my list of things that were gonna happen. But, hey, that's this league. And I'm a player. I think most players would say the same thing. I like to play football. If that's in Cincinnati right now, then I'm all for it."</p><p>The Bengals were hoping to solidify their quarterback room after star player Joe Burrow sustained a toe injury in the season opener. Backup Jake Browning struggled when he was thrust into the starting role. Burrow underwent surgery last month but could return to action later this season.</p><p>Flacco said he's been in contact with the injured Burrow.</p><p>"I feel like I have a lot to offer a football team," Flacco added. "I feel like I've put in a lot of work to this point. I feel like I've worked really hard to be a guy that gets to play in the NFL. I still feel like I can play the game at a high level."</p><p>Flacco went 1-3 in his four starts with the Browns this season. But he did guide an underdog Cleveland team to a dramatic comeback victory over the Green Bay Packers. Flacco will meet the Packers for a second time this season on Sunday.</p><p>Dillon Gabriel was named the Browns' starter entering Week 5. Shedeur Sanders was listed as the backup quarterback on the Browns' depth chart after Flacco's move to Cincinnati. The Pittsburgh Steelers host the Browns Sunday.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Secretary of War Pete Hegseth on Friday announced that the Department of War (DOW) is establishing a new counter-narcotics Joint Task Force in the Caribbean Sea. </p><p>Hegseth said the task force’s aim would be to "crush the cartels, stop the poison and keep America safe. The message is clear: if you traffic drugs toward our shores, we will stop you cold."</p><p>The task force is launching at the direction of President Donald Trump, he said, in the SOUTHCOM area, which covers the Caribbean and Latin America. </p><p>The U.S. Southern Command said in a release that the task force was being launched under the II Marine Expeditionary Force on Friday "to synchronize and augment counter-narcotics efforts across the Western Hemisphere."</p><p>"Transnational criminal organizations threaten the security, prosperity, and health of our hemisphere," Admiral Alvin Holsey, the commander of SOUTHCOM, said in a statement. "By forming a JTF around II MEF headquarters, we enhance our ability to detect, disrupt, and dismantle illicit trafficking networks faster and at greater depth – together with our U.S. and partner-nation counterparts."</p><p>This comes as the administration has begun strikes against boats in the Caribbean it says are linked to drug trafficking networks.</p><p>The administration has conducted a series of fatal strikes against four small boats believed to be carrying drugs over the last few months.</p><p>It said 21 people were killed in the strikes.  </p><p>The attacks have alarmed Democratic lawmakers because the administration hasn’t detailed what evidence it had against the targeted boats or their passengers. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Minnesota declines Trump admin's ultimatum to protect girls sports despite pleas from schools and athletes</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump's administration's deadline for Minnesota to amend its transgender athlete laws to protect girls sports came and went Friday, and the state declined the ultimatum during the current government shutdown. </p><p>Attorney General Keith Ellison's office sent a letter to the department's Office for Civil Rights and the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights Friday evening, saying it has no "substantive response" to the Trump administration's demands to keep biological males out of girls sports. Ellison's letter also cited the current government shutdown for its lack of response. </p><p>"The federal government is currently shut down and I understand employees in both Offices for Civil Rights are furloughed. As a result, the Minnesota Department of Education will not provide any substantive response at this time," part of the letter read.</p><p>The deadline was given to the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) and Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL) after a transgender softball pitcher led a girls high school team to a state championship in the spring. But the Trump administration also cited instances of trans athletes competing in girls Alpine skiing, girls Nordic skiing, girls lacrosse, girls track and field team and girls volleyball in Minnesota.</p><p>The letter from Ellison's office also expressed that it was "disappointed that the Joint Letter includes sensitive information about minors in a public document." However, information about the trans softball pitcher has been public for months after the athlete did media interviews. </p><p>Maine and California declined similar ultimatums over the issue from the Trump administration earlier this year. As a result, the Department of Justice launched lawsuits against both of the state's education agencies and school sports leagues. </p><p>Ellison's office's lack of substantive response to the ultimatum comes despite the fact that hundreds of Minnesota school board members penned an open letter urging the state to comply with Trump and change its policies to keep males out of girls sports. </p><p>As of Friday evening, 253 school board members from 105 Minnesota school boards signed the letter, citing concerns for girls' privacy and safety, as well as potential federal funding cuts in response to the state's noncompliance. </p><p>"As recipients of federal financial assistance, failure to correct these violations directly threatens our schools’ ability to serve our students and communities," the letter from the school board members said.</p><p>"Compliance with Title IX is not only a legal obligation but also essential to maintaining the integrity of our educational and athletic programs.</p><p>"Protecting fairness in women’s sports is paramount. The federal determination highlights how permitting males to compete on female teams displaces female athletes from podiums, denies them advancement opportunities, and diminishes their visibility and recognition in competitions. </p><p>"Female students in our districts and across Minnesota deserve equal chances to excel in sports, free from unfair physical advantages that biological differences confer. By entering into the resolution agreement, MDE and MSHSL can ensure equal treatment and foster an environment where female athletes can thrive."</p><p>Ellison has already filed his own lawsuit against Trump and the DOJ for trying to enforce its policies to protect girls sports in Minnesota. He has also bragged about "suing them first" over the issue. </p><p>Meanwhile, the situation involving the softball player has already prompted another lawsuit by three teenage girls who have had to compete against the trans pitcher. </p><p>The lawsuit was filed by three anonymous female athletes against Ellison, Minnesota State High School League Executive Director Erich Martens, Minnesota Department of Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero and Minnesota Commissioner of Education Willie Jett. </p><p>One of the anonymous plaintiffs called out Ellison for supporting the policies that have allowed the trans pitcher to play against females.</p><p>"It’s really upsetting to know that [Ellison] isn’t taking the rights of girls and women seriously. He is allowing boys to compete with girls, and it is not safe and completely unfair," the player previously told Fox News Digital. "To know that AG Ellison is in complete support of letting boys and men take advantage of females in sports is absolutely disgusting and wrong."</p><p>The trans athlete threw a complete-game shutout, allowing just three hits and striking out six in the championship game, capping off a run that saw the trans athlete pitch all 21 innings across three state tournament games, giving up just two runs. The junior allowed just two runs across 35 total innings in the postseason.</p><p>One of the plaintiffs previously told Fox News Digital about what it was like playing against the trans athlete. </p><p>"Hitting against him is not only a physical challenge but a mental, too. It’s a mental battle knowing that he has an advantage in the sport that I grew up playing, making it hard to even want to hit against him," the player said. </p><p>Former White Bear Lake High School softball player Kendall Kotzmacher previously told Fox News Digital that losing to a trans pitcher in the state tournament left her in tears.</p><p>"How do you acknowledge that you lost to a biological male? How do you process those events that happened? And that was something that entire night. I still couldn't do it. … We lost to a biological male in a female state tournament," Kotzmacher said.</p><p>Kotzmacher also pointed out Gov. Tim Walz's history as a high school football coach and seeing the physical prowess of male high school athletes up close. </p><p>"As a coach, you should see the differences and the vast differences that there are between biological males and biological females," Kotzmacher told Fox News Digital. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Democrat prematurely announces Senate campaign launch, but quickly deletes post</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills appeared to announce the launch of her campaign for the Senate on X on Friday, but then quickly deleted the post. </p><p>In a since-deleted announcement video, the 77-year-old Maine governor asked, "Folks, do you want Democrats to take back the Senate? Well, I’m Gov. Janet Mills, and I’m running to flip Maine’s Senate seat blue."</p><p>In the video, Mills took aim at incumbent Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, saying she has "sold out Maine and bowed down to special interests and to Donald Trump, but that ends now."</p><p>The video directed supporters to donate to an ActBlue page that has also since been deleted.</p><p>On the donation page, Mills touted her bona fides, saying, "I’ve spent my career standing up for Maine families as prosecutor, Attorney General, and Governor. I’ve taken on Big Pharma, expanded health care access, and took Donald Trump to court – and won."</p><p>After the posts were deleted, reactions started to flood in online.</p><p>"In a now deleted tweet at 4:30pm on a Friday before a holiday weekend, Janet Mills confirms she is in fact running for Senate … Some poor digital staffer is about to get fired!" posted National Republican Senatorial Committee staffer Joanna Rodriguez.</p><p>A progressive political commentator named Jack Cocchiarella commented, "If you thought democratic politics was missing geriatric candidates with no charisma, wait until you meet 77 year old Janet Mills Chuck Schumer’s pick for Senate. She posted this launch video today then deleted it after two hours."</p><p>Mills’ announcement has been long anticipated. She is seen as the favored candidate by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.</p><p>The top Democrat in the Senate urged Mills to run and sees her as the best candidate to defeat Collins, the only Republican senator up for re-election next year in a state the Democrats carried in the presidential election. A Collins defeat would be essential for the Democrats to have any chance of winning back the Senate majority.</p><p>But before she reaches the general election, Mills first has to navigate a likely competitive and divisive primary among a crowded field of contenders that includes a much younger rising star on the left who's backed by longtime progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.</p><p>Mills, a former elected county district attorney and former state lawmaker, made history serving as Maine's first female attorney general.</p><p>She later won election in 2018 as Maine's first female governor, and, in 2022, she comfortably defeated former Republican Gov. Paul LePage by double digits to win re-election. </p><p>While she will be considered the frontrunner for the Democratic Senate nomination, thanks in part to her vast name recognition in blue-leaning Maine, she could face a serious challenge from 41-year-old Graham Platner, a U.S. Marine, Army veteran and oyster farmer who launched his campaign in August.</p><p>Platner, who hauled in over $3 million in fundraising during the first six weeks after declaring his candidacy, is backed by Sanders, the two-time Democratic presidential nomination runner-up, who recently stopped in Maine to headline a campaign rally.</p><p>In a warning to Mills, Sanders said on social media last week that "Graham Platner is a great working class candidate for Senate in Maine who will defeat Susan Collins."</p><p>"It's disappointing that some Democratic leaders are urging Governor Mills to run. We need to focus on winning that seat &amp; not waste millions on an unnecessary &amp; divisive primary," Sanders added.</p><p>Other candidates vying for the Democratic Senate nomination include Dan Kleban, a co-founder of the Maine Beer Co., and former congressional staffer Jordan Wood, who raked in roughly $3 million during the July-September third quarter of fundraising.</p><p>Phil Rench, a former senior engineer for Elon Musk’s SpaceX, is running as an independent candidate.</p><p>Collins first won election to the Senate in 1996 and won comfortable double-digit re-elections in 2002, 2008 and 2014.</p><p>She chairs the influential Senate Appropriations Committee.</p><p>In her 2020 re-election, Collins faced off against Democratic State House Speaker Sara Gideon in a hotly contested race that became the most expensive in Maine history. While polls indicated Collins trailing her Democratic challenger, she ended up winning the election by more than eight points.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for comment but did not immediately receive a response. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Long-held SCOTUS precedents could undercut Portland, Chicago National Guard lawsuits</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump’s use of the National Guard in Oregon and Illinois faced dual tests in court this week, as his administration argued the two Democrat-led states are obstructing federal immigration enforcement. </p><p>Drawing on a well of constitutional provisions and court precedents, government lawyers have sought to justify deploying the National Guard in Portland and Chicago. Some legal experts say the president has the law on his side, while others worry Trump is threatening state sovereignty.</p><p>Democratic leaders have responded with outrage and indignation to Trump's attempts to send federal troops to their jurisdictions. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson established "ICE-free zones" across Chicago to prevent federal agents from using any city-owned property in their ongoing operations. Conservative critics have compared this action and similar opposition to the Trump administration from Democratic leaders to attempts to nullify federal law, hearkening back to the 19th century. </p><p>"Illinois's own Abraham Lincoln had some ideas about how to deal with this John C. Calhoun-esque ‘nullification,’" attorney and conservative commentator Josh Hammer wrote on X. </p><p>Joshua Blackman, South Texas College of Law professor, said the federal government does not need permission from states to defend federal facilities. The Trump administration's position is that it needs to deploy the National Guard to protect federal personnel and Immigration and Customs Enforcement buildings.</p><p>"This is a principle that goes back to the beginning of the Republic," Blackman told Fox News Digital, pointing to the landmark case McCulloch v. Maryland, which found that Maryland could not tax a national bank created by Congress.</p><p>The high court said in that case that allowing a state to impose such a burden on a federal institution would violate the Constitution's supremacy clause, which says federal law trumps state law.</p><p>During one set of oral arguments this week before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, a Trump administration lawyer argued that unrest in Portland, prompted by ICE activity, justified the deployment of about 200 National Guard soldiers.</p><p>"For months, the ICE facility in Portland and the federal law enforcement officers who work there have faced a steady stream of violence, threats of violence and harassment from violent agitators bent on impeding federal immigration enforcement," said Eric McArthur, arguing for the Justice Department. </p><p>The rebellion statute that Trump is using to federalize the National Guard, which governors have shared authority over, can be invoked in those situations, McArthur argued.</p><p>He also said it was the government's position that the courts had no say over Trump's assessment of the need for the military. Blackman made a similar point.</p><p>"The statute lets the president make the judgment over the need. It's not clear to me that a court can second-guess it," Blackman said.</p><p>In court papers, the Trump administration has also cited a case from 1890, Neagle v. Cunningham, which established that the president has authority under the Constitution’s take care clause to "take care" that federal laws be carried out, including by doing what is necessary to protect those executing immigration laws.</p><p>In Neagle, a U.S. marshal shot and killed a person who attacked a Supreme Court justice, and the Supreme Court found that the State of California could not prosecute the marshal for murder since the marshal was protecting a federal officer.</p><p>Blackman said that states have for years been "frustrating" federal immigration enforcement and that these blue-state lawsuits trying to challenge the National Guard’s presence were an instance of that.</p><p>He said the states' resistance did not "quite rise to the level of nullification," like when states in the South tried to block integration of segregated schools, but that it was "in the ballpark." If states were to defy court orders, that could escalate matters, Blackman said.</p><p>The lawsuits, which could rise to the Supreme Court, especially if the circuit courts were to rule against Trump in the coming days, could help to sharpen the dividing line between state and federal authority over law enforcement.</p><p>Like Oregon and Illinois, Matt Cavedon, a director at the CATO Institute, said the 10th Amendment is also in play in these cases and that it implies that the Trump administration cannot typically take over a state's law enforcement responsibilities.</p><p>Cavedon also said it was unusual, in his view, that a Republican government would adopt a more expanded view of federal power.</p><p>"It's not usually conservatives who are arguing that there are just vast unenumerated federal powers belonging to the president, certainly in the domestic context," Cavedon told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Cavedon said the events in the two states are "really core issues of public security and safety, which are at the heart of what a state's responsibilities are." Oregon and Illinois leaders have made similar claims that nothing extraordinary was playing out crime-wise to warrant National Guard intervention.</p><p>"I think the 10th Amendment answers a question: Any powers that are not conferred on the federal government are reserved to the states, respectively," Cavedon added.</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Reba McEntire is firing back at the use of AI-generated images.</p><p>The "Fancy" singer posted a message on her Instagram stories Thursday to slam the use of AI-generated images in support of fellow country music star Dolly Parton.</p><p>"You tell 'em, Dolly," McEntire wrote. "That AI mess has got us doing all kinds of crazy things. You're out there dying, I'm out here having a baby. Well, both of us know you're too young, and I'm too old for any of that kind of nonsense."</p><p>McEntire was referring to AI-generated images that showed the star, 70, and fiancé Rex Linn posing with an ultrasound photo as Linn cradles McEntire's pregnant stomach.</p><p>Another fake photo making the rounds online recently featured Parton lying in a hospital bed attached to a tube as McEntire sits at her bedside praying and wiping away tears from her eyes.</p><p>Reps for McEntire did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p><p>The image of Parton on her "deathbed" began circulating after Parton announced last month that due to certain "health challenges," her scheduled six-night residency in Las Vegas would be postponed from December 2025 to September 2026.</p><p>In response to the images, Parton posted a video on Instagram telling her followers, "If I was really dying, I don’t think Reba would be the one at my death bed," adding she hopes McEntire "might come visit me earlier."</p><p>The singer's sister, Frieda, further raised concerns about Parton's health when she asked fans to join her in prayer for the songstress.</p><p>"Many of you know she hasn’t been feeling her best lately," Frieda wrote on Facebook. "I truly believe in the power of prayer, and I have been lead to ask all of the world that loves her to be prayer warriors and pray with me." </p><p>Parton took to Instagram earlier this week to dispel rumors she was dying, telling her fans, "I'm not ready to die yet."</p><p>"I didn't take care of myself, so I let a lot of things go that I should have been taking care of," Parton explained. "When I got around to it, the doctor said we need to take care of this, we need to take care of that. Nothing major, but I did have to cancel some things so I could be closer to home, closer to Vanderbilt where I'm kind of having some treatments here and there."</p><p>McEntire also touched on the health concerns Parton alluded to in her recent Instagram story, letting her friend know, "You better know I'm praying for you. I love you with all my heart, and I can't wait to see you soon. Love you!"</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Maine's trans athlete conflict reignited this week with residents taking action at school board meetings. </p><p>During one meeting of the school board in the state's capital of Augusta Wednesday, two women undressed to protest the state's policies that allow biological males to compete in girls sports and use girls locker rooms. </p><p>The stunt came while local parent Nick Blanchard delivered a monologue condemning the school board for enforcing the state's policies on the issue. Blanchard had spoken earlier in the meeting but returned to the lectern at the end of the meeting with the protesting women behind him to carry out the act. </p><p>"I'm about to show you guys how uncomfortable it is for young girls," Blanchard declared to the board members. "You feel uncomfortable? Because that's what these young girls feel like when a boy walks into their locker room and starts unchanging in front of them. Yeah, you feel uncomfortable, right? That's what these young girls feel like every time a young boy changes in front of them."</p><p>The two women continued to remove garments as Blanchard's speech continued. </p><p>"This is Maine's capital. We should be setting an example for the rest of the state. You know what example you guys are setting? That we do not care about the young girls in the rest of the state," he added. </p><p>A similar stunt occurred at a California school board meeting when local women's rights activist Beth Bourne undressed during a speech at a Davis Joint Unified School Board meeting Sept. 18. Bourne was also protesting policies that allow males in girls locker rooms. </p><p>Both California and Maine's state education agencies are being sued by the U.S. Department of Justice for their policies that allow trans athletes in girls sports. </p><p>Multiple individual school districts in both states have passed their own resolutions to support compliance with President Donald Trump's "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" executive order, while Democrat leadership in those states have refused to comply. </p><p>Elswhere in Maine, the RSU 24 School Board adopted one such amendment this past week. </p><p>Republican gubernatorial candidate David Jones spoke at the meeting in support of the resolution. </p><p>"I don’t have anything against people who feel differently about what they are, but in my mind’s eye, and according to God, there is one man and one woman, not two different types of men, not two different types of women. Biology doesn’t lie," Jones said. </p><p>"Don’t let us go backwards. Let’s do what we need to do to protect every single girl in the state of Maine and make sure that they are not hurt in any way shape or form."</p><p>Maine has loosely allowed trans athletes to compete with girls since 2005, when the Maine Human Rights Act prohibited discrimination based on gender identity. </p><p>The Maine Principals' Association (MPA) updated its policies in 2024 to explicitly allow transgender students to compete on teams matching their gender identity. </p><p>The state, particularly its Democratic leadership led by Gov. Janet Mills, is doubling down to defy Trump and protect its trans athletes' rights to compete against girls and share girls locker rooms. </p><p>Many residents, and now school districts, have taken steps to oppose Mills. There have been multiple protests across the state, including two at the state Capitol in August, by activists looking to protect girls from trans competitors. </p><p>A survey by the American Parents Coalition found that, out of about 600 registered Maine voters, 63% said that school sports participation should be based on biological sex, and 66% agreed it is "only fair to restrict women’s sports to biological women."</p><p>The poll also found that 60% of residents would support a ballot measure limiting participationinwomen’s and girls sports tobiological females. This included 64% of independents and 66% of parents with kids under age 18.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Brad Pitt and girlfriend Ines de Ramon have reportedly hit a new relationship milestone after three years together. </p><p>The 61-year-old actor and the 32-year-old jewelry designer are "fully living together," according to a source who spoke with People magazine in a report published Friday. </p><p>"Brad is really including Ines in all his travel plans, and when they are home, they just relax together," the insider said. "They are really making their home into a home."</p><p>Another source told the outlet the couple are "going really strong" and planning for the future.</p><p>"They are happier than ever," the insider said.</p><p>"He's so happy and in love," the source added of Pitt. </p><p>When reached by Fox News Digital for comment, Pitt's representative didn't confirm or deny People's report. </p><p>According to People, the couple moved into a new house after Pitt sold his previous Los Angeles residence. The Real Deal reported that Pitt closed on an off-market deal in September after buying the Los Feliz property for $5.5 million in 2023. </p><p>Pitt's former home was burglarized in June while the actor was away on the promotional tour for his film "F1: The Movie." Pitt purchased a $12 million Hollywood Hills home in August. </p><p>Pitt and de Ramon began dating in 2022 after Pitt's divorce from ex-wife Angelina Jolie. Pitt and Jolie, who share six children, were declared legally single in 2019.</p><p>De Ramon was previously married to "Vampire Diaries" star Paul Wesley, 43. The two married in 2019 but announced their separation in September 2022. "The decision to separate is mutual and occurred five months ago," a representative told People at the time.  </p><p>The former couple, who do not share any children together, finalized their divorce in March 2024. </p><p>De Ramon often joined Pitt on his press tour for "F1: The Movie," and the two marked their first public appearance at the 2024 British Grand Prix, a Formula 1 race. </p><p>In a May interview with GQ, Pitt laughed off a question about whether he and de Ramon deliberately decided to make their first joint appearance at an F1 event as a strategic move to promote the actor's movie. </p><p>"No, dude, it’s not that calculated," Pitt said with a laugh. "If you’re living, oh my God, how exhausting would that be? If you’re living with making those kinds of calculations? No, life just evolves. Relationships evolve."</p><p>The couple made their red carpet debut during the Venice Film Festival in September 2024, when they attended the premiere of Pitt's movie "Wolfs," in which he co-starred with George Clooney. While on the red carpet, the pair posed for photos with Clooney and wife Amal Clooney. </p><p>In June, Pitt made rare comments about his relationship with de Ramon while the couple enjoyed a date night at the London premiere for the actor's film "F1: The Movie."</p><p>As Pitt stepped out on the red carpet, a reporter asked him how it felt to have his girlfriend’s support. Pitt replied to Access Hollywood with a big smile, "Well sure, of course – you know, it takes two."</p><p>According to People magazine, de Ramon was a major source of support for Pitt as he was grieving the loss of his mother, Jane Etta Pittt, who died at the age of 84 in August. </p><p>"She wants to be there for him, and Brad is very much letting her be that person," the insider told the outlet at the time. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">High school football team travels 500 miles only to get pepper sprayed by police after loss</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A high school football game ended in chaos after police deployed pepper spray in an effort to defuse verbal and physical altercations.</p><p>The Cardinal Ritter College Prep High School football team from St. Louis traveled nearly 500 miles to Massillon, Ohio, and it turned into a nightmare of a trip.</p><p>Cardinal Ritter fell to Massillon High School 28-14 in what was said to be a chippy, physical game all night.</p><p>Tensions boiled over during the postgame handshake, when multiple players had to be separated, prompting the use of pepper spray.</p><p>Police said the officers involved "operated within our policies and procedures."</p><p>"Our task was to ensure the safety and security of all those who enter the stadium, which includes fans, students and athletes alike. Unfortunately, the conclusion of the game brought with it multiple physical altercations on the field between both teams," the police said in a release. </p><p>The release then explained why the pepper spray was used.</p><p>"Team staff members, coaches and Massillon police officers were forced to intervene and separate players during the post-game ‘hand-shake.’ Officers gave lawful orders on multiple occasions for Cardinal Ritter players to leave the field and head toward their locker room," the release continued.</p><p>"The verbal commands were an attempt to de-escalate the pushing and shoving occurring. Those commands were ignored. At one point during the incident, a Massillon player’s facemask was grabbed; he was surrounded, and then chased by Cardinal Ritter players. Officers once again ordered the visiting team off the field. All of this was transpiring while the Massillon marching band and cheerleaders were now on the field for the ceremonial post-game playing of the school’s alma mater. This factor concerned officers as they continued to order Ritter players off the field.</p><p>"The Ritter players again charged at Massillon players who were now near the band. This was an unfortunate and difficult situation for officers, who, during the entirety of the incident, attempted to restore order. Ultimately, two Massillon police officers deployed pepper spray, which was effective. We have thoroughly reviewed this incident and found they operated within our policies and procedures for the use-of-force action taken."</p><p>Cardinal Ritter officials told Fox 8 in Cleveland they have contacted the Ohio High School Athletic Association to see what action they could take.</p><p>"We are aware of the incident that occurred at the Massillon, OH, football game last week, and we were very troubled by a video of what happened," Cardinal Ritter’s president Tamiko Armstead said in a statement.</p><p>Current Detroit Lions wide receiver Jameson Williams attended Cardinal Ritter. Paul Brown, the co-founder of the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals, also attended Massillon.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Legal expert calls out 'ironic' twist as NY AG who prosecuted Trump faces federal bank fraud charges</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is facing federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution.</p><p>George Washington University law professor and Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley highlighted the irony of the charges, noting they follow James’ years-long prosecution of President Donald Trump on similar grounds.</p><p>"What’s really ironic is she just asked for half a billion dollars of damages against Trump in a case where no one lost any money. In fact, the bank made money," Turley told "America Reports" on Friday. </p><p>"In this case, the government's alleging that she made serious money, that by misrepresenting the status of this property, she made thousands of dollars."</p><p>James faces one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. According to the indictment, she falsely claimed a Virginia home was her personal second residence to secure favorable loan terms, while actually renting it out.</p><p>Trump has previously called for Justice Department action against James, something Turley said may hinder the case. </p><p>Turley suggested that moving forward, James may claim to be the target of "vindictive prosecution" and "selective prosecution." He said Trump’s social media posts urging the DOJ to take action will likely be a central piece of evidence in their defense.  </p><p>Turley also noted he believes the odds will favor James. He said her legal team is likely to challenge the appointment of the acting U.S. attorney who signed off on the charges.</p><p>"James is likely to say that the acting U.S. attorney who signed off on these charges was not appropriately appointed and therefore should not have held that office," Turley explained. </p><p>"If that is the case, then the indictment would go down."</p><p>James and her supporters have framed the charges as politically motivated.</p><p>"He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State attorney general," James said in a video posted online.</p><p>New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani called the prosecution "an attack on our city" and "a blatant miscarriage of justice." </p><p>Turley questioned why similar outrage was not expressed during James’ prosecution of Trump.</p><p>"I don't remember Mamdani coming out and denouncing James when she ran for office on the pledge to nail Donald Trump for something, not even specifying what it might be," he said.</p><p>"None of these people were objecting to any of that lawfare."</p><p>James’ 2018 campaign for New York Attorney General included a promise to pursue Trump. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Mamdani says Colbert show shocked him when producer pitched 'game' to discuss Israel-Hamas war</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Democratic New York City mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani said Stephen Colbert's "The Late Show" pitched a "game" to play that he found inappropriate. </p><p>In an interview with The New Yorker, Mamdani recalled an exchange with Colbert's producers ahead of his late-night appearance in June, just one day before the self-described democratic socialist clinched the Democratic nomination. </p><p>At the time, Jewish groups urged Colbert to grill Mamdani on his views about Israel.</p><p>"Right before the candidates went onstage, the producers appeared in the greenroom and said that they wanted to go over a few more questions," The New Yorker described the situation Thursday. "According to people who were in the room, one of the producers suggested a ‘thumbs-up or thumbs-down’ segment: ‘Thumbs-up or thumbs-down: Hamas. Thumbs-up or thumbs-down: a Palestinian state.’"</p><p>"Mamdani’s face dropped. ‘I just couldn’t believe what was happening," Mamdani told the magazine. ’That a genocide could be distilled into a late-night game.'"</p><p>Mamdani's aides were "incensed," one of them telling the producer, "You have the first Muslim candidate for mayor in the history of New York. … You don’t want to ask him a question about that?"</p><p>A spokesperson for "The Late Show" did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. </p><p>Colbert did press Mamdani for several minutes on the Israel-Hamas war and the growing concerns about antisemitism. </p><p>"Does the State of Israel have the right to exist?" Colbert asked.</p><p>"Yes," Mamdani responded. "Like all nations, I believe it has the right to exist and a responsibility also to uphold international law."</p><p>The liberal late-night host, who repeatedly stressed he wasn't offering any endorsement in the mayoral race, acknowledged the "elephant in the room," noting the "fear" within the Jewish community about the rise in antisemitism and what would happen if New York City elected Mamdani, a far-left Muslim and an outspoken critic of Israel. </p><p>"They're very upset by some of the things that you've said in the past, and they're afraid that your mayorship would actually lead to increased antisemitism, that they believe that would be more dangerous for them," Colbert told Mamdani. "What do you say to those New Yorkers who are afraid that you wouldn't be their mayor, that you wouldn't protect them?"</p><p>"You know, I know where that fear is coming from," Mamdani responded. "It's a fear that is based upon the horrific attacks we've seen in Washington, D.C., in Boulder, Colorado, and it's a fear that I hear also from New Yorkers themselves."</p><p>"You know, just a few days after the horrific war crime of Oct. 7, a friend of mine told me about how he went to his synagogue for Shabbat services, and he heard the door open behind him. And a tremor went up his spine as he turned around not knowing who was there and what they meant for him," he continued. </p><p>"I spoke to a Jewish man in Williamsburg just months ago who told me that the door he left unlocked for decades is now one that he locks. And, ultimately, this is because we're seeing a crisis of antisemitism."</p><p>Mamdani then touted his proposal committing an "800%" increase in funding for the Department of Community Safety's anti-hate crime programming. </p><p>"Because to your point, antisemitism is not simply something that we should talk about. It's something that we have to tackle," Mamdani told Colbert. "We have to make clear there's no room for it in this city, in this country, in this world and — "</p><p>"And no justification for violence of any kind?" Colbert interjected.</p><p>"No," Mamdani quickly responded. "There's no room for violence in this city, in this country, in this world."</p><p>Polls show Mamdani maintaining a substantial lead over his rivals even as the mayoral race narrowed following the exit of incumbent New York City Mayor Eric Adams.</p><p>The 33-year-old assembly member has 46% support among likely voters, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll. His nearest rival, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has shrunk the gap but still trails at 33% support, while Guardian Angels co-founder Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate, places a distant third with 15%.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">NFL reviewing Giants handling of concussion protocol after Brian Daboll's tense exchange with team doctor</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The third start of rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart's career was undoubtedly his best. The rookie threw for 195 yards in the New York Giants 34-17 win over the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>But before Dart could officially celebrate the second victory of his NFL career, the 22-year-old entered the medical tent to be evaluated for a possible concussion. Russell Wilson, who was the Giants' starter for the first three games, briefly entered Thursday night's game.</p><p>Giants head coach Brian Daboll became visibly upset once Dart left the game. The team's head physician, Dr. Scott A. Rodeo, then got caught in the crosshairs.</p><p>Daboll appeared to scream at Dr. Rodeo during a heated exchange while other medical personnel checked Dart for a head injury. The rookie quarterback missed just two plays before returning to action.</p><p>Nevertheless, the NFL decided to take a closer look into the team's application of the concussion protocol, ESPN reported Friday. Daboll later issued an apology for his role in the tense moment with Dr. Rodeo.</p><p>"If you’ve ever been on an NFL sideline, there’s a lot of emotions," Daboll said after the game. "There’s a lot of emotions. And I certainly am an emotional guy. I apologized directly to our team physician. I just wanted his a-- out there if he was OK. </p><p>"But I wanted the process — like, we were getting ready to go for it on a potential fourth down. I would have burned a timeout if he could have came out there. So, I was asking how long is it gonna take?"</p><p>At one point during Dart's time with the medical staff, Daboll entered the tent to presumably check on the young quarterback. Giants President and CEO John Mara said he had a conversation with Daboll about his actions during the game.</p><p>"I spoke to Coach Daboll this morning about approaching the medical tent last night. While I firmly believe, as he has stated, that he was not trying to influence the process in any way, he understands the appearance of going to the tent is inappropriate," Mara said in a statement.</p><p>"We have protocols in place as a league to ensure player safety, and we need to allow our medical staff to execute those protocols without interference. We understand the situation is under review by the NFL and the NFLPA, and obviously we will cooperate fully."</p><p>Daboll said he respects the medical staff and reiterated his apology.</p><p>"So, again, you want your guy out there, not at risk of anything else. But, you know, he came out. ‘I think he’s gonna be good.’ I’m like, ‘Is he gonna be good or not? I’m gonna call a timeout on fourth down and go for this son of a b----.’ You know what I mean? So, I love our doctors. … I apologize. I was in the wrong."</p><p>The Giants have won two of their past three games. Meanwhile, the Eagles have dropped two straight.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A'ja Wilson scored 31 points, Chelsea Gray and Jackie Young both added 18, and the Las Vegas Aces won their third WNBA championship in four seasons, beating the Phoenix Mercury 97-86 on Friday night for a four-game sweep of the Finals.</p><p>The Aces made quick work of the league's first best-of-seven Finals. It was another offensive onslaught from Las Vegas, which scored 54 points in the first half and averaged more than 90 points per game in the series.</p>
<p>Wilson — <span class="link">a four-time MVP</span> — was in the middle of the action once again, even if she didn't have the best shooting night. She finished 7 of 21 from the field, but made 17 of 19 free throws. Gray made four 3-pointers, including two in the fourth quarter to help turn back a final rally by the Mercury.</p><p>The Aces led 76-62 going into the fourth quarter, but the Mercury went on an 8-0 run early that cut the deficit to 76-70 with 7:56 left. That was as close as they would get.</p><p>Kahleah Copper led the Mercury with 30 points, shooting 12 of 22 from the field. Alyssa Thomas had 17 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.</p>
<p>Mercury coach Nate Tibbetts was ejected in the third quarter after receiving two quick technical fouls from official Gina Cross.

<div class="article-title">Trump has "routine yearly checkup" 6 months after annual physical exam</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington</em> — President Trump visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Friday morning for what the White House said was his "routine yearly checkup," just six months after undergoing his annual physical examination at the same facility. </p><p>According to a memo obtained by CBS News Friday evening, written by the president's physician, Capt. Sean Barbabella, Mr. Trump "successfully completed a scheduled follow-up evaluation." </p><p>Barbabella stated that the president underwent "advanced imaging, laboratory testing, and preventive health assessments," adding that "comprehensive laboratory studies performed in conjunction with the visit were exceptional, including stable metabolic, hematologic, and cardiac parameters."</p><p>The president also received his annual flu vaccination, and an updated COVID-19 booster vaccination.</p><p>"President Trump continues to demonstrate excellent overall health," Barbabella wrote. "His cardiac age-a validated measure of cardiovascular vitality via ECG-was found to be approximately 14 years younger than his chronological age."</p>
<p>The president spent several hours at the medical center Friday, meeting with troops while he was there. </p><p>When previously asked, the White House declined to explain why the president was undergoing a second yearly checkup. Mr. Trump, 79, plans to travel to the Middle East as soon as this weekend, after he announced the <span class="link">first phase</span> of a peace deal between Israel and Hamas. </p><p>Ahead of the appointment, the president described his visit as a "sort of semi-annual physical, which I do."</p><p>"I think I'm in great shape, but I'll let you know," the president told reporters Thursday. "... Physically, I feel very good. Mentally, I feel very good."</p>
<p>The president is able to receive basic medical care at the White House from the physician to the president, but presidents typically go to Walter Reed for more extensive examinations and procedures. </p><p>The president's <span class="link">annual physical results</span> as released by the White House in April showed no abnormalities, aside from minor sun damage — and scarring "on the right ear from a gunshot wound" — a result of the <span class="link">assassination attempt</span> against him in July 2024. His April records also say that he had a colonoscopy in July 2024 and was recommended to undergo another in 2027. </p>
<p>After the president was seen with swollen ankles at the FIFA Club World Cup and a bruised hand on multiple occasions, Leavitt in July told the press that according to the readout from the president's April exam, his health was normal. The latest full exam by the White House Medical Unit, however, <span class="link">revealed</span> the president has chronic venous insufficiency. </p>
<p>According to Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic, <span class="link">chronic venous insufficiency</span> occurs when veins in the legs do not function normally, leading to poor blood flow back up to the heart. Barbabella said that an examination revealed no evidence of a more serious condition such as deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease, and the president remains in "excellent" overall health. The White House has said the president's bruised hand is a result of the extensive handshaking that's part of his job. </p>

<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Just before an Israel-Hamas ceasefire went into effect Friday, which is the first step in implementing phase one of President Trump's peace <span class="link">plan to end the war in Gaza</span>, senior U.S. officials shared a timeline of the monthslong effort to put the deal together.</p><p>At this point, Israeli troops have <span class="link">withdrawn</span> from parts of Gaza, initiating a 72-hour countdown for Hamas to release all remaining Israeli hostages. In exchange, Israel will release dozens of Palestinian prisoners and allow aid to flow into Gaza. Palestinians who left northern Gaza during fighting there could be seen returning to the war-ravaged area Friday.</p><p>The vast majority of Mr. Trump's <span class="link">20-point plan</span> remains to be implemented, but as the work of fulfilling it begins, here's what senior U.S. officials have told CBS News about key moments in the negotiations.</p><h2>August 2025: Hamas accepts new ceasefire proposal</h2><p>Hamas accepted a new Gaza ceasefire proposal presented by Egypt and Qatar. One U.S. official said this proposal drew upon principles from earlier negotiations and previous hostage releases. It also took into consideration elements of what Israel, Hamas and Mr. Trump wanted to be included. It was this proposal that would evolve into the 20-point plan.</p><h2>Around Monday, Sept. 22 through Wednesday, Sept. 24: Witkoff, Kushner bring 20-point plan to Qataris to "tighten it up"</h2><p>In New York during the United Nations General Assembly, special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and outside Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner brought the 20-point plan to the Qataris, in particular, to Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, with whom they worked to "wordsmith the document, to tailor it, to tighten it up," a senior U.S. official said. Afterward, they brought the document to other Arab leaders to get feedback.</p>
<p>The senior official said negotiators met with Turkey and Egypt, in addition to Qatar. On Tuesday, Sept. 23, during his day at the United Nations General Assembly, President Trump presented the 20-point plan to a roundtable of Arab leaders, which elicited "a lot of feedback."</p><h2>Wednesday, Sept. 24 through Sunday, Sept. 28: Witkoff, Kushner draft plan that includes Netanyahu apology to Qatar for airstrike in Doha</h2><p>Witkoff and Kushner stayed in New York City after the U.N. General Assembly, working through the weekend to put together a plan to present to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office on Monday, Sept. 29.</p><p>Their plan included an apology from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Mohammed, the Qatari prime minister, for an Israeli strike that killed Hamas officials in Doha in September. "It all went well," a senior U.S. official said.</p><h2>Monday, Sept. 29: Netanyahu's apology to Qatar </h2><p>Mr. Trump announced the 20-point proposal during a meeting with Netanyahu at the White House. That day, the president, Netanyahu and the Qatari prime minister spoke on a phone call, and Netanyahu apologized for Israel's strikes on Doha, expressing "his deep regret that Israel's missile strike against Hamas targets in Qatar unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman," according to a White House readout of the call.</p>
<p>The Israeli strike had caused "a lot of angst within the Arab world" and there was "deep mistrust between the parties," a senior U.S. official said, adding that Netanyahu's apology to Qatar was well received, "as something really, really strong and the sort of thing that mature people do." </p><p>"That got us some leverage," the official added.</p><p>Around this time, an official said the U.S. began to detect Hamas "had had enough." </p><p>"Every family in Gaza has been affected by this," the official said. "You read some of the public opinion of polls — the Gazans do not just blame Israel for this conflict. They, in large part, were blaming Hamas for it. We began to sense that turn in leverage."</p><p>Within days, there would be a meeting in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, with the Turkish and Egyptian intelligence chiefs and the Qatari prime minister. </p><h2>Friday, Oct. 3: in Miami, Kushner, Witkoff work on hostage releases</h2><p>In Florida, when Kushner heard Hamas had agreed to start talks on hostage releases, he drove 20 minutes to Witkoff's home in Miami, where they worked and fielded calls about the peace proposal, two administration officials said.</p><h2>Sunday, Oct. 5 - Monday, Oct. 6: Meetings in Sharm El Sheikh bring Hamas and Israel to the table</h2><p>Officials from Turkey, Qatar and Egypt sat down with Hamas and Israel at the table in Sharm El Sheikh on Oct. 5. Witkoff and Kushner set off for Sharm El Sheikh once they felt the tactical teams "had done quite a bit."</p>
<h2>Wednesday morning, Sharm El Sheikh, Oct. 8: Refining the peace plan</h2><p>Kushner and Witkoff arrived in Sharm El Sheikh at 6:30 a.m. local time and "immediately went to work," according to one senior U.S. official. They spent "a lot of time" going over proposals and issues that had arisen over the previous days, such as the redeployment of the Israel Defense Forces and when the hostage releases would take place.</p><p>During these talks, they also separated the peace deal into two phases. Phase one would be a hostage release, including the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel.</p><p>Then, phase two would begin. This was what one senior U.S. official called an "almost permanent ceasefire" that would be in place until other issues were negotiated: the decommissioning of arms, how a technocratic government would enter and run Gaza, how the Israeli army would redeploy and what the gating mechanisms for these steps would be.</p><p>Before they left, Mr. Trump relayed multiple messages to Kushner and Witkoff. </p><p>"His message was, 'First, get it done,'" a U.S. official said. He also reiterated that he stood behind every aspect of his 20-point plan. </p><p>"POTUS wanted people on both sides to understand that he was going to enforce good conduct here, and that was a critical and overarching message that we were there to talk about," this official said. </p><p>"We were going for, you know, 20 straight hours," one official said of the talks in Egypt.</p>
<h2>Sharm El Sheikh, Oct. 8, Wednesday evening: "Serious breakthroughs"</h2><p>"We began to have some very, very serious breakthroughs with regard to all of these issues," the U.S. official said, prompting another meeting Wednesday night with Kushner, Witkoff and Middle East officials. </p><p>After settling what both sides saw as consequential issues that were discussed by both sides, and clearing up some "misconceptions and miscommunications," Kushner and Witkoff made a call to the president and received some directions from him. Mr. Trump called into the talks at least three times on either Witkoff's or Kushner's iPhone, and spoke on speaker with multiple stakeholders.</p><p>One of the key breakthroughs that evening was reaching consensus on the release of the 20 living Israeli hostages and the swap for the Palestinian prisoners. </p><p>"People became more malleable. You could see it as we were trust-building. Food was coming in. We were exchanging ideas," one U.S. official said. "I can't stress enough how important this physical interaction was. We had multiple Arab leaders there who, I think, became very, bought into the fact that we really wanted to see a deal. We were committed to it, and we were going to stand behind it."</p><p>At this time, Hamas began to realize "they didn't need the hostages necessarily to enforce a view of theirs, that it was better for them to concede that a release was a positive thing, that better things would happen as a result of that decision on their part," a U.S. official said.</p><p>"It was so comprehensive, the engagement, so interactive. We just got ourselves to that place, and then everybody could see the line, and they wanted to cross it. Everybody. It really became a unanimous thing," this official added.</p><h2>5:30 p.m., Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 8 (2:30 a.m., Sharm El Sheikh, Thursday, Oct. 9): Announcing the deal</h2><p>Witkoff and Kushner felt they had dealt with all the issues and were ready to announce the deal. President Trump <span class="link">announced</span> it in the U.S. on Truth Social.</p>
<p>"This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America," the president wrote on Truth Social. "BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!"</p><p>Witkoff and Kushner then traveled to Cairo, and met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to tell him he was needed for the implementation phase. After the El-Sisi meeting, Witkoff and Kushner flew to Tel Aviv.</p><h2>6:30p, Tel Aviv, Thursday, Oct. 9: Witkoff, Kushner met with applause in Cabinet room</h2><p>Witkoff and Kushner arrive in Tel Aviv, though they never made it to their hotel. They immediately went to see President Isaac Herzog, to walk him through the plan, and then met with Netanyahu. They also spoke to the Israeli Cabinet, receiving a warm welcome. </p><p>In the Cabinet room, "everybody started clapping," a U.S. official said. "There were plenty of differences of opinion that we heard there. There were hardliners, there were people who wanted to see the 20 hostages come home above all else, but we talked, and we explored different pathways to get to good compromises."</p><p>Their reason for going to Israel was to ensure "implementation occurs." Another senior U.S. official acknowledged, "There's still just a lot of ways that this can go wrong." </p><p>"So, we're staying on top of the details to make sure everyone fulfills their obligations and that any misunderstandings are quickly discussed and adjudicated," the official said.</p><p>A U.S. official suggested Mr. Trump may have succeeded in reaching a deal where other leaders failed because "he's not trying to be a middle-of-the-roader."</p>
<p>"He's basically stood shoulder to shoulder with Israel 100%," the official said. This has meant Israel "has a lot of trust in him that he's not going to ask them to do anything that would compromise their security. And because they know that if they agree together on what the end state should be, President Trump and his team were able to have much more frank and creative conversations with Israel on how to get there."</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Maria Corina Machado told CBS News on Friday that <span class="link">being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize</span> serves as a message to her fellow Venezuelans that "we are not alone."</p><p>"They have been part of this huge movement," Machado told CBS News by Zoom. "We are not alone. The world recognizes this huge, epic fight." </p><p>Machado is the leader of the pro-democracy movement in Venezuela, which is under a dictatorship so brutal she has been forced to live in hiding.</p><p>"This is certainly the biggest recognition to our people," Machado told CBS News, which was the only U.S. media outlet to speak to her following Friday's announcement. </p><p>Known as Venezuela's "Iron Lady," the 58-year-old Machado has led a massive political movement challenging the country's authoritarian leaders for over two decades.</p>
<p>First, she challenged former President Hugo Chavez, and now, his successor, President Nicolas Maduro, whose <span class="link">disputed July 2024 reelection</span> was not recognized by the U.S., <span class="link">which instead declared</span> opposition leader Edmundo González, <span class="link">now exiled</span>, as the winner.</p><p>For the past several months, the Trump administration <span class="link">has placed pressure</span> on Maduro's regime, deploying warships to the southern Caribbean and conducting military strikes on alleged drug boats it says originated from Venezuela.  </p><p>Last week, the White House <span class="link">notified Congress</span> that the U.S. was in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations.</p><p>Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for keeping "the flame of democracy burning amidst a growing darkness," the Norwegian Nobel Committee said Friday in a statement.</p>
<p><span class="link">A video captured</span> the emotional moment Machado accepted the award in a phone call from Kristian Berg Harpviken, the director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute. </p><p>"Oh my God. I have no words. Thank you so much," Machado said on the call. "I hope you understand this is a movement, this is an achievement for a whole society. I am just one person; I certainly do not deserve this. Oh my God."</p><p>Machado's defiance has come at a price. She has spent the last year in hiding after Maduro repeatedly threatened to arrest her.</p><p>CBS News was with Machado in Venezuela last year during the presidential elections, when Maduro claimed victory despite the international outcry of fraud.</p><p>Maduro's crackdown on dissent escalated, but that didn't stop her. </p><p>"I think it does give me a lot of protection," said Machado of how receiving the Nobel may have changed her future and her security situation. "But the most important thing, is that it highlights, worldwide, the importance of the struggle of Venezuela."</p><p>Machado told CBS News she spoke to President Trump on Friday and thanked him "from the bottom of the heart of Venezuelans."</p>
<p>She said she told Mr. Trump that he can "be sure that we are a society committed to freedom, that we will prevail."</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump unveils deal for AstraZeneca to cut Medicaid drug prices and join "TrumpRx" site</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca will offer U.S. patients discounted prices for some prescription drugs, President Trump announced Friday, the second major drug company to strike a deal with the Trump administration in recent weeks.</p><p>Under the deal, AstraZeneca will offer its drugs to Medicaid patients at "most-favored-nation" prices, meaning the U.K.-based drugmaker will charge no more than the lowest rate offered in other high-income countries, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a Friday afternoon Oval Office event. AstraZeneca also promised to offer new prescription drugs at most-favored-nation rates, Oz said.</p><p>AstraZeneca will also list "all primary care medications" on a government website called TrumpRx, and it will offer discounts for some drugs, including lung disease medication, according to Oz. The company said in a statement that it will offer drugs at up to an 80% discount for "eligible patients with prescriptions for chronic diseases."</p><p>TrumpRx — which is set to launch early next year — will not sell drugs directly, but will instead direct consumers to lower prices elsewhere, Oz said. AstraZeneca said the website will allow patients to buy drugs directly from the company at a "reduced cash price."</p><p>The AstraZeneca announcement came less than two weeks after Pfizer <span class="link">reached a similar deal</span> to offer most-favored-nation rates to Medicaid patients and list drugs on TrumpRx.</p>
<p>Policymakers have struggled with high prescription drug prices for decades. Members of both parties have floated proposals to tie drug prices to the typically much lower rates offered in other countries, but the idea <span class="link">faces legal impediments</span>, and drugmakers have argued that price controls could make it harder for them to invest in research.</p><p>Mr. Trump has <span class="link">pressed some of the largest pharmaceutical companies</span> to voluntarily offer drugs to Medicaid patients and new drugs at most-favored-nation rates, floating tighter regulations if companies do not comply. Separately, Mr. Trump has threatened 100% tariffs on pharmaceuticals unless drugmakers are in the process of building U.S.-based plants. AstraZeneca on Friday announced plans to invest in U.S. manufacturing and research facilities.</p><p>But questions remain about how the president's deals with drugmakers will work, and who will feel the difference at the pharmacy counter, some experts caution.</p><p>Most-favored-nation pricing could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, experts say, because the program already has a statutory "best price" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.</p>
<p>"Medicaid already enjoys 'best-price' protection in the sense that they receive the lowest prices charged to any commercial payer in the United States. Therefore, we are starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market," Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, <span class="link">told CBS News</span> in reaction to the Pfizer deal.</p><p>It's also unclear how many people would benefit from TrumpRx. For uninsured patients or those with high deductibles, such an option could matter, if their prescriptions are among those listed. But most people obtain their medications through insurance.</p><p>"The direct-to-patient stuff is, in my view, a sideshow and branding opportunity for Trump," Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, told CBS News following the Pfizer agreement. "Most patients have drug coverage. … Very few are going to buy medications with cash, unless the drug is not a covered benefit, like weight loss or erectile dysfunction drugs."</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</em> — The Academy of Classical Christian Studies high school girls basketball team in Oklahoma City returned to the court this week, their first practice since last season's division championship game, where they hit a buzzer-beater against Apache High School that both ended the game, and started it all. </p><p>After seemingly winning the title in the Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association, Academy head coach Brendan King went home that same night and watched the game tape. At one point in the game, there had been some confusion about the scoreboard.  </p><p>"As soon as I walked out of the locker room, my stomach kind of turned into knots. And I said, 'I'm going to need to know if we really won this game or not,'" King told CBS News. </p><p>So, just to be sure, he recounted every basket and discovered his team had actually lost. The game had ended with Academy winning 44-43, but King discovered the true score should have been 43-42, with Apache High coming out on top. </p><p>"It really tore me to pieces," King said. "It really did." </p>
<p>Technically, it didn't matter because league rules state that once a game is done, the score is the score, there's no changing it.  </p><p>But King decided to tell his team anyway. And when they heard what had happened, the consensus was unanimous.</p><p>"It would have felt wrong, I think, to have taken the trophy, regardless," one Academy player told CBS News. </p><p>"It was a really good teaching moment for us to just be, like, this is not the whole point," another Academy player added. </p>
<p> So, the Academy High team made the unprecedented decision to appeal their own crowning victory. They asked that it be taken away and awarded to their competition, Apache High. The league agreed, and King hand-delivered the championship plaque.</p><p>"Just really special that he came out and did that," an Apache High player said. </p><p>Apache head coach Amy Merriweather says her team is glad to have the title, but even happier for the hope that came with it. </p><p>"It showed us, you know, there are still good people in this world," Merriweather said. "It's something we'll always remember."</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump announces extra 100% tariff on Chinese goods starting next month</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump said Friday he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China starting next month, citing new Chinese export controls — marking a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. </p><p>The new 100% tariffs will add on to any existing import taxes on Chinese goods, the president wrote in a Truth Social post. Tariffs on Chinese imports <span class="link">currently stand at 30%</span>. Mr. Trump said the U.S. will also impose export controls on "any and all critical software" starting next month.</p><p>The tariffs could be imposed on Nov. 1 or sooner, "depending on any further actions or changes taken by China," Mr. Trump said. </p><p>The president's announcement came hours after he <span class="link">threatened steeper duties</span> on China. He pointed to new Chinese rules that require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths from China, even if they were manufactured outside of the country. China mines and processes most of the world's rare earth metals, which are <span class="link">critical minerals</span> used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.</p><p>"It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History," the president wrote in his Friday message announcing the tariffs, calling China's export controls "extraordinarily aggressive" and a "moral disgrace."</p>
<p>Separately on Friday, China <span class="link">imposed port fees</span> on U.S.-owned ships that dock in the country, retaliating against what Beijing called a "discriminatory" U.S. port fee on Chinese ships.</p><p>Major stock indexes <span class="link">fell sharply on Friday</span> after Mr. Trump's initial tariff threat. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 3.6%.</p><p>The new tariffs and export restrictions could inflame trade talks between China and the Trump administration. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month, but the U.S. president said earlier Friday "there seems to be no reason" for the meeting to take place.</p><p>China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. importing $438.9 billion worth of Chinese goods and China buying $143.5 billion in U.S. goods last year, according to federal statistics. </p>
<p>But China and the U.S. have had a rocky relationship on trade in recent months. Over the spring, American tariffs on Chinese goods <span class="link">spiked to 145%</span> and Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports soared to 125%, following a set of tit-for-tat hikes that began with import duties unveiled by the Trump administration. In May, the U.S. and China <span class="link">agreed to slash</span> their tariffs to 30% and 10%, respectively, while the two sides pursued a broader trade deal.</p><p>The U.S.-China economic relationship has other complexities, too. The Trump administration needs Beijing's permission to close a <span class="link">deal to transfer ownership</span> of TikTok's U.S. operations away from China-based parent company ByteDance. China has <span class="link">also chafed</span> at some of the administration's restrictions on international students.  </p>

<div class="article-title">Stocks slump after Trump threatens to hit China with more tariffs</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Investors are shuddering on concerns of renewed trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies. </p><p>Stocks fell sharply on Friday, with the S&amp;P 500 shedding 183 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6,553 in what was the index's worst day since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 879 points, or 1.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.6%. </p><p>The selloff affected a wide range of stocks, from Big Tech companies like Nvidia and Apple to stocks of smaller companies looking to get past uncertainty about tariffs and trade.</p><p>"Investors still think the tit-for-tat between the U.S. and China these last few days is mostly posturing (the consensus view is that tariffs won't go up, and that Trump and Xi will still meet in South Korea), but trade-related risks have certainly risen after being dormant for the last several weeks," Wall Street analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a report. </p><p>Stocks had been heading for a slight gain in the morning, until Mr. Trump said on his social media platform said he's considering <span class="link">"a massive increase of tariffs"</span> on Chinese imports. He's upset at restrictions China has placed on exports of its rare earths, which are materials that are critical for the manufacturing of everything from consumer electronics to jet engines.</p>
<p>"We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. I have always felt that they've been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!"</p><p>Mr. Trump also threatened to call off a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month. </p><p>"Threatening significantly increased tariffs on China is a hallmark of Trump's negotiating tactics, and all it took was a headline to entice investors to take some chips off the table," Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said in an email.</p><h2>Primed for a slide?</h2><p>The market may have been primed for a slide. U.S. stocks were already facing criticism that their prices had shot too high following a nearly relentless 35% run for the S&amp;P 500 from a low in April to record heights.</p>
<p>Critics say the market looks overpriced after prices rose much faster than corporate profits. Worries are particularly high about companies in the artificial-intelligence industry, where pessimists are making comparisons to to the 2000 dot-com bubble that ultimately imploded. For stocks to look less expensive, either their prices need to fall, or profits need to rise. </p><p>Other factors also weighed on investor sentiment Friday, including the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and fresh data showing that consumers are <span class="link">anxious about the economy</span>. </p><p>The University of Michigan's preliminary October sentiment index, released Friday, shows consumer sentiment fell 0.1% on a monthly basis, from 55.1 points in September to 55. While the drop was nominal, it represents the third consecutive month the confidence measure, which is closely watched by investors, has declined. </p><p>"Pocketbook issues like high prices and weakening job prospects remain at the forefront of consumers' minds," Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a statement.</p><p>The job market has slowed so much that the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate last month for the first time this year. Fed officials have penciled in more cuts through next year to give the economy more breathing room. But Chair Jerome Powell has also said they may have to change course if inflation stays high. That's because lower interest rates can push inflation even higher. </p>

<div class="article-title">Clinton and Rice commend Trump on MidEast peace deal, discuss path forward</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice on Friday praised the Trump administration's success in reaching a Middle East peace deal. Both of the former secretaries of state are still cautiously watching to see how the early phases play out but expressed some optimism about its prospects.</p><p>Clinton and Rice joined CBS News 24/7 for a live interview with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell to discuss the <span class="link">Israel-Hamas peace plan</span> brokered by President Trump as the first stage of the deal takes shape. </p><p>The conversation took place two days after the signing of a landmark deal in which Hamas agreed to release all remaining hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel pledged to withdraw its military from parts of the Gaza Strip. Mr. Trump has <span class="link">called the deal</span> the "first phase" of a comprehensive 20-point plan to end the two-year-long Israel-Hamas war. The president plans to travel to the Middle East as soon as this weekend, and said he hopes to be present for the return of the hostages. </p><p>"I really commend President Trump and his administration, as well as Arab leaders in the region for making the commitment to the 20-point plan and seeing a path forward for what's often called the day after," Clinton told O'Donnell. </p><p>O'Donnell asked Rice if she is confident this is the end of the war. </p>
<p>"No one can be completely confident, given the history of the Middle East," Rice replied, but she added that there are good reasons to be optimistic. </p><p>Rice and Clinton both said the Israelis and Palestinians must get through this first phase of the deal — and that still isn't certain. </p><p>"That's not self-evident," Clinton said. It's going to take a lot of work. It's going to take a lot of coordination."</p><p>One of the difficulties in achieving a lasting peace in the Middle East is getting various parties on board, but the fact that there's a broader coalition of Middle Eastern states involved in this agreement is a good sign, Rice said. </p>
<p>"The one piece that I'm most concerned about is, how do you get from a kind of transitional authority of some kind, a truly representative Palestinian authority?" Rice asked. "The Palestinian authority, which controls the West Bank, lost control of Gaza after 2006, has not really been reformed in a long time. And it needs reform. It needs younger blood."</p><p>Clinton called Israel's <span class="link">attack</span> on Hamas leaders in Qatar's capital of Doha in September "ill-advised" and a "strategic error" that gave Mr. Trump's negotiators an opening. </p><p>"That provided an opening for both President Trump and his representatives to marshal all of the regional powers, including, of course, Qatar, but also to make it clear to Israel, 'No, this is now enough. We cannot continue this. This conflict needs to end, and we've got to move on.'"</p><p>Clinton said of U.S. negotiators, "They took advantage of an opening that was available and were able to be successful."</p><p>Rice suggested a two-state solution isn't likely to be feasible right now, but she said there are things the Palestinians can do to prepare for a future state. Palestinians are going to need to insist on reforms themselves, she said. </p><p>"They've got to start to recognize that Israel is going to exist, and it's going to be a part of this Middle East," Rice said. "And that means, change the lessons that you teach your kids about the state of Israel. Stop putting up maps that (say) the state of Israel doesn't exist. Don't create another generation of Palestinians who believe that somehow the resistance is the way to peace and security."</p><p>Clinton said the Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank that has been encouraged by the Israeli government "has to cease."</p>
<p>She said the work of rebuilding Gaza will be arduous, laborious and intensive, and she called on the U.S. and international community to commit together to bring peace to the Middle East.</p><p>"Let's now support this process and bring it together, not just in a nonpartisan way in our own country, but literally internationally as a great global commitment to try to bring peace, security, stability and a better future to the Middle East," Clinton said. </p><p>The deal is expected to allow dozens of hostages to return to their families on Monday or Tuesday, ending a two-year <span class="link">ordeal</span> that began with Hamas' attack on southern Israel. It would also offer a reprieve to millions of residents of the Gaza Strip who have faced an intense and <span class="link">nearly</span> uninterrupted two-year bombardment and ground invasion by Israel's military. </p><p>Some questions remain, however. Mr. Trump's <span class="link">20-point peace plan</span> calls for Israel to withdraw from much of the Gaza Strip in phases, but the exact cadence of those withdrawals isn't clear. It also calls for control of Gaza to be handed over to a still-unformed "technocratic" committee that does not include Hamas and — at least for now — also leaves out the Palestinian Authority. The deal recognizes an independent Palestinian state as "the aspiration of the Palestinian people," but it's unclear if or when discussions on statehood could take place.</p><p>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has vexed every U.S. administration in recent history — including the two that Friday's guests worked in. Clinton <span class="link">pressed for</span> <span class="link">a two-state solution</span>  — but Obama <span class="link">struggled</span> with a chilly relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a period that also saw two smaller wars in Gaza. Rice also championed a two-state solution and made extensive efforts in the last years of the Bush administration to help negotiate peace. </p><p>But in part because then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and then-Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas were each short on the political support necessary to make a lasting deal, the conflict continued. One common critique of past administrations is that they have not made sufficient use of U.S. leverage over Israel, to pressure it to make concessions. Pressure on the Netanyahu government from President Trump appears to have been a critical factor in bringing about this peace deal now. </p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested there may be a link between autism and circumcision while <span class="link">reasserting the unproven theory</span> that Tylenol causes the disorder — and medical experts are pushing back against the claims.  </p><p>"There's two studies that show children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism. It's highly likely because they are given Tylenol," Kennedy stated during a Cabinet meeting on Thursday.</p><p>Circumcision is a surgical procedure that removes the foreskin from a boy's penis. For some, circumcision is a part of cultural or religious practices. A 2025 study from Johns Hopkins Medicine found the prevalence of the practice had decreased nearly 5%, going from 54.1% to 49.3% from 2012 to 2022.</p><p>Kennedy did not cite the studies he was referring to, but experts say potential matches — a 2013 study of eight countries and a 2015 study from Denmark, which both suggested a link between circumcision and autism rates — have issues. </p>
<p>The 2013 study looked at circumcision rates in boys versus autism rates. The authors admitted that national and state averages may show correlation, not causation, and said their study may have mistakes, bias and confounding. "Circumcision practices are also tied to culture and religion, which also affect autism diagnoses and healthcare use," said Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. </p>
<p>Confounding, which occurs when the relationship between an exposure and an outcome is distorted by the presence of a third variable, is "at the root of much of what RFK Jr. cites and claims," said Gounder.</p><p>For example, early studies linked coffee drinking with higher heart disease risk, but smoking (popular among the coffee drinkers in the studies) was the true driver, not coffee. People eat more ice cream and go swimming more in the summer. Swimming, not eating ice cream, might lead to drowning, but a poorly designed study might conclude ice cream was the culprit.</p><p>The 2015 study found that the risk of autism was higher among circumcised boys under age 5, but after age 5, the association disappeared. "If circumcision truly caused autism," said Gounder, "that association should continue even after age 5. They're likely picking up on the fact that kids undergoing circumcision in the healthcare system have greater contact with the healthcare system and have parents with higher levels of education and income — all of which are associated with being diagnosed with autism at a younger age than other kids. That association may disappear once kids start school, when teachers and counselors pick up on the symptoms."</p><p>Other experts also opposed Kennedy's claims.</p>
<p>"There is absolutely no studies establishing any causality," Dr. Steven Abelowitz, founder and medical director of Ocean Pediatrics, told CBS News. "While some observational studies suggest possibly an association, there's no studies (showing causality) — and the conclusion by any credible medical resource is agreeing that there's no causal relationship between Tylenol, circumcisions or vaccines to autism."</p><p>Acetaminophen — the active ingredient in Tylenol and many cold and flu medications — being at the base of the circumcision theory also doesn't add up in terms of timing, according to experts. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, children younger than 12 weeks should not be given acetaminophen unless instructed by their pediatrician, and most circumcisions happen before then with a local anesthetic.</p><p>While circumcision can happen at any age, most occur within the first week after birth and usually within the first 48 hours, according to the Cleveland Clinic. </p><p>"We almost never, ever use Tylenol after circumcision," Abelowitz said, adding he's performed about 10,000 circumcisions across his 30 years of practice.  </p><p>Kennedy's comments have even garnered international attention, with the United Kingdom's National Autistic Society sharing a statement. </p><p>"More dangerous anti-science from the US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy, now linking autism with circumcision. This is not based on any form of rigorous, robust research and could put lives at risk," Mel Merritt, the organization's head of policy and campaigns, said in a statement.</p><p>Last month, President Trump announced that the Food and Drug Administration believes the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with an increased risk of autism without sharing any new evidence. Medical experts, however, have said the medication is safe. </p>
<p>Following the administration's announcement, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists President Dr. Steven J. Fleischman said in a statement, "Suggestions that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism are not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients, including those who may need to rely on this beneficial medicine during pregnancy."</p><p>Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, previously told CBS News that "independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism."</p>

<div class="article-title">Flight delays persist at some airports as government shutdown continues</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Travelers planning to fly into or out of U.S. airports could feel the impact of staffing issues, which continue to build as the <span class="link">government shutdown</span> reached its 10th day Friday.</p><p>The "national picture today looks a little messy," CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave said from Los Angeles International Airport on Friday. </p><p>Across the U.S., roughly 52,000 flights are scheduled ahead of the Columbus Day weekend, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.</p><p>Tasked with keeping travelers safe on the ground and in the air, TSA officers and air traffic controllers are <span class="link">deemed essential</span> by the government, requiring them <span class="link">to keep working</span> during the shutdown without immediate pay. </p><p>However, an uptick in workers calling out sick has led to sporadic flight delays and cancellations, raising concerns over staffing shortages. The scheduling irregularities come as <span class="link">potential weather disruptions</span> are expected across the East Coast and in Phoenix.</p>
<p>"On top top that you have uncertainty that's been injected into basically everyone's travels because of the staffing situation that we're seeing pop up sporadically throughout the air traffic control system," Van Cleave said. </p><p>Typically, air traffic controller shortages drive about 5% of all flight delays. That figure is currently 53%, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox Business. </p><p>"It doesn't look like its a coordinated or targeted sick out per se, but you're seeing more sick calls than you would normally see, and so, everyday, particularly as we get into the afternoon and evening hours, multiple FAA facilities have what are called staffing triggers, where they are short-staffed basically," Van Cleave said. </p><p>"And some of those don't result in a whole lot of disruption, and we've seen others that have been pretty disruptive," he added. </p>
<p>For example, at Nashville International Airport in Tennessee on Thursday, roughly 40,000 flyers were inconvenienced by an air traffic controller shortage. "So it's not nothing, even if the vast majority off air traffic controllers are working," Van Cleave said. </p><p>Air traffic controllers who violate agency sick leave policies will face repercussions, Secretary Duffy said this week. </p><p>The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing such workers, said in a statement on its website that it does not condone their members taking actions that would compromise the safety of the nation's airspace. The union also urged workers to keep showing up on the job, despite not being paid on schedule. </p><p>"At this critical juncture, it is more important than ever that we rise to the occasion and continue delivering the consistent, high-level of public service we provide every day," tNATCA stated. </p><p>Still, the impact of staffing shortages on flights so far has been minimal, reported Van Cleave, but delays could worsen as staffing shortages continue.</p><p>"While delays and cancellations have been within historic norms this week, and the vast majority of fights are leaving on time, the amount of delays because of air traffic controllers staffing is up," he said. </p>

<div class="article-title">Here's how high silver's price has risen in 2025 (and why it's worth investing in now)</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>With all the talk about gold investing in recent years – which continued unabated this week after the <span class="link">price of the precious metal</span> surged past a record <span class="link">$4,000 per ounce</span> – investors would be forgiven for overlooking their <span class="link">silver investing</span> options.</p><p>But silver has many of the same benefits a gold investment offers for a fraction of the price. However, that seems to be changing, too.</p><p>While the advantages of precious metal investments are generally timeless, the costs associated with the specific metals are not. And while gold's price has remarkably surged in recent years, thanks to a combination of inflation, interest rate policy and geopolitical instability, silver hasn't exactly sat idle, either.</p><p>In fact, the price of the metal has risen exponentially, too. That allows investors who have been hesitant to pay gold's top price to get started with another, more affordable precious metal while still enjoying similarly large returns. To better understand the potential return on investment with silver now, however, it helps to know how high the price has risen so far this year. Below, we'll detail this rise and explain why it can be a worthwhile investment for many currently.</p><p>Explore your top gold and silver investing options here.</p><h2><strong>Here's how high silver's price has risen in 2025</strong></h2><p>On January 1, 2025, the price of silver per troy ounce was just $28.92, according to American Hartford Gold. By October 10, 2025, however, it had risen to $50.94 for the same amount. That's a difference of $22.02 in less than a year. Or, put another way, the price of silver is up 76% year to date.</p>
<p>If that rise wasn't significant enough, a further look back underlines how significant this increase really is. On October 10, 2022, silver was priced at just $19 per ounce. And, on October 8, 2018, it was just $14.46 per ounce. By comparison, today's silver prices are up 168% and 252%, respectively.</p><p>So the investment opportunities here are obvious, whether you take a short-term or long-term view of the metal's price surge. And with items like <span class="link">inflation</span> (which rose in the latest report), geopolitical instability and domestic concerns over the ongoing government shutdown prevalent now, the landscape is ripe for another silver price increase, perhaps even sooner than expected. It makes sense, then, to get invested before that happens.</p><p>Get started with a silver investment online now.</p><h2><strong>Why silver is worth investing in now</strong></h2><p>Similar to gold, the benefits of a silver investment are multiple and especially timely now. Specifically, silver can be worth investing in currently if you want to:</p><ul><li><strong>Hedge against inflation: </strong>Silver isn't impacted by market conditions in the same ways stocks and bonds are and, therefore, can generally be relied upon to maintain or <span class="link">rise in value during inflationary periods</span>.</li><li><strong>Diversify your portfolio: </strong>Because of this reliable price, silver is considered a smart <span class="link">diversification tool</span> for your portfolio, especially now with stock market performance elevated but with headwinds growing stronger.</li><li><strong>Turn a quick profit: </strong>Gold and silver are long-term investments considered to be more reliable as income protectors versus income-producing assets. Still, the remarkable price growth of both metals in recent years can't be understated and, in today's climate, an investment in the right amount and cost can quickly turn a profit in a way that was simply unattainable in other markets.</li></ul><p>Despite these timely benefits, avoid the temptation to overinvest, too. Most experts recommend limiting the precious metal portion of your portfolio to a <span class="link">maximum of 10%</span> to avoid overcrowding other assets at the same time.</p><h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>The price of silver is close to 80% higher this October compared to where it started the year and its significantly over 100% in just the past few years, underlining the benefit of investing in this unique asset right now. Take the time, then, to review your silver investing options and consider speaking with a representative from a <span class="link">top precious metal company</span>. They can answer your questions and help you determine the next steps in your wider precious metal investing strategy.</p>

<div class="article-title">AstraZeneca makes deal with White House to lower drug prices</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>AstraZeneca became the second drugmaker to enter a deal with the Trump administration to offer lower prices to Medicaid and to offer some of its drugs at a discount through TrumpRx, a government website to facilitate sales directly to consumers.</p> <p>"In other words the lowest price anywhere in the world, that's what we get," President Trump said during an Oval Office press conference Friday. The centerpiece of the deal is most-favored-nation pricing for drugs sold to Medicaid. That would link Medicaid prices to the lower ones paid in other developed countries.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, AstraZeneca will also offer discounts of up to 80% off list prices on direct sales to consumers, according to a company statement. Its drugs include inhalers like Bevespi Aerosphere for people with COPD and Airsupra for people with asthma. AstraZeneca, based in the U.K., also said it would expand drug manufacturing and research in the U.S.</p> <p>In return for these commitments, the drug company will get a three-year exemption from certain tariffs.</p> <p>The White House unveiled its plan for TrumpRx and a similar deal with Pfizer on Sept. 30. The website will help patients access drugs at lower prices — bypassing health insurance.</p> <p>TrumpRx is part of a broader initiative the administration says is aimed at bringing prices paid by Americans more in line with those paid in other developed countries.</p> <p>The announcement follows an executive order in May, and letters to 17 pharmaceutical companies sent out over the summer to push them to lower prices voluntarily.</p> <p>The TrumpRx website is expected to launch sometime in 2026, and would take consumers to pharmaceutical companies' direct-to-consumer websites to fulfill orders.</p> <p>The impact of the Trump administration deals with pharmaceutical companies for consumers is unclear. Medicaid and its beneficiaries, for instance, already pay some of the lowest prices for drugs. And people with health insurance could spend less on their medicines through copays than buying them directly from AstraZeneca.</p>
<p>AstraZeneca also said Thursday that it would invest an additional $500 million in a new manufacturing facility in Virginia, raising the investment to $4.5 billion. That's part of a $50 billion investment announced in July to expand manufacturing facilities in California, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Texas and Virginia, as well as other research and development efforts.</p> <p>"For all the pharmaceutical companies out there — we're talking to all of you, pick up a shovel," said Dr. Mehmet Oz, who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, during the press conference.</p> <p>Trump said his administration had gotten a total of $18 trillion total commitments to re-shore pharmaceutical manufacturing. NPR wasn't immediately able to independently confirm that number.</p>

<div class="article-title">Macron puts Lecornu back as France's prime minister just days after he quit</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday re-appointed Sebastien Lecornu as prime minister, just days after his resignation, asking him to try again to form a government and produce a budget in a bid to end the country's political deadlock.</p>
<p>Lecornu's re-appointment followed days of intense negotiations and came less than a week after he resigned amid infighting in his freshly named government. France is struggling with mounting economic challenges and ballooning debt, and the political crisis is aggravating its troubles and raising alarm across the European Union.</p> <p>The appointment is widely seen as Macron's last chance to reinvigorate his second term, which runs until 2027. Lacking a majority in the National Assembly to push through his agenda, Macron faces mounting criticism — including from within his own ranks — and has little room to maneuver.</p>
<p>Macron's office released a one-sentence statement late Friday night announcing the appointment, one month after the statement issued a month ago when Lecornu was initially named and four days after he resigned.</p>
<p>Lecornu said in a statement on social networks that he accepted the new job offer out of "duty." He said he was given a mission "to do everything to give France a budget by the end of the year and respond to the daily problems of our compatriots."</p>
<p>All those who join his new government will have to renounce ambitions to run for president in 2027, Lecornu said, adding that the new Cabinet will "incarnate renewal and a diversity of skills."</p> <p>"We must put an end to this political crisis that exasperates the French, and to this bad instability for France's image and its interests,'' he wrote.</p> <p>Lecornu abruptly resigned Monday, only hours after unveiling a new Cabinet that drew opposition from a key coalition partner. The shock resignation prompted calls for Macron to step down or dissolve parliament again, as he did in June 2024. But they remained unanswered, with the president instead announcing on Wednesday that he would name a successor to Lecornu within 48 hours.</p> <p>Political party leaders met for more than two hours Friday with Macron, at his request. Some cautioned that another prime minister picked from the ranks of Macron's fragile centrist camp would risk being disavowed by Parliament's powerful lower house, prolonging the crisis.</p>
<p>"How can one expect that all this will end well?" said Marine Tondelier, leader of The Ecologists party. "The impression we get is that the more alone he is, the more rigid he becomes."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Worried investors</h3> <p>Over the past year, Macron's successive minority governments have collapsed in quick succession, leaving the European Union's second-largest economy mired in political paralysis as France is faced with a debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France's public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion), or 114% of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>France's poverty rate also reached 15.4% in 2023, its highest level since records began in 1996, according to the latest data available from the national statistics institute.</p> <p>The economic and political struggles are worrying financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission, which has been pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt.</p> <h3 class="edTag">The newly reappointed PM faces challenges</h3> <p>The two biggest opposition parties in the National Assembly — the far-right National Rally and the far-left France Unbowed party — weren't invited to the discussions Friday. The National Rally wants Macron to hold fresh legislative elections and France Unbowed wants him to resign.</p> <p>Lecornu argued earlier this week that Macron's centrist bloc, its allies, and parts of the opposition could still clump together into a working government. "There's a majority that can govern," he said. "I feel that a path is still possible. It is difficult."</p> <p>Lecornu will now have to seek compromises to avoid an immediate vote of no confidence and may even be forced to abandon an extremely unpopular pension reform that was one of Macron's signature policies in his second presidential term. Rammed through parliament without a vote in 2023 despite mass protests, it gradually raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Opposition parties want it to be scrapped.</p> <p>The political deadlock stems from Macron's shock decision in June 2024 to dissolve the National Assembly. The snap elections produced a hung parliament, with no bloc able to command a majority in the 577-seat chamber. The gridlock has unnerved investors, infuriated voters, and stalled efforts to curb France's spiraling deficit and public debt.</p>
<p>Without stable support, Macron's governments have stumbled from one crisis to the next, collapsing as they sought backing for unpopular spending cuts. Lecornu's resignation, just 14 hours after announcing his Cabinet, underscored the fragility of the president's coalition amid deep political and personal rivalries.</p>

<div class="article-title">National Guard troops begin patrols in Memphis</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>National Guard troops have begun patrolling in Memphis, the Memphis Police Department confirmed with NPR. </p> <p>The Guard members are part of a federal task force, established by President Trump, to combat crime in Memphis. The task force includes agents from several federal agencies. It kicked off operations last week.</p> <p>The Trump administration has previously described Memphis as "suffering from tremendous levels of violent crime that have overwhelmed its local government's ability to respond effectively." </p>
<p>A small number of Guard members were already in Memphis for planning and logistics purposes, Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn "CJ" Davis said at a city council committee meeting on Tuesday. </p> <p>As of Friday, it remains unclear how many troops will be deployed and in what locations within Tennessee's second biggest city. </p> <p>In Memphis, the Guard is operating under the governor's command — which is different from how other cities are facing troop deployments. In California, Oregon and Illinois, Guard members were activated by the Trump administration — moves that are now being challenged in court by state and local officials.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>While some support the use of federal intervention to curb crime, critics accuse the administration of unfairly targeting Democratic-led cities. Legal experts also worry that Trump's pattern of imposing or threatening federal intervention in cities is testing the limits of presidential power and the use of military force.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>What will troops be doing in Memphis?</strong></h3> <p>Trump has described the anti-crime federal task force in Memphis as being a "replica" of his initiative in Washington, D.C. where troops have been deployed since August, mainly tasked with patrols and beautification efforts.</p> <p>A presidential memorandum about the task force said the priorities will be to reduce crime, enforce immigration laws, help the local police with recruitment, retention, and training, and coordinate "strict enforcement" against crimes ranging from battery to traffic violations. The memo also indicated that additional Guard personnel from other states can be mobilized if necessary.</p>
<p>The task force includes personnel from 13 U.S. agencies, including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p> <p>At a news conference last month, Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said troops will serve in support roles and they will not be responsible for making arrests. He added that Guard forces will remain unarmed unless specifically requested by local law enforcement. </p> <p>The governor also said the operation will occur in phases over the next few months. </p>
<p>A website launched by the city government said guard members will serve as extra "eyes and ears" to local and federal agencies on the ground.</p> <p>"Guardsmen and women will be easily identifiable in their standard uniforms that they wear every day. The guardsmen and women will not be wearing masks. Armored tanks will not be a resource used in this mission," the website added.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>How are local leaders feeling about the deployment?</strong></h3> <p>Lee has said he not only welcomed federal assistance, but that he has been in "constant communication" with the Trump administration for months about a plan to curb crime in Memphis using federal and state resources.</p> <p>"I'm tired of crime holding the great city of Memphis back," Lee said Sept. 15 during a visit to the White House. The state's Republican senators, Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, have also supported the move.</p> <p>Meanwhile, local leaders have expressed more caution. In his weekly newsletter on Sept. 19, Memphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, voiced skepticism whether the Guard is the "right tool for driving down crime." However, he said the city could use support in addressing homelessness and "community beautification" referring to efforts to reduce urban blight.</p>
<p>"We're already investing heavily in this work: grass cutting, litter pickup, and graffiti removal," he said. "And now, with additional hands and resources, we can scale that work — clearing more vacant lots, removing more trash, and restoring more blocks."</p> <p>When it comes to public safety, Young emphasized that Memphis has been moving in the right direction, citing that both homicides and overall crime have declined in recent years. But Memphis has historically grappled with high crime levels, including in 2023 when the city recorded over 340 homicides, according to the Memphis Police Department.</p> <p>The city is already involved in several joint state and federal task forces, including the FBI, U.S. Marshals, ICE and others.</p>

<div class="article-title">Peru: Chicha, the electric pulse of cumbia</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p><em>This is part of a special series, </em><em>Cumbia Across Latin America</em><em>, a visual report across six countries developed over several years, covering the people, places and cultures that keep this music genre alive.</em></p> <p>The people of Peru have many definitions for the word chicha: a sacred fermented corn drink, popular culture, popular art and, of course, Peruvian cumbia. It has also been used as a derogatory term, mocking immigrant culture in Lima during the mass migrations of Indigenous Andean people to Lima in the 20th century. When it comes to music, the term has become extremely controversial.</p>
<p>In a small <em>peña</em>, or neighborhood club, in Lima, two legends — Berardo Hernandez Jr., the son of Manzanita, and Pancho Acosta, of Compay Quinto — filled the venue with intricate and melodic electric guitar sounds, soloing at a rapid pace, using their fingers instead of picks. Fans smiled and danced, soaking in the magical sonic experience. Acosta, Manzanita and Enrique Delgado, of Los Destellos, all had a part in creating the chicha genre, which emphasized electric guitar and was uniquely Peruvian.</p>
<p>Berardo, known as Manzanita Jr., aligns with the theory that all Peruvian cumbia can be considered chicha. Pancho, on the other hand, insists that chicha is specifically Tropical Andina, a sub-genre that mixes Colombian cumbia with Andean folkloric music, known as huayno. Alfredo Villar, an author and art historian, says chicha "is the most complex moment of Peruvian identity, because it mixes everything — from its deepest roots to its most extreme and complex external influences. This is why it is so difficult to define … Chicha will always surprise you."</p>
<p>The inconceivable mix of Colombian cumbia, Cuban guaracha, Andean huayno and psychedelic rock, as well as countless other genres, including jazz and bossa nova, that melted together in Lima at the end of the 1960s created a truly delicious sound. Chicha peaked in the '80s as Lorenzo Palacios Quispe, known as Chacalón or El Faraón de la Cumbia, and Los Shapis, an Andean band from Huancayo, brought chicha to the masses.</p>
<p>Chacalón, who was the son of migrant parents and grew up in a barrio on the cerro of San Cosme, working odd jobs, became a megastar among marginalized migrants in the capital. Thousands would come down from the barrios on the mountains above Lima to see him sing from the heart about the struggles of daily life and the migrant experience, giving birth to the saying, "When Chacolón sings, the mountains come down." Los Shapis made history in 1983 when they filled a stadium in Lima, demonstrating the power of chicha and the new Andean residents of Lima. Chacalón died at the age of 44; 60,000 people attended his funeral. Los Shapis would go on to tour the world.</p>
<p>Last November, in Lima's cemetery of El Sauce, throngs of people crowded around graves bringing food and drink to the deceased during <em>Dia de Todos los Santos</em>, or All Saints' Day. As the light began to fade over the desert mountains surrounding the capital, four saxophonists played huayno music from Huancayo. The sound echoed off the walls of graves as families danced and drank beer. Chacolón could be heard from the speakers of a street vendor, and a family played Los Shapis on portable speakers while visiting their loved ones. Forty years later, chicha was still very alive in the Peruvian capital.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump administration says about 4,200 federal employees face layoffs</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>More than a week into the government shutdown, layoffs of federal workers have begun, following through on administration threats to slash the size of government during the shutdown.</p> <p>In a court filing late Friday, lawyers for the government wrote that an estimated 4,200 employees across at least seven agencies began receiving reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Oct. 10.</p> <p>The declaration, from Office of Management and Budget (OMB) senior advisor Stephen Billy, came in response to an order from the federal judge assigned to a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs.</p>
<p>Word that layoffs were underway first came from OMB Director Russell Vought in a social media post on X that said, "The RIFs have begun."</p> <p>While the administration initially offered few details on the scope of what it called "substantial" layoffs, some federal employees began sharing actual layoff notices on social media while federal employee unions said they'd been notified of pending cuts.</p> <p>Asked by reporters Friday how many workers may lose their jobs, President Trump did not give an exact figure, but told reporters "it'll be a lot."</p> <p>"We'll announce the numbers over the next couple of days, but it'll be a lot of people, all because of the Democrats," Trump said.</p>
<p>In his declaration, OMB senior advisor Billy stressed that while the information he was providing Friday was the most current, the situation "is fluid and rapidly evolving." The numbers are subject to change, he wrote, suggesting more RIFs could come in the future.</p> <p>Here are the agencies affected by the RIFs, according to the declaration, with the estimated numbers of employees who will be affected:</p> <h3 class="edTag">Department of Health and Human Services: 1100-1200 employees </h3> <p>Earlier Friday, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon confirmed that RIF notices are being sent out to agency employees.</p>
<p>"HHS employees across multiple divisions are receiving reduction-in-force notices as a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown," said Nixon shortly after Vought's post. "All HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated non-essential by their respective divisions."</p> <p>Nixon blamed the Biden administration for creating a "bloated bureaucracy," although HHS has already cut more workers — 20,000 workers through an earlier RIF and through voluntary resignations and retirements — than were added during the Biden administration.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Department of Education: 466 employees </h3> <p>A union representing Education Department employees said in a statement that "multiple union members" confirmed that at least two offices would be affected by RIFs: the Office of Communications and Outreach as well as the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education.</p> <p>"This administration continues to use every opportunity to illegally dismantle the Department of Education (ED) against congressional intent," AFGE Local 252 president Rachel Gittleman said in a statement on Friday. "They are using the same playbook to cut staff without regard for the impacts to students and families in communities across the country."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Department of Housing and Urban Development: 442 employees </h3> <p>Antonio Gaines, president of AFGE Council 222, representing employees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) across the country, confirmed to NPR that the union had received notice from HUD of its "intent to fire a number of employees."</p> <p>"We are in the process of reviewing the notice, assessing the impact and magnitude of the agency's decision, while acquiring legal guidance from the National office," Gaines wrote.</p> <p>A HUD spokesperson said the reduction in force was "to align our programs with the Administration's priorities and the appropriations available to the department."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Treasury Department: 1446 employees</h3> <p>On Reddit, IRS employees posted screenshots of actual RIF notices they had received, informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.</p> <p>"The Internal Revenue Service has determined it is necessary to abolish some positions in INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY to further workforce shaping efforts," read one such notice.</p>
<p>An employee with the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund shared a notice that the entire organization was set to be abolished.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Environmental Protection Agency: 20-30 employees </h3> <p>In court filings, the Trump administration said the EPA has not made a final decision on "whether or when to issue RIF notices."</p> <p>But earlier Friday, AFGE Council 238 president Justin Chen said he'd learned that Environmental Protection Agency employees overseeing recycling and composting initiatives, plastics reduction and other programs, were among those targeted for layoffs.</p> <p>"Weakening the EPA workforce is a direct threat to the health and safety of Americans," wrote Chen in a statement. "If Trump thinks he is only hurting federal workers with this decision, he is sorely mistaken."</p> <p>An EPA spokesperson blamed Democrats and the government shutdown for the layoffs.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Other agencies</h3> <p>The other agencies mentioned in the declaration are the Commerce Department, with 315 employees affected; the Energy Department, with 187 employees affected; and the Department of Homeland Security, with 176 employees affected.</p> <p>Here's what's ahead with mass layoffs at federal agencies : NPR</p> <p>Federal law is specific about the process that RIFs must follow, including a minimum 60 days' notice of their end date, or 30 days if a waiver is granted by the Office of Personnel Management.</p> <p>Some agencies may need to notify unions or Congress, and then draft official notices to send to affected employees. The notices are required to include information such as the reasons for the RIF and the effective date.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Unions seek legal recourse, again</h3> <p>The declaration came in a lawsuit filed by several unions over the threat of RIFs ahead of the shutdown, arguing "the Trump administration has made unlawful threats to dismantle essential federal services and functions provided by federal personnel, deviating from historic practice and violating applicable laws."</p> <p>U.S. District Judge Susan Illston had ordered the Trump administration to detail the status of "any currently planned or in-progress RIF notices to be issued during/because of the government shutdown." Illston will hold a hearing in the case next Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a statement Friday, American Federation of Government Employees National president Everett Kelley slammed the RIFs announcement.</p>
<p>"It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country," he said.</p> <p>Since the shutdown began, the Trump administration has made several threats to cut spending, fire workers and not pay some furloughed employees, arguing that the reductions are the fault of Democrats who won't drop their demands for extended health care subsidies in exchange for reopening the government.</p> <p>The White House has also said its decision to freeze transportation funding in Chicago and New York and cancel billions of dollars in Biden-era energy project grants are a continuation of their push to shrink the size and scope of the federal bureaucracy.</p> <p>Mass layoffs were a hallmark policy of the Department of Government Efficiency effort that began when Trump returned to office in January.</p> <p>In February, a memo from the Office of Personnel Management and OMB asked federal agencies to prepare multi-phase plans to implement Trump's "workforce optimization initiative" that includes layoffs and what the workforce would look like when the new fiscal year started Oct. 1.</p> <p>As NPR has previously reported, many agencies that implemented layoffs at the pressure and direction of DOGE have hired back workers in recent weeks, citing the inability to perform basic tasks and carry out Trump's policy priorities.</p> <p>While the Trump administration has argued that cuts to the federal government need to happen because of the lapse in funding, some experts say a shutdown does not mean layoffs are necessary.</p> <p>"There is no statute requiring them to lay off a substantial share of federal employees during a temporary government shutdown," Jessica Riedl with the center-right Manhattan Institute said. "That statute doesn't exist, and such practice has not occurred during previous shutdowns."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Layoffs dampen chance of funding compromise</h3> <p>Top Republicans on Capitol Hill are pinning blame for the mass layoffs on Democrats, who have refused to support a Republican-backed measure to reopen the government because it does not extend health insurance subsidies that are expiring later this year.</p> <p>GOP leaders also hoped the threat of mass layoffs would compel Democrats to relent. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the Trump administration was left with no choice.</p> <p>"I think they held off as long as they could," Thune told reporters Friday.</p> <p>But Democrats say Republicans are taking advantage of the shutdown to continue their ongoing effort to slash the footprint of the federal government.</p> <p>"Let's be blunt: nobody's forcing Trump and Vought to do this," Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a statement Friday. "They don't have to do it; they want to. They're callously choosing to hurt people—the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos."</p> <p>Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine., told reporters on Thursday that a bipartisan group was making progress on a possible path to end the shutdown that would include a vote on health insurance subsidies after the government reopens.</p> <p>But hope of a compromise may be fading again, as the layoffs inflame tensions in Congress even more.</p> <p>Collins was among the few Republicans to criticize the layoffs on Friday.</p> <p>"I strongly oppose OMB Director Russ Vought's attempt to permanently lay off federal workers who have been furloughed due to a completely unnecessary government shutdown caused by Senator Schumer," Collins wrote. "Regardless of whether federal employees have been working without pay or have been furloughed, their work is incredibly important to serving the public."</p> <p><em>NPR's Cory Turner, Jennifer Ludden and Michael Copley contributed to this report.</em> </p> <p><em>Have information you want to share about agency reduction-in-force plans and other changes to the federal government?

<div class="article-title">Perú: Chicha, el pulso eléctrico de la cumbia</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p><em>Esta cobertura es parte de una serie especial, </em><em>Cumbia across Latin America</em><em>, un reportaje visual en seis países documentado durante varios años, que abarca seis países y cubre a las personas, lugares y culturas que mantienen vivo este género musical.</em></p> <p>El pueblo peruano tiene muchas definiciones para la palabra chicha: una bebida sagrada de maíz fermentado, cultura popular, arte popular y, por supuesto, la cumbia peruana. También se ha usado como un término despectivo que se burla de la cultura inmigrante en Lima durante las migraciones masivas de pueblos indígenas andinos hacia la capital en el siglo XX. En cuanto a la música, el término se ha vuelto sumamente controvertido.</p>
<p>En una pequeña peña, o club barrial, en Lima, dos leyendas — Berardo Hernández Jr., hijo de Manzanita, y Pancho Acosta, de Compay Quinto — llenaron el lugar con sonidos intrincados y melódicos de guitarra eléctrica, haciendo solos a gran velocidad y usando los dedos en lugar de plectros. Los aficionados sonreían y bailaban, disfrutando de la mágica experiencia sonora. Acosta, Manzanita y Enrique Delgado, de Los Destellos, tuvieron un papel clave en la creación del género chicha, que enfatizaba la guitarra eléctrica y era exclusivamente peruano.</p>
<p>Berardo, conocido como Manzanita Jr., coincide con la teoría de que toda la cumbia peruana puede considerarse chicha. Pancho, en cambio, insiste en que la chicha es específicamente Tropical Andina, un subgénero que mezcla la cumbia colombiana con la música folclórica andina, conocida como huayno. Alfredo Villar, autor e historiador del arte, afirma que la chicha "es el momento más complejo de la identidad peruana, porque mezcla todo — desde sus raíces más profundas hasta sus influencias externas más extremas y complejas. Por eso es tan difícil de definir… La chicha siempre te sorprenderá."</p>
<p>La inconcebible mezcla de cumbia colombiana, guaracha cubana, huayno andino y rock psicodélico, así como numerosos otros géneros, incluyendo jazz y bossa nova, que se fusionaron en Lima a finales de la década de 1960, creó un sonido realmente delicioso. La chicha alcanzó su auge en los años 80 cuando Lorenzo Palacios Quispe, conocido como Chacalón o El Faraón de la Cumbia, y Los Shapis, una banda andina de Huancayo, llevaron la chicha a las masas.</p>
<p>Chacalón, hijo de padres migrantes y criado en un barrio del cerro de San Cosme, donde trabajó en varios oficios, se convirtió en una megaestrella entre los migrantes marginados de la capital. Miles bajaban desde los barrios en las montañas sobre Lima para verlo cantar con el corazón sobre las luchas de la vida cotidiana y la experiencia migrante, dando origen al dicho: "Cuando canta Chacalón, bajan los cerros." Los Shapis hicieron historia en 1983 al llenar un estadio en Lima, demostrando el poder de la chicha y de los nuevos residentes andinos en la ciudad. Chacalón murió a los 44 años; 60,000 personas asistieron a su funeral. Los Shapis continuaron su carrera de gira por el mundo.</p>
<p>El pasado noviembre, en el cementerio El Sauce de Lima, multitud de personas se congregaron alrededor de las tumbas llevando comida y bebida a los difuntos durante el Día de Todos los Santos. Cuando la luz comenzó a desvanecerse sobre las montañas desérticas que rodean la capital, cuatro saxofonistas tocaron música huayno de Huancayo. El sonido resonaba entre las paredes de las sepulturas mientras las familias bailaban y bebían cerveza. Se escuchaba a Chacalón desde los altavoces de un vendedor ambulante, y una familia ponía a Los Shapis en parlantes portátiles mientras visitaba a sus seres queridos. Cuarenta años después, la chicha seguía muy viva en la capital peruana.</p>

<div class="article-title">More than 20 kids in India have died from contaminated cough syrup. Who's to blame?</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>In India, this week, headlines capture the outrage.</p> <p>"Cough Syrup Horror" reads India Today. New Delhi Television Ltd or NDTV declares: "Toxic Cough Syrup Scare: What Went Wrong And Why All Syrups Aren't Unsafe"</p> <p>More than 20 children in India are dead. The cause: Cough syrup contaminated with industrial chemicals.</p> <p>For many, it feels like deja vu.</p> <p>"This is an issue which has been going on for 90 years or more," says Naseem Hudroge, an analyst at the World Health Organization's team on substandard and falsified medical products.</p> <p>In that time, more than 1,300 people — many children under 5 — have died of this type of contamination. And it's happened all over the world, including in the U.S. in 1937 when over 100 people died from an antibiotic that had been formulated as a liquid syrup and contaminated. Today, most cases happen in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>For a long time each incident was thought of as an isolated tragedy. "They were all treated as one-offs," says Hudroge.</p> <p>But that's changing.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Alarm bells</strong></h3> <p>For Hudroge, his fascination with this issue — and determination to do something — started at 10 o'clock one night in the summer of 2022.</p> <p>He was heading back to his hotel during a work trip when he saw a message about children dying in The Gambia in West Africa.</p> <p>"I had a feeling this was something quite serious, but the scale of the problem was not clear from that email — that came out over the next few days," Hudroge recalls.</p> <p>Children were arriving at the hospital with acute kidney injury. The most glaring symptom: "They have an inability to actually pee," he says. "This is quite a very, very serious condition." In The Gambia, at least 66 children died as a result, according to WHO.</p> <p>A few months later, Indonesia dealt with a similar situation. Then, before 2022 was over, it was happening in Uzbekistan too. The year's death toll due to contaminated cough syrup rose by an additional 268 people, according to WHO.</p> <p>"We then had three different manufacturers, so it wasn't the same product, and it wasn't the same country," says Hudroge. "This was too much of a coincidence."</p>
<p>And so WHO officials teamed up with experts from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime [UNODC] to undertake a multi-year investigation. It's the first time they've collaborated on this issue. The picture that's emerged is ominous.</p> <p>Their report, published in July, pointed to a clear culprit: criminal activity that crisscrosses the globe. "We have seen evidence of corruption, negligence, intentional or unintentional efforts to enter [toxins] into the [medical] supply chain. We also see a number of falsified documentation being used," says Murat Yildiz, research assistant at UNODC.</p> <p>"[These deaths are] not some sort of accident," says Dr. Saifuddin Ahmed, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "This is intentionally done to reduce the cost of the drug and to pocket more money."</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>What's in the syrup?</strong></h3> <p>The report lays out what's behind the decades of deaths: Shortcuts and cost-cutting measures in the production of inexpensive oral liquid medicines. Often these medications are marketed for kids and available without a prescription.</p> <p>What should happen in the manufacturing process is that an active ingredient — in these cases, a cough suppressant — is put into a pharmaceutical-grade liquid that is safe for consumption. Often the liquid solvent used is propylene glycol — a viscous, colorless liquid with a slightly sweet flavor. But in some facilities, a much cheaper liquid is used to dilute it or substitute for it.</p> <p>Sometimes the contaminant is an industrial-grade version of propylene glycol, says Ahmed, other times it's a toxic liquid, called either diethylene glycol or ethylene glycol. These liquids look just like the safe-to-consume propylene glycol but they are poisonous industrial chemicals used to manufacture engine coolant, brake fluids and anti-freeze.</p> <p>"Your kidneys are trying to remove these toxins from your body. We have to remember that these are very young children and their kidneys are simply overwhelmed by the toxins," Hudroge explains.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>"They get a slap on the wrist"</strong></h3> <p>What Yildiz and his team at WHO and UNODC pieced together by studying eight distinct incidences is just how systematically and internationally this dangerous substitution has occurred.</p> <p>Their report listed a litany of problems.</p> <p>One issue, says Yildiz, is that there's no easy and cheap way for a manufacturer to dispose of the big plastic or steel drums the safe liquid is sold in. So those drums can fall into the hands of criminals who then refill them with the cheaper, toxic liquids and pass them off as the pharmaceutical-grade product, selling them to drug manufacturers who are looking to save money on ingredients.</p> <p>"We have seen that there is an online market for second-hand drums," Yildiz says. "And some of the drums have the authentic labels on still which basically enhances the confidence of the buyer [the pharmaceutical manufactures]."</p> <p>Another big challenge: The manufacturing of medical products is global. For example, the inactive ingredient might be made in South Korea. The active ingredient in China. The manufacturing plant in India. The products might end up all over East Africa.</p> <p>"There are — for lack of a better word — bad guys who exploit this global nature," says Hudroge. "They exploit regulatory gaps, because at some point between Country A and Country B there is a gap and that's where they can insert drums of these substances and then present them [to cough syrup makers] as perfectly safe."</p> <p>Dinesh Thakur says these international borders not only help criminals get their materials into the supply chain, it also helps them avoid legal repercussions. "There is no international framework that enables the grieving parties in The Gambia to hold the manufacturer in India accountable," says Thakur, a chemical engineer and author of <em>The Truth Pill: The Myth of Drug Regulation in India. </em></p>
<p>The number of people to blame can be long — from those who fill the drums with toxic liquids to manufacturers that fail to do the proper testing to customs officials who are being paid off. But when prosecutions are brought, often within an individual country, the laws are often quite lenient on this type of crime and "the punishments are really, really, really low," says Hudroge. "So the bad guys are aware that they can get away with it because the investigative powers are not there or, if they're caught, they get a slap on the wrist and there's no financial deterrent."</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>"The whole world is at risk"</strong></h3> <p>Ahmed says the world should take note of what's unfolding in India because the country is one of the world's largest manufacturers of medications. For example, the contaminated cough syrups in The Gambia, Indonesia and Uzbekistan were manufactured in India.</p> <p>"Whenever this happens in India, it is not the issue of only India. The whole world is at risk. This is the most alarming part," he says. "India completely failed in this particular respect because it is repeatedly happening."</p> <p>He worries that with the online sale of medications and the increasingly global nature of drug manufacturing, this problem of contaminated medications will only get worse.</p> <p>WHO told NPR that it has contacted Indian authorities telling them it "stood ready to support national authorities in investigating and responding to these tragic events." WHO added that it was told by India that one of the cough syrups tested contained 48.6% of the toxic substance and that none of the contaminated products in this instance were exported from India.</p> <p>There are systems in place to help address the issue of contaminated medications. In 2021 India set up the Online National Drug Licensing System — and, after the 2022 tragedy, required an extra level of screening for exported cough syrups. The WHO also a simple methodology for testing ingredients and its own certification system for pharmaceutical products. But according to a report out this year in PLOS Global Public Health, India has not "fully implemented" the WHO certification system. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, Indian police did arrested the owner of the cough syrup maker, Sresan Pharmaceutical Manufacturer. NPR reached out to the company for comment but has not yet heard back.</p> <p>Ahmed says more is needed to bolster India's regulatory standards. He says that's what happened in the U.S. after the 1937 tragedy. The outcry accelerated the enactment in 1938 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which underpins the Food and Drug Administration's current regulation of medicines.</p> <p>NPR reached out to both the Drugs Controller General of India and the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission within the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Neither replied to emails requesting interviews.</p> <p>In an article published earlier this year, Indian authorities wrote that they'd taken steps to improve the safety of pharmaceuticals manufactured in India, including inspections of manufacturing facilities and "rigorous quality control checks of medicinal products intended for export." However, earlier this week, the country's Drug Controller General acknowledged in a memo that Sresan Pharmaceutical Manufacturer had not been properly testing its products for safety.</p> <p>This doesn't surprise Thakur, who doubts that this admission — or even the owner's arrest — will lead to long-term reforms. His worry is that as soon as the children's deaths fade from the headlines "then people don't really pay attention to it until the next one happens."</p> <p><em>Freelance journalist Kamala Thiagarajan contributed reporting to this story.</em></p>

<p><em>Good morning. You're reading the Up First newsletter. </em>Subscribe<em> here to get it delivered to your inbox, and </em>listen<em> to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.</em></p> <h3 class="edTag">Today's top stories</h3> <p><strong>Today marks the beginning of the first phase of President Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza. </strong>This follows the Israeli government's approval of a ceasefire deal with Hamas, allowing for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza and around 2,000 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.</p>
<ul class="edTag"><li>🎧 <strong>The Israeli military announced they </strong><strong>would pull back</strong><strong> from deep inside Gaza to an agreed upon line</strong>, starting the ceasefire, NPR's Aya Batrawy tells <em>Up First</em>. Immediately after, crowds of people in Gaza headed back to their homes. But many of them will find their residences are now gone. There is some skepticism over the deal because the two previous U.S.-backed deals have fallen apart. But Trump says this deal is about more than Gaza — it is about Mideast peace.</li><li>🎧 <strong>Officials said last night that the U.S. is sending around 200 troops to the area as part of an international stabilization force.</strong> Their role is to oversee the area to ensure there are no violations of the signed agreement, says NPR's Deepa Shivaram. Trump also stated he is trying to leave on Sunday to visit the region, most likely to Egypt, but it is unclear where he plans to go. When the hostages are released, the president says he hopes he will be in Israel, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu invited him to address the country's parliament.</li></ul>
<p><strong>The Justice Department yesterday indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James on bank fraud and making a false statement to a financial institution.</strong> The charges come after persistent pressure from Trump to prosecute one of his longtime political foes. The indictment claims that James lied on her mortgage application for a $109,600 loan to purchase a property in Norfolk, Va., in 2020. It alleges she promised her financial lenders it would be a secondary residence for her personal use, but instead she rented it out. <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>🎧 <strong>The indictment was handled by a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia</strong>, the same place where former FBI Director James Comey was indicted a few weeks ago. The White House had pushed out the top prosecutor at that court after lengthy investigations showed that the evidence in both cases was too weak to charge Comey or James, says NPR's Ryan Lucas. After Trump publicly called for the Justice Department to prosecute them, they were indicted, triggering alarm bells that the president was using the DOJ to target his perceived political enemies. James says she is being targeted for doing her job as N.Y. state attorney general.</li></ul> <p><strong>Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.</strong> The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised her for her relentless efforts to promote democratic rights for the people of Venezuela.</p>

<p>Health officials are expected to release new dietary guidelines this fall, and based on Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s public comments, a radical change could be made to what Americans have seen in years past. The Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture update the guidance every five years to reflect the latest research findings. The advice in the 2025 scientific reports hasn't changed much from previous years, and includes an emphasis on consuming fruits and vegetables, lean meats and whole grains. However, Kennedy has promised big changes. This is what could be in store: <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>🍽️ The guidelines have traditionally recommended limiting saturated fats, which are typically found in red meat. However, Kennedy enjoys meat and saturated fats.

Some researchers argue that data doesn't support the existing recommendation to favor low-fat dairy.</li><li>🍽️ The Trump administration has committed to developing a "government-wide definition" for ultraprocessed food. Some experts are concerned about the impact of a new definition, and say it should avoid sweeping up foods that are beneficial to one's health, like certain yogurts or whole-grain breads.</li></ul> <h3 class="edTag">Weekend picks</h3>

<div class="article-title">Israel says it has completed a pullback of troops in Gaza</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Israeli forces completed a pullback of troops from Gaza on Friday after Israel's Cabinet approved a plan for a ceasefire aimed at ending the devastating 2-year-old war.</p> <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a brief statement early Friday that the Cabinet had approved the "outline" of a deal to release the hostages — a key part of the initial agreement.</p> <p>"The government has now approved the framework for the release of all the hostages — both the living and the deceased," the statement read. It did not detail other more contentious parts of the pact hammered out Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hamas is believed to hold 20 living hostages and the bodies of another 26, while the fate of two more is unknown. The handover of the living hostages is expected to begin Monday.</p>
<p>The Israeli Justice Ministry said 250 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held in Israeli prisons, as well as about 1,700 people detained in Gaza since the war began, are set to be released as part of the deal. Israel plans to deport freed prisoners to Gaza or other unspecified locations, and will not be allowed to return to Israel or the occupied West Bank.</p> <p>Israeli forces began pulling back from the coastal highway into Gaza city overnight after the Cabinet approval of the ceasefire, which requires troops to retreat to a buffer zone.</p> <p>The official Israeli gazette of Cabinet decisions said the ceasefire began upon Cabinet approval of the agreement overnight Friday.</p> <p>Palestinian residents have been massing near Gaza City hoping to return to their damaged and destroyed homes.</p> <p>"I feel reborn," said Mohammad Rajab, 33, who said the Israeli army was so far preventing people from returning. "Despite all the sadness and the huge destruction, we are looking ahead and thinking about how we will build our lives, our future, our children's future, and rebuild everything that was destroyed and move away from war."</p>
<p>"Israel has no goals to achieve nor do the Palestinians have anything more to lose," he said.</p>
<p>In the southern Gaza Strip, tank shelling was heard and smoke seen rising in Khan Younis on Friday morning, according to residents. It was not clear whether any attacks fell within the bounds of the ceasefire agreement on the Israeli pullback.</p> <p>The war, sparked two years ago by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, has killed at least 67,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children, in Israeli attacks.</p> <p>About 1,200 Israelis and foreigners were killed in the Oct. 7 attack.</p>
<p>A U.N. independent commission determined last month that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza. Israel rejects that characterization.</p> <p>The war also sparked dramatic power shifts in the region, including weakening Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and helping to result in the overthrow of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>It also deepened Israel's international isolation and made Israel and President Trump's goal of more Arab countries normalizing relations with the Jewish state less attainable.</p> <p>The ceasefire announced Wednesday still leaves questions over who will govern Gaza, reconstruction of the devastated Palestinian territory and whether Hamas would keep its weapons.</p>
<p>Two senior U.S. officials who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity said the U.S. would contribute about 200 troops as part of a multinational effort to support and monitor the ceasefire deal. They said the U.S. Central Command would establish a civil-military coordination center that would also be involved in movement of humanitarian aid.</p> <p>The U.S. would coordinate with Israel forces, and no American troops would be sent into Gaza.</p> <p>Other countries contributing troops are expected to include Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>President Trump is expected to travel to the region this weekend. The Israeli Knesset has formally invited him to address the assembly — the first such address by a U.S. president since 2008.</p>
<p>A key part of the ceasefire deal would allow food and medicine to flow into Gaza. International experts this year declared famine in the Palestinian enclave as a result of Israeli restrictions on aid.</p> <p>Other countries expressed their support for the ceasefire and willingness to help.</p> <p>The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said an EU humanitarian team is ready at Egypt's now-closed Rafah border crossing with Gaza to facilitate aid movement. He said the EU assistance mission to the Palestinian Authority police in the West Bank could also support a "stabilization force" in Gaza.</p> <p><em>Anas Baba contributed reporting from Gaza.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">In the age of algorithms, one Irish town still does love the old-fashioned way</div>

<p>LISDOONVARNA, Ireland — Years ago, while traveling with my family along Ireland's west coast, I spotted a curious billboard. It was blue and hot pink, and showed a man with shoulder-length hair and a gray beard smiling out from the roadside.</p> <p>It was for a matchmaking festival — Europe's largest, our tour guide assured us. The man in the photo was Willie Daly, the town's resident matchmaker.</p> <p>"Maybe any singles here can head to Lisdoonvarna next September to find your one true Irish love!" he declared as we drove past, earning the dull laugh for a line he had clearly delivered countless times before.</p>
<p>That was 15 years ago. Since then, dating has moved to apps and algorithms, to swipes and screens. But this September, I turned off the road and into the town itself to see what endures — and what has faded.</p>
<p>Lisdoonvarna, a village of fewer than 1,000 people, sits not far from the Cliffs of Moher, where the land falls into the Atlantic as if the world itself ends there. A single street, a scatter of pubs — and, for one month each year, a transformation as it becomes home to Europe's last great matchmaking festival.</p> <p>The tradition stretches back more than 150 years, when farmers came after the harvest to find wives. Today, thousands still descend. Some are chasing romance, others just the music and the jive. But beneath it all is something rare: an almost old-fashioned earnestness. People still come here to look one another in the eye.</p> <p>At a crowded hotel bar, three women from County Kerry sit watching couples dance the Irish jive, an upbeat couples dance that resembles the Lindy Hop. Geraldine Beirne, Marie Walsh and Nora O'Sullivan say they've been coming since their 20s. Now in their 60s, they still return each year. No, not for men, they insist, but for the laughter, the music — and the company. That's not to say they haven't seen romance here before.</p>
<p>"My sister met her husband here. My best friend met her husband here. I did meet somebody that was in my life for a while here," says Walsh.</p>
<p>Back then, they even remember busloads of Americans rolling into town. That doesn't happen anymore. "Since COVID, Lisdoonvarna's had a big drop," Beirne says. "The atmosphere, the whole scene changed. It has got quieter. But like that, when you're good friends, you come out and you have a ball anyway."</p> <p>The three sound wistful. Yet across town, outside another bar, a younger crowd has gathered.</p> <p>"I'm looking to find true love," says 30-year-old Fearghal O'Sullivan, cradling a pint of beer in hand. He means it.</p>
<p>"You have no real connection with Tinder, you know?" adds his friend Liam Shivers. "I want to look a woman in her eyes when I first meet her. I really believe in love at first sight."</p> <p>Shivers pauses, laughs at himself. "I thought I had it once, but she said no. She said, 'Stop looking at me.'"</p> <p>Later, more friends will join them for Lisdoonvarna's big Saturday blowout.</p> <p>By evening, the Matchmaker Bar is almost at capacity. There's live music, dancing, and in the corner, the star attraction — Willie Daly, the matchmaker himself.</p> <p>He arrives to find a crowd already waiting for him. An old friend wants only to shake his hand. Three young women sit anxiously, one having dragged friends from Spain and Dublin in hopes of finding boyfriends. "I'm sick of them complaining," she says.</p> <p>Daly thinks he's in his early 80s, though he isn't sure (the town doctor wasn't much with records).</p>
<p>He sets up his booth in an alcove at the front of the bar. Once it had a door, but he took it off. "It was too private," he says. "Took too long to listen to everyone's story."</p> <p>Now, he tapes up signs that say things like "Love Won't Wait" and spreads out his questionnaires. "What are your interests?" "What are your personal preferences for a partner?" Later, he'll go through people's responses and start making matches.</p>
<p>But first, he pulls out his most prized possession: a hundred-year-old ledger, passed down through three generations, bound in tape and rubber bands like some tattered spellbook.</p> <p>"You don't count the seconds," he says, explaining the book's magic. "You just touch the book. You think about happiness and love. Close your eyes and think about being happy and in love, and you'll be in love and married inside the six Irish months." Which, he admits, could mean anything from six days to six years.</p> <p>Over the decades, Daly says he's matched some 3,000 couples. "That never seemed many," he shrugs.</p> <p>His system of fees is equally vague. Sometimes 3 euros, sometimes 40, most often 5 ($5.86). "Five euros for a husband!" he shouts, laughing.</p> <p>One by one, people sit with him. He listens, nods, then scribbles a word or two across their form: "Gorgeous." "Intelligent." Once, "Pamela Anderson."</p> <p>It is matchmaking, yes — but also ritual, theater, even confession. For many, just being heard is enough.</p>
<p>Not everyone who sits with him is single. Laura Ryan, 37, has been with a partner for 15 years but never married. "I really only want a blessing," she tells him. His advice? "Tell him you got a lot of offers."</p> <p>Daly admits his own marriage did not last. "I better touch wood," he says. "You should never count what you have. They say you should never count your sheep, count your cows, count your pigs, count your money or count your wives." Still, he beams when talking about his 20 grandchildren. His father introduced him to his wife, he says proudly.</p> <p>Now, his granddaughter, 25-year-old Oonagh Tighe, is ready to carry the work on.</p> <p>"First thing we say is, 'Are you single?' 'Would you like a woman,' 'Would you like a man?' " she says. Tighe has already arranged her share of matches, including Patrick Mead and Angela Heavey, who met here two years ago. "She asked for our star signs," Mead recalls. "She looked it up and said, you're compatible. You're a match." They're still together, celebrating their anniversary at the festival.</p>
<p>Others travel much farther. Denise Almas, from Vancouver, Wash., flew in after stumbling across the festival online. "I got off dating apps three years ago. Never again," she says. "This is more normal. You're live, in person. And we need more of this. We need more community in the U.S."</p> <p>Almas is not alone in that frustration. A 2025 Forbes Health poll found that 78% of dating app users in the U.S. reported frustration with them, citing ghosting, superficiality and a lack of real connection.</p>
<p>"Community is our culture," says Melissa Condon, a farmer from Tipperary attending the festival with her husband. "It's about meeting people, talking, telling stories."</p> <p>By midnight, the party has shifted to the Ritz Hotel.</p> <p>Two dance floors are going at once. There's a DJ on one side, a live band playing traditional Irish music on the other. Young and old, swirling together in the blur of it all. Not everyone — not even most — have found love. But the joy is in the gathering, and the earnest belief that they just might.</p> <p>And then, just before the lights come up, Geraldine Beirne, one of the Kerry women who thought the festival's best days were long gone, finds me in the crowd.</p> <p>Seventeen years a widow, she is beaming. She says she just met a man.</p> <p>"A gentleman," she says, smiling. "With amazing blue eyes."</p> <p>Maybe, after all, it's only the beginning.</p>
