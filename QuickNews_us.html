<div class="article-title">Dodgers' Freddie Freeman hits walk-off home run for World Series Game 3 win in 18-inning classic</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A sleeping giant finally woke up late Monday night on the West Coast and early Tuesday morning on the East Coast.</p><p>Freddie Freeman came to plate in the bottom of the 18th inning and hit a solo home run to give the Los Angeles Dodgers a World Series Game 3 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays, 6-5. He became the first player in MLB Postseason history to hit multiple walk-off home runs in the World Series. He did it in Game 1 last year against the New York Yankees.</p><p>The marathon could have been ended at any point between the 10th and 18th innings. The Dodgers had a great chance in the bottom of the 13th. Freeman came up to bat with the bases loaded and hit the ball as far as he could hit it before it was tracked down by a Blue Jays outfielder.</p><p>Toronto made a couple of risky decisions on the basepaths that led to outs. It was worth it at the time to try to end the game, but defensive plays from Tommy Edman and Teoscar Hernandez were able to shut down any hopes of a Blue Jays victory.</p><p>The game may not have even sniffed extra innings without the game from Shohei Ohtani.</p><p>Ohtani hit two home runs in a 4-for-4 night for the Dodgers. He reached base safely nine times, setting a World Series record. Ohtani is set to pitch in Game 4 on Tuesday night – less than 24 hours from when Freeman hit the home run.</p><p>"I want to go to sleep as soon as possible so I can get ready," Ohtani told FOX’s Tom Verducci through an interpreter.</p><p>Dodgers reliever Will Klein also played a massive role in Los Angeles’ win. Klein pitched four innings of scoreless baseball and struck out five. He threw 72 pitches – the second most of the night behind starter Tyler Glasnow.</p><p>Hernandez started Los Angeles off with a solo home run off Blue Jays starter Max Scherzer in the second inning. Ohtani followed that up with his first home run of the night in the third inning. But those were the only two blemishes for Scherzer.</p><p>The veteran star pitcher locked in the record of the way home. He was hit for three earned runs on five hits in 4.1 innings.</p><p>Toronto struck back in the top of the fourth.</p><p>Blue Jays catcher Alejandro Kirk hit a three-run home run off Tyler Glasnow to give Toronto the lead. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette scored on the dinger. Later, Andres Gimenez scored Addison Barger on a sacrifice fly.</p><p>An Ohtani RBI double and a Freddie Freeman RBI single tied the game in the bottom of the fifth. But Bichette singled home Guerrero to take back the lead.</p><p>Of course, Ohtani had a chance to make even more of an impact. With no one on in the bottom of the seventh, Ohtani hit a monster home run off Seranthony Dominguez to tie the game once again.</p><p>It was an 18-inning marathon from there, tying the mark for the longest game in World Series history.</p><p>Game 4 is set for later Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET on FOX.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Book bummer: Why reading is in deep decline</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Let me start off with a confession.</p><p>I’ve always been an avid reader. There was a time when I was constantly plowing through novels – Updike, Irving, Roth, Malamud, Atwood – plus occasional non-fiction, including all of Bob Woodward’s books.</p><p>And as the author of six books, I love the feel of a bound volume. It’s always a rush to get that first copy in your hands, a great feeling of accomplishment.</p><p>But all that was before smartphones – or more precisely, the kind of phones and apps that bombard us with Instagram and TikTok hot takes, endless images and AI summaries.</p><p>And now I’m not reading anywhere near as much. Too busy glued to the screen.</p><p>My attention span has shrunk. Harder to sit through, say, a two-hour movie. Easier to watch in shorter segments.</p><p>Has my brain been transformed? Have I just gotten lazy? (That’s a rhetorical question.)</p><p>I began dwelling on this after reading a Free Press essay by James Marriott titled "The Dawn of the Postliterate Society."</p><p>Delving into history, he writes that in the middle of the 18th century, "huge numbers of ordinary people began to read."</p><p>What was once an elite pursuit filtered down to the middle and lower classes, thanks to expanding education and an explosion of cheap books. It was, says Marriott, "the greatest transfer of knowledge into the hands of ordinary men and women in history." This exposed the masses to radical new ideas, and included such essayists as Samuel Johnson and Edward Gibbon.</p><p>Media analyst Neil Postman is quoted as having said in 1985: "To engage the written word means to follow a line of thought, which requires considerable powers of classifying, inference-making, and reasoning."</p><p>And now, Marriott flatly declares, "books are dying."</p><p>You sensed this was coming, didn’t you?</p><p>In America, "daily reading for pleasure has fallen by more than 40 percent in the last 20 years." Ouch.</p><p>The publishing business is badly ailing: "Books that once would have sold in the tens, even hundreds, of thousands are now lucky to sell in the mid-four figures."</p><p>College students "have grown up almost entirely in the world of short-form video, computer games, and addictive algorithms (and, increasingly, artificial intelligence)."</p><p>That’s their world.  They don’t remember what it was like before. They were too young at the time.</p><p>Coincidentally, I found a box of long, handwritten letters that I exchanged with close friends when I was 15, 16, 17 – even a five-pager from the girlfriend of a friend who had moved to L.A. There was no texting then and long-distance calls were expensive. Unlike today, when it’s "Whaddup" and "OMG" and "ASAP" and "BRB."</p><p>A study of English Lit students at two Midwestern universities last year found that most couldn’t understand the first paragraph of Charles Dickens’s "Bleak House."</p><p>So who can we blame for this sad state of affairs?</p><p>First, it doesn’t apply to everyone. We have free will. We can set aside time for reading. And "Bleak House" is no easy breeze.</p><p>A study cited by the Times of London says students will spend 25 years of their lives glued to smartphones – Gen Z most of all. A quarter-century. Wowza.</p><p>Glenn Stephenson, co-founder of Fluid Focus, is quoted as saying we must "confront an uncomfortable truth: we unknowingly handed powerful, addictive technologies to children during their most formative years — without fully understanding the risks in doing so."</p><p>So that’s it. It’s our fault.</p><p>Maybe adjustments will be made. Maybe the savvier students will see the need for a course correction. Maybe we’ll have so much wearable technology that it won’t seem as distracting.</p><p>Or maybe, alas, publishing will largely go the way of the horse-and-buggy business, aimed at the elite equivalent of those who own horses.</p><p>I’ve started a couple of books, then put them aside for later reading, then picked them up a month or two later for a few pages. Now, where did I leave them…?</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Hannity announces he will host town hall with GOP New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Fox News host Sean Hannity announced he will host a town hall with Republican New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli that will air on Fox News Thursday.</p><p>New Jersey’s governor's race is one of the most closely watched elections, as Ciattarelli once again looks to turn the blue Garden State red after coming close to beating Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021. </p><p>The polls in recent weeks against his opponent, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill, have tightened. </p><p>A Fox News poll conducted Oct. 10–14 put Sherrill at 50% support among likely voters, with Ciattarelli at 45%. Sherrill's 5-point advantage was down from an 8-point lead in Fox News' September survey in New Jersey.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News Digital on Oct. 15, Ciattarelli noted that he "made big gains" in his 2021 showing "in Hudson County and Passaic County," two long-time Democratic Party strongholds. He also pointed out that President Donald Trump has a following in those counties.</p><p>"And the president did very, very well in '24 in those very same counties. And if you take a look at who's been endorsing me, including some very prominent Democrats here in Hudson County, people want change," Ciattarelli argued.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sherrill has cited Ciattarelli’s approval of President Trump’s policies against him. </p><p>On Oct. 8, she charged that her Republican rival had "shown zero signs of standing up to this president." </p><p>"In fact, the president himself called Jack 100% MAGA, and he's shown every sign of being that," Sherrill asserted.</p><p>The race has been rocked by explosive accusations on both sides. </p><p>According to Sherrill's military records, the United States Naval Academy blocked her from taking part in her 1994 graduation amid a cheating scandal, which Ciattarelli called disqualifying. </p><p>The veteran later took aim at her Republican opponent by accusing him of being "complicit" in tens of thousands of New Jerseyans’ opioid deaths, based on his owning a medical publishing company that pushed content promoting the use of opioids as a low-risk treatment for chronic pain.</p><p>Visit Hannity.com for ticket information for Thursday's town hall in Point Pleasant, N.J., ahead of the state’s election on Nov. 4.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Travis Kelce ties Chiefs' touchdown mark as Kansas City puts on show in win</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Travis Kelce tied a franchise mark for total touchdowns as the Kansas City Chiefs used a second-half surge to trounce the injury-riddled Washington Commanders on Monday night, 28-7.</p><p>Kelce notched the 83rd touchdown of his career on a 10-yard pass from Patrick Mahomes in the third quarter. He had 80 touchdown catches, two rushing touchdowns and one fumble recovery returned for a touchdown. He tied Priest Holmes with the milestone.</p><p>The touchdown also added Kelce to an exclusive club with other legendary tight ends. He joined Antonio Gates, Tony Gonzalez, Rob Gronkowski and Jimmy Graham as the only other tight ends in NFL history with at least 80 touchdown catches. Counting the playoffs, Kelce has 100 touchdown catches in his career.</p><p>Kansas City went up 21-7 after the score and really never looked back from there.</p><p>Kelce had six catches for 99 yards as Kansas City has yet to have a 100-yard receiver this season. Mahomes was 25-of-34 with 299 passing yards, three touchdown passes and two interceptions.</p><p>Kareem Hunt had two touchdowns in the game as well – one rushing and one receiving. Rashee Rice had the other receiving touchdown.</p><p>The Commanders were playing without Jayden Daniels and George Fant as well as key defensive figures in Noah Igbinoghene and Ale Kaho.</p><p>Marcus Mariota started for Daniels again and had the Commanders in pretty good position to get an advantage. Mariota found Terry McLaurin for an 11-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter. McLaurin used a nifty toe tap to secure the touchdown.</p><p>Coming out of halftime, the Commanders’ offense was nowhere to be found. Washington only had one offensive possession in the third quarter and were susceptible to punts in the fourth.</p><p>It was far from the type of play that was needed to beat the defending AFC champion Chiefs.</p><p>Mariota was 21-of-30 with 213 yards, a touchdown pass and two picks.</p><p>Don’t look now, but the Chiefs have won five of their last six games and have the Buffalo Bills in their crosshairs in Week 9.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">The Decision: Jeffries toes the line, takes the plunge in long-awaited NYC mayoral endorsement</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Even up until the last hour, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., played it coy about endorsing Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayor’s race.</p><p>"Early voting, as you know, starts tomorrow," observed a reporter to Jeffries at 11:06 a.m. on Friday. "Are you ready to endorse Mamdani?"</p><p>"Stay tuned," replied Jeffries.</p><p>"What more do you need to hear at this point?" asked another scribe.</p><p>"Same answer," said Jeffries. "I have not refused to endorse. I have refused to articulate my position and I will momentarily, at some point in advance of early voting."</p><p>Well, early voting began Saturday in New York. And true to his word, Jeffries articulated his position via a statement early Friday afternoon, throwing his political clout behind Mamdani.</p><p>"Zohran Mamdani has relentlessly focused on addressing the affordability crisis and explicitly committed to being a Mayor for all New Yorkers, including those who do not support his candidacy," said Jeffries. "The communities I represent in Brooklyn are being devastated by this extreme version of the Republican Party. In this environment, we have a clear obligation to push back against the national nightmare being visited on the American people by Republican extremism."</p><p>Jeffries closed his endorsement with this key line: "I endorse the Democratic ticket."</p><p>In some respects, that was the least newsworthy line in Jeffries statement. It might be preposterous to think that the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, from New York City, would not endorse the Democratic candidate for mayor of his hometown.</p><p>It would have been a bigger story had Jeffries not endorsed Mamdani.</p><p>We don’t definitively know what Jeffries may have mulled for so long. But we do understand the fissure inside the Democratic Party between centrist Democrats and the far left. This is why Republicans shout from the Empire State Building that Mamdani is a "socialist" or even a "communist." Republicans not-so-secretly love the fact Mamdani is the Democratic nominee. And they embrace the fact that Mamdani makes some Democrats squirm as the party tries to reach moderate voters – and simultaneously grapples with the leftist views of the nominee.</p><p>"What we're witnessing is truly the end of the Democratic Party as we've known it," opined House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. "Hakeem Jeffries finally relented. He gave in and he gave his endorsement to the socialist running to be mayor of New York City. The House Democrats, they've shown the world what they really believe. There is no longer a place for [centrists] and moderates in their party."</p><p>Republicans also claim that the reason Democrats "shut down the government" is because Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., heard footsteps from the left and feared a primary challenge. In Schumer’s case: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.</p><p>"They decided to save their own skin that they had to endorse the Marxist Mamdani," speculated Johnson. "In an unprecedented move, they have also decided they had to shut down the government in an unprecedented move."</p><p>When pressed on MSNBC over the weekend why it took him so long to endorse Mamdani, Jeffries replied that he wasn’t "someone that I knew prior to him receiving the Democratic nomination."</p><p>Jeffries added that he wanted "to sit down and have some conversations" with Mamdani.</p><p>But the endorsement question has been a tortured avenue for Jeffries ever since Mamdani captured the Democratic nomination for mayor on June 25.</p><p>On the day Mamdani won the primary, Jeffries offered his "congratulations to Zohran Mamdani on a decisive primary victory."</p><p>But Jeffries did not endorse.</p><p>"We spoke this morning and plan to meet in central Brooklyn shortly," said Jeffries.</p><p>Four days later, ABC’s Jonathan Karl asked Jeffries if he had endorsed Mamdani yet.</p><p>The answer was no.</p><p>"He out-worked, he out-communicated, and he out-organized the opposition. And that’s clearly why he was successful," said Jeffries.</p><p>"So, what’s holding you back from endorsing him right now?" asked Karl.</p><p>"Well, we don’t really know each other well. Our districts don’t overlap. I have never had a substantive conversation with him," answered Jeffries.</p><p>And that’s how it went, all summer long – and into the fall. Reporters frequently peppered Jeffries with questions about a potential endorsement or what the holdup was. And Jeffries was always circumspect.</p><p>In fact, resistance to endorse fueled speculation that Jeffries harbored reservations about Mamdani. That’s nothing to say of possible headaches Mamdani could create for the party as it tries to court swing voters.</p><p>"What does he need to do to secure your endorsement?" asked CNN’s Dana Bash on August 24.</p><p>"(Rep.) Yvette Clarke, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, and myself are scheduled to sit down with him in the next few days. I look forward to that conversation," said Jeffries.</p><p>"What do you want to hear from him? What's missing? I mean, it's pretty unusual for a high-ranking Democrat like yourself to withhold the endorsement of your party's nominee for candidate for New York City mayor," countered Bash.</p><p>"I don't think we have withheld an endorsement. We are engaging in a conversation about the future of New York City," said Jeffries.</p><p>Bash questioned if Jeffries wasn’t endorsing Mamdani because "he hasn't denounced using the term or supporting the term ‘globalize the intifada?’"</p><p>"I have raised several of the issues with him privately, as well as publicly spoken about some of the concerns that I have had," said Jeffries.</p><p>So, there were in fact "concerns."</p><p>"What do you say to your young constituents, energized young constituents that help put Mamdani in the position that he's in and now they're calling for you to represent their wishes and endorse him?" asked a reporter of Jeffries at the Capitol on October 6.</p><p>"I think I've answered those questions repeatedly, and I'll have more to say before early voting," said Jeffries.</p><p>There were more questions for Jeffries about Mamdani on October 9.</p><p>"We’re in the middle of a government shutdown," sidestepped Jeffries when asked about possible plans to endorse. "I would have more to say about the mayor’s race in advance of early voting in NYC which begins at the end of this month."</p><p>So Jeffries has now endorsed Mamdani. And that should answer all questions, right?</p><p>Doubtful.</p><p>Republicans pounced on Jeffries’ decision to endorse. Moderate Democrats and many pro-Israel voters moaned. Yes. Jeffries may have needed to achieve a comfort level with Mamdani and clear up questions the Minority Leader had in his own mind. But in the end, Jeffries may not have had any choice but to endorse. A failure to endorse could have splintered the party. Jeffries likely had to evaluate which was the greater danger: not endorsing and outraging the left or endorsing and losing those in the middle.</p><p>Everything in politics is a calculus. Jeffries made his calculus – on behalf of himself, New York City and his party.</p><p>Yes, Republicans will excoriate Jeffries for this decision. But they would try to connect Jeffries to Mamdani anyway. Fair or not.</p><p>It’s doubtful that Jeffries endorsement would win or lose the mayoral race for Mamdani anyway.</p><p>But a refusal to endorse would highlight the fracture inside the Democratic Party. And that could have fueled more questions than Jeffries ever fielded about whether he would endorse or not.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Man who went viral for heckling Winsome Sears with racist comment dealt another blow after getting fired</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The man who went viral for lobbing racially charged insults at Virginia gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears during a college football game earlier this month, subsequently filed a police report claiming he was getting harassed after the incident went viral. </p><p>The Fairfax County Police Department confirmed to Fox News Digital that it was aware of the police report that was filed and that, ultimately, the department's threat assessment unit found that the information provided did not meet the criteria for a criminal investigation.</p><p>"Go back to Haiti!," the man from the viral video yelled at Sears, a Republican, during a James Madison University football game earlier this month. "Traitor!" </p><p>After the incident, Sears clarified on social media that she is an immigrant from Jamaica, not Haiti.</p><p>"I thought Democrats were supposed to love everyone," Sears quipped at the time.</p><p>The man, identified by local news reports as Scott Pogorelc, from Centerville, Virginia, was also reportedly fired by his employer, a subsidiary of government contractor Lockheed Martin. A JMU football player by the same last name is a redshirt senior on the Dukes' offensive line. </p><p>"We hold all of our employees and subsidiaries to the highest standards of integrity and professional conduct. Any behavior that violates our Code of Ethics will be thoroughly investigated and employees found in violation will be held accountable. Zeta Associates investigated the matter, and the individual is no longer employed," said a statement from a Lockheed Martin spokesperson, according to Fox 5 DC reporter Allison Papson. </p><p>Meanwhile, Pogorelc is also a Democratic Party donor, according to Federal Election Commission filings and the Virginia Public Access Project. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic candidate for Virginia governor running against Sears, was among those he has donated to.</p><p>The situation involving Pogorelc was not the first time Sears has faced racially insensitive remarks in recent months amid her campaign. In August, while speaking out against transgender bathroom policies outside an Arlington County school board meeting, a counter-protester held up a sign that read: "Hey Winsome, if trans can’t share your bathroom, then Blacks can’t share my water fountain."  </p><p>Following that incident, current GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is facing the end of his term limit, blasted what he described as the "hypocrisy of the liberal left."</p><p>"Winsome is so much bigger than this idiocy," Youngkin wrote on X. </p><p>"This is wrong. [Winsome Earle-Sears] — and Virginia — deserve better," added Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares in response to the sign. Miyares is running for reelection against Democratic Party candidate Jay Jones.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Aging Putin brings younger generation, family members into circle amid Kremlin instability: report</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin is tightening his grip on power by elevating younger loyalists amid growing instability inside the Kremlin as he ages, according to reports.</p><p>On Sunday, The Telegraph reported that Putin, 73, who has ruled Russia for more than two decades, is "running out of cards to play" as pressure mounts both domestically and abroad. </p><p>The Federal Security Service (FSB) also opened a criminal case against exiled businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky and 22 members of the Anti-War Committee of Russia, accusing them of plotting a seizure of power, per reports. Khodorkovsky spent a decade in a Siberian prison before founding the Anti-War Committee in 2022.</p><p>John Herbst, Senior Director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told the U.K. outlet that "the Kremlin is falling into paranoia."</p><p>"All the people around him have started thinking about a world beyond Putin, so he has arranged his own elite in a really careful way, so there are no clear seams along which it would kind of rip apart," Henry Hale, Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at George Washington University, told Fox News Digital. </p><p>"He also has members of his own family now that are starting to rise in the ranks. One of the ones that has gotten the most attention is Anna Evgenievna Tsivilyova, née Putina," Hale said. </p><p>Tsivilyova, 52, is Putin’s first cousin once removed and currently heads the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation, a state-run organization that supports Russian soldiers and veterans. </p><p>She has also served as chair of the board of the Kolmar Group, one of Russia’s largest coal companies.</p><p>"The younger people are being brought up by the older generation integrated seamlessly into the power pyramid," Hale said.</p><p>"Putin is worried about what happens as he ages and if you don't provide some opportunity for younger people to rise up, you know, then the regime might come under some pressure."</p><p>"These people can be trusted because they're related to people close to Putin, and they can also be young and energetic. The younger people are being brought up by the older generation, integrated seamlessly into the power pyramid," Hale added.</p><p>In 2023, Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin staged a brief mutiny, sending his fighters toward Moscow before abruptly standing down only to die weeks later in a plane crash. </p><p>Now, the Kremlin’s focus has shifted to silencing opposition abroad. </p><p>"Tensions remain within the elite and Putin wants to get rid of any possible risks," Hale said. "The 2023 incident was a warning from Putin to his own elite, his own inner circle, not to dare try anything. Putin and his people are watching each other carefully and so don't try anything funny," Hale added.</p><p>Recently, western sanctions, less oil revenue, and war costs could push Russia toward recession.  </p><p>The Treasury Department under President Donald Trump sanctioned Russia’s two largest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil, escalating pressure on the Kremlin to end its war in Ukraine. </p><p>According to reports, the Russian government could raise taxes and increase domestic borrowing to close the gap.</p><p>"Putin has weathered the main crisis that the full-scale invasion of Ukraine brought Russia, which was the initial shock of the invasion and its failure to take Ukraine in a matter of days," Hale added. </p><p>"But war brings uncertainty and there's a risk of disastrous defeat, underperforming expectations. All the people around him start thinking about a world beyond Putin."</p><p>"That said, well, I think Putin's regime is fairly stable at the moment," Hale concluded.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to the Kremlin for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Allie Hoffman's "The Feels" mixer aims to foster deeper connections in modern dating in an unorthodox process that costs up to $200 per person.</p><p>At an event attended by USA Today on Oct. 22, Hoffman spoke about the state of modern dating and how she hopes her program, which she founded in 2022, can help people connect more easily with others.</p><p>"It feels so hard out there, and we're really believing that it's our fault," Hoffman said. "I don't believe that's true. I think there's some macro-level forces that are affecting us, that are creating what we're in right now. And I'm here to unwind a lot of that."</p><p>The process, which comes in different levels, involves participants being paired off throughout the room. The pair is then given a discussion prompt with topics ranging from "What do you do?" to "How do you show and receive affection?" to foster communication. Each conversation would end with some form of physical interaction such as a "finger trace," an embrace or prolonged eye-contact.</p><p>The Level 1 event costs approximately $90 to $100 per person, while the Level 2 event, which includes a survey and more personalized matching, can cost up to approximately $200 per person.</p><p>Hoffman argued at a Level 2 event in Los Angeles that capitalism, technology and pop culture have diminished interpersonal skills needed for dating and reduced relationships to transactional exchanges based on unrealistic expectations. She said that authentic connection is key to fixing the issue.</p><p>"It's an act of real rebellion to choose to be really present with another being," Hoffman said. "I'm really interested in how we can map paths back to that."</p><p>Though her event is a response to the issues of modern dating, Hoffman said that she does not believe The Feels is intended to help people find "the one." Instead, she hopes that people can use The Feels to practice emotional vulnerability with others.</p><p>"For me, the dream is for people to take it off the mat and into the world. That they ask deeper, open questions. That they stop and be like, 'I just want to positively reflect you.' They stop and say, 'Hey, can we just hold a hug a little bit longer?'" Hoffman said. "It's not about meeting the love of your life. It's about learning new tools."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to The Feels for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A mass shakeup of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) leadership is underway amid growing friction inside the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over deportation tactics and priorities, according to four senior DHS officials.</p><p>The overhaul affects ICE field offices in at least eight cities and will replace many senior leaders with Border Patrol officials, marking an unprecedented power shift inside DHS and exposing sharp divisions over how far to go in ramping up deportations, the officials told Fox News.</p><p>The changes are being driven by competing camps inside DHS.</p><p>On one side are Border Czar Tom Homan and ICE Director Todd Lyons, who have advocated focusing on criminal aliens and those with final deportation orders.</p><p>On the other side are DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, senior adviser Corey Lewandowski and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino, who have pushed for a broader and more aggressive approach, targeting anyone in the U.S. illegally to boost deportation numbers.</p><p>Two senior officials described the mood inside DHS as "tense" and "combative," with some ICE leaders warning the new approach could erode public support and blur the line between ICE and Border Patrol operations.</p><p>"ICE started off with the worst of the worst, knowing every target they are hitting, but since Border Patrol came to LA in June, we’ve lost our focus, going too hard, too fast, with limited prioritization," one senior DHS official told Fox. "It’s getting numbers, but at what cost?"</p><p>Another senior official put it bluntly, "ICE is arresting criminal aliens. They [Border Patrol] are hitting Home Depots and car washes."</p><p>Border Patrol agents have defended the new strategy.</p><p>"What did everyone think mass deportations meant? Only the worst?" one agent told Fox News. "Tom Homan has said it himself — anyone in the U.S. illegally is on the table."</p><p>The internal friction comes as deportation totals remain below targets set by the administration earlier this year. Officials told Fox News that the latest round of reassignments impacts ICE field chiefs in Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Denver, Portland, Philadelphia, El Paso and New Orleans — positions expected to be filled by Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials.</p><p>A separate DHS official confirmed the personnel changes, describing them as "performance-based" and designed "to move people around for the best results."</p><p>DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: "While we have no personnel changes to announce at this time, the Trump administration remains laser focused on delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country."</p></body></div></body></html>

It would be unlikely that they would want him back in the bullpen regardless of his comments on Monday.</p><p>The two-time World Series champion told the "Swing Completo" podcast in Spanish that he would "retire on the spot" if he was traded back to the Yankees.</p><p>"No way.

Never again."</p><p>Chapman explained he felt "a lot of disrespect" while playing in the Bronx. He said he got along with the players and manager Aaron Boone but had an issue with how the "bosses" conducted business.</p><p>"I got along well with all the players, never had a problem with anybody, even the manager.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Trump administration signaled to a federal judge on Monday during a hearing that it would rather deport Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Africa than follow through with prosecuting him on charges of transporting illegal migrants.</p><p>Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland grilled a Department of Justice lawyer over the plans, asking if the administration would remove Abrego Garcia to Liberia this week if it could overcome legal hurdles. Xinis currently has an injunction in place blocking Abrego Garcia from being deported.</p><p>"I have been told that if there was no prohibition, we would remove him on Friday," DOJ lawyer Drew Ensign said.</p><p>Xinis pressed Ensign about Abrego Garcia's criminal case in Tennessee, and Ensign replied that he did not know how deporting Abrego Garcia would affect that case. The judge voiced skepticism about the timing of the administration's desired deportation date of Friday.</p><p>Xinis noted that a high-pressure hearing is happening next week over whether the DOJ vindictively brought criminal charges against Abrego Garcia after initially admitting to erroneously deporting him to a prison in El Salvador earlier this year. </p><p>"I don’t believe a criminal case can go forward if there’s no defendant," Xinis said, adding, "I'm trying to figure out how useful this Friday is, and the reason why I'm asking is because it's common knowledge there is an evidentiary hearing [in Tennessee] next week."</p><p>Liberia is now the fourth African country raised by lawyers for the Trump administration after they previously identified three others, Uganda, Ghana and Eswatini, that could potentially accept Abrego Garcia, pending dissolution of Xinis' injunction keeping him in the United States.</p><p>The judge signaled that the Department of Homeland Security's position of wanting to deport him and the DOJ's position of wanting to take him to trial did not add up and that she suspected some behind-the-scenes logistical discussions were taking place.</p><p>"It just doesn't pass the sniff test that there hasn't been some coordination," Xinis said.</p><p>Abrego Garcia's defense attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg told the judge his team was unsatisfied with Liberia, saying they were unclear on whether their client would be detained or free in Liberia and that they currently suspect he could be re-deported to El Salvador, where he has established a credible fear of persecution.</p><p>Sandoval-Moshenberg reiterated that Abrego Garcia is open to being deported to Costa Rica, the only country that has explicitly agreed to grant him asylum and to not send him back to El Salvador.</p><p>Xinis questioned Ensign about the administration's position on deporting him to Costa Rica, after Abrego Garcia's attorneys previously accused the government of dangling that option in exchange for him pleading guilty in his criminal case in Tennessee.</p><p>"Any insight you can shed on why we’re continuing this hearing when you could deport him to a third country tomorrow?" Xinis asked, adding, "Now we're about to burn significant resources … to now talk about a fourth African country."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the DOJ for comment.</p><p>In August, when Abrego Garcia's attorneys first told the court about the DOJ floating Costa Rica as part of a plea deal, a DOJ spokesperson said in a statement that pleading guilty or standing trial were Abrego Garcia's only options because he presented a "clear danger" to the community. Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p><p>"This defendant can plead guilty and accept responsibility or stand trial before a jury," the spokesperson said. "Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people."</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Breanne Deppisch and Fox News' Jake Gibson contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New York City socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani offered up a clarification on Monday about an anecdote that sparked controversy on social media related to an anecdote he told about his "aunt" not using the subway in New York City due to post-9/11 Islamophobia. </p><p>"I was speaking about Zehra fuhi, my father’s cousin, who passed away a few years ago," Mamdani told reporters on Monday, using the term "fuhi" which the New York Post reported means paternal aunt in Hindi and Urdu, after social media users had raised questions about the veracity of his story.</p><p>"I want to speak to the memory of my aunt who stopped taking the subway after September 11th because she did not feel safe in her hijab," Mamdani, fighting back tears, told a crowd on Oct. 24 while outlining his concerns about Islamophobia and suggesting that criticisms of his anti-Israel positions are rooted in a disdain toward his Muslim faith.</p><p>Shortly after that clip hit the internet, a wave of criticism hit from conservatives and internet sleuths who poked holes in the story and suggested Mamdani had embellished it, pointing to his one direct biological aunt, Dr. Masuma Mamdani, listing on her LinkedIn that she worked and presumably lived in Tanzania from January 2000 to December 2003. Additionally, publicly available photos of Masuma Mamdani don’t show her wearing a hijab.</p><p>The controversy reached the White House in the form of a post on X from Vice President JD Vance who expressed skepticism about the story.</p><p>"According to Zohran the real victim of 9/11 was his auntie who got some (allegedly) bad looks," the vice president wrote. </p><p>Mamdani's father Mahmood, who Zohran Mamdani says is the cousin of the deceased aunt, has faced criticism during the campaign for his past controversial statements as a professor at Columbia University, including a claim that Hitler was inspired by Abraham Lincoln, which resurfaced on social media in recent days. </p><p>Mahmood Mamdani also sits on the advisory council of an anti-Israel organization that supports boycotts and sanctions of Israel, and routinely accuses the Israeli government of committing "genocide", Fox News Digital reported this summer.</p><p>"Suicide bombing needs to be understood as a feature of modern political violence rather than stigmatized as a mark of barbarism," the elder Mamdani wrote in his 2004 book Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror. </p><p>"We need to recognize the suicide bomber, first and foremost, as a category of soldier."</p><p>Zohran Mamdani has pushed back in recent days against critics of his various anti-Israel policies and statements dating back to his time in college and suggested that those criticisms are rooted in anti-Muslim bigotry. </p><p>"The dream of every Muslim is simply to be treated the same as any other New Yorker," Mamdani posted on X on Friday with a video that was viewed at least 24 million times. "And yet, for too long, we have been told to ask for less than that, and endure hatred and bigotry in the shadows. No more."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A 31-year-old registered sex offender with a history of violent crimes has been arrested in connection with an attempted rape on the campus of Johns Hopkins University, according to reports.</p><p>Police say Raymond Willis Lunn was taken into custody by Baltimore County officers earlier this week. Lunn faces charges of attempted rape and assault. </p><p>According to FOX 45, investigators said the assault occurred on the evening of Oct. 18, when Lunn allegedly approached a 19-year-old woman walking through an area of campus known as "the quads." She told police the suspect first asked for directions before attacking her from behind, forcing her to the ground near a bench and removing some of her clothing. She said he fled when other people began to approach.</p><p>Detectives obtained surveillance video showing the suspect before and after the incident, prompting authorities to release still images to the public.</p><p>Multiple tips came in shortly after, according to the outlet, including one caller who identified the man as Raymond Chambers, Lunn’s former legal name. Another reported seeing someone matching the suspect’s description at a local treatment center, where officers later located and interviewed Lunn. The victim then identified him from a photo lineup.</p><p>During a bond hearing, Judge Mark Scurti called Lunn an extreme danger to the community and the victim, citing his criminal history, FOX 45 reported. </p><p>Lunn, however, maintained his innocence, claiming police "picked up the wrong person" and that his clothing merely resembled what was seen in surveillance photos. Charging documents indicate he was unable to explain his whereabouts after 7 p.m. on the night of the assault.</p><p>Court records obtained by FOX 45 show Lunn’s record of sexual and violent offenses stretches back nearly a decade. He was convicted of a sex crime in Baltimore County in 2016, leading to his registration as a sex offender.</p><p>In 2018, he was convicted of second-degree attempted rape for attacking a FedEx worker. Judge Kathleen Cox, who is now retired, sentenced him to 20 years in prison, suspending all but eight years of the term.</p><p>Records show Lunn was paroled in May 2024 but returned to custody in 2025 for a probation violation. In September 2025, Judge Wendy Epstein sentenced him to time served and continued his probation. Less than six weeks later, Lunn was arrested in the Johns Hopkins case.</p><p>During the hearing, Lunn’s attorney said his client has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and requested that he be placed on electronic monitoring, referencing an earlier order by a Baltimore County judge, FOX 45 reported.</p><p>Following the arrest, Johns Hopkins University Police Chief Branville Bard confirmed that investigators tracked the suspect’s movements throughout the day of the incident. The arrest was announced jointly by campus police and the Baltimore City Police Department.</p><p>University President Ronald Daniels issued a statement expressing shock and concern over the attack, emphasizing the school’s commitment to student safety and gratitude for the swift police response.</p><p>"This has been a deeply distressing situation for many members of the Hopkins community," Daniels said. "The safety and well-being of all members of our community will always be our highest priority, and we are fully committed to ensuring that you can feel safe and supported where you live, learn, and work."</p><p>Students on campus expressed frustration over ongoing safety concerns. Aneesh Swaminathan, a student interviewed by WMAR-2 News, said, "No student should be getting constant messages about assaults or robberies. It’s happening far too often. We need more visible police presence, especially at night, to feel safe."</p><p>University officials said additional patrols and safety measures are being reviewed in response to recent incidents.</p><p>Police are reviewing other recent sexual assault reports in the area to determine whether Lunn may be linked to any additional cases.</p><p>Investigators are asking anyone with information or who may have been a victim to contact the sex crimes unit at 410-396-2076.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the university and police for comment. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A transgender high school student in Indiana accused of plotting a Valentine’s Day mass shooting has reached a plea deal, pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit murder.</p><p>Trinity J. Shockley, 18, was charged in February in Morgan Superior Court with conspiracy to commit murder and two counts of intimidation to commit terrorism.</p><p>Shockley identifies as a transgender male and often goes by Jamie or Dex, according to authorities.</p><p>Court records show a plea agreement was filed Friday, with a hearing held Monday where Shockley pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder, a Level 2 felony. The two intimidation charges were dropped under the deal. Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 24 at 10:15 a.m.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to the Morgan County Prosecutor’s Office for comment on the matter.</p><p>Under Indiana law, a person convicted of a Level 2 felony faces between 10 and 30 years in prison. The Indianapolis Star reported that Shockley’s attorney requested a sentence of no more than 12.5 years in prison and up to five years of probation.</p><p>As part of probation, Shockley must meet with mental health professionals, is prohibited from searching for school-shooting content and is barred from entering Morgan County school properties.</p><p>Authorities said Shockley’s alleged plan to attack Mooresville High School was uncovered when the FBI in Indianapolis received a tip and contacted the Mooresville Metropolitan Police Department. The FBI later said it "swiftly coordinated" with local officials to investigate.</p><p>The tip indicated that Shockley planned a shooting, had access to an AR-15 rifle and had ordered a bulletproof vest. It also said Shockley was infatuated with Nikolas Cruz, who carried out the 2018 Parkland school shooting on Valentine’s Day.</p><p>A search of Shockley’s home by the Morgan County Sheriff’s Department revealed a "shrine" to recent mass shooters, including Cruz, Dylann Roof, who killed nine people in a Charleston church, and Ethan Crumbley, who carried out the 2021 Oxford High School shooting in Michigan. Court documents said Shockley also kept a photo album and buttons featuring the shooters’ faces.</p><p>Investigators found notebooks in which Shockley identified as "Dex… a transgender male [who has] a lot of homicidal thoughts."</p><p>"These thoughts never seem to stop, you may believe that I am some edgelord, but in reality, I am just a loser," Shockley wrote in a Dec. 16, 2024 entry, according to court documents. "I am grateful for my chance to live but in reality, I am scared of living. Is it the government you ask? No. It is this sad reality of living with piece(s) of s---… I hope whoever reads this takes acknowledgment and maybe use it for your massacre. :)"</p><p>In January, Shockley wrote about wanting to harm others and said people needed to be "killed" and "wiped away from humanity."</p><p>Authorities also uncovered Discord and Snapchat messages where Shockley, using the handle "Crazy Nikolaz," described plans for "Parkland part two" and said, "I’ll be honest. I’m close to shooting mine up. I have an AR-15."</p><p>Investigators said Shockley planned to carry out the attack at lunchtime "because that would present the most target-rich environment."</p><p>According to court documents, Shockley later told police the plan was a joke.</p><p>"[Shockley] stated that [Shockley] wanted to recreate [what] Cruz did, but [Shockley] would never do anything like that," the documents said. "It was said out of rage. [Shockley] is trying to get help with it. [Shockley] wanted to be in home school because of how bad the thoughts got…"</p><p>Shockley also told police about being bullied after being hit by a suspected drunk driver in September 2022. The crash left Shockley with a fractured skull and brain injuries, according to a WRTV report.</p><p>Detectives wrote that Shockley had sought mental health support from the school district, but the request was denied by Shockley’s father, who "did not believe in mental health treatment," according to a school official.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Sarah Rumpf-Whitten contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

So, during that process, I had this idea for this song that sort of dealt with facing age and facing all that stuff that comes along with it," before singing the song he mentioned, called "King Rodeo."</p><p>Lyrics of the song include: "Hey, King Rodeo, You're lookin' lonely, Like you've lost you're one and only, Adoring crowds are not around you, Whispers and shadows, they surround you."</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to a rep for McGraw for comment.</p><p>McGraw is set to hit the stage on Nov. 1 in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and perform three nights in Las Vegas at Caesars Palace in December.</p><p>In January 2025, McGraw stepped down from a Netflix rodeo series he was set to star and produce in, according to Deadline.</p><p>The "1883" actor reportedly needed back surgery and needed to recover, the outlet's source reported at the time.</p><p>He was supposed to play a bull rider, a physically demanding role.</p><p>McGraw is no stranger to overcoming obstacles.</p><p>The "Live Like You Were Dying" singer has been sober since 2008, after battling alcohol addiction.</p><p>He credited Hill, whom he has been married to since 1996, for helping him overcome his addiction.</p><p>In 2021, McGraw told Esquire that he realized he needed help when he drank alcohol first thing in the morning.</p><p>"I remember a moment when I was getting out of bed and going to the liquor cabinet and taking a big shot at 8:00 in the morning and thinking, 'I have to wake up the kids.'"</p><p>McGraw and Hill, who most recently celebrated their 29th wedding anniversary, share three daughters: Gracie, Maggie and Audrey.</p><p>"I went straight to my wife and said, 'This is where I'm at.'

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Jessica Alba is giving fans a glimpse into her love life. </p><p>The 44-year-old actress shared another Australia photo carousel to Instagram over the weekend. This time, she ended the series of photos with a romantic beachside handhold with 33-year-old "Top Gun: Maverick" star Danny Ramirez.</p><p>Alba opened the post with a photo of her posing on a wooden staircase leading down to the beach, looking relaxed and carefree in a brown strapless set. </p><p>She captioned her post, "Byron Bay [blue heart emoji]." This is the second series of beach pictures she has shared with her followers on Instagram this week.</p><p>However, this marks the first time the couple has appeared together on social media. Alba and Ramirez have been spotted out since May 2025 but have kept quiet about their relationship. </p><p>The pair took a trip south of the Gold Coast, where Alba is filming her new movie "The Mark," to Byron Bay for some romantic quality time away from set. </p><p>After filing for divorce from her husband of 16 years, Cash Warren, in February 2025, according to divorce filings obtained by Fox News Digital, Alba was soon linked to Ramirez. </p><p>The pair first fueled dating rumors in July 2025 after being spotted returning to Los Angeles from a getaway in Cancún, Mexico.

<div class="article-title">Megan Fox makes rare public appearance in blood-dripping gown after giving birth in March</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Megan Fox made a striking return to the spotlight as she showed off a sultry, blood-inspired look at a special screening of her 2009 cult-favorite horror movie "Jennifer’s Body."</p><p>The 39-year-old actress turned heads in a nude corset gown adorned with crimson gem embellishments shaped like droplets, creating the appearance of dripping blood.</p><p>The gems dangled from Fox's lace-up bodice, which featured scarlet boning and a sweetheart neckline. The jewels were also scattered across the dress's sheer tulle skirt, which had an asymmetrical, high-slit design showcasing her legs. </p><p>Fox accessorized with a matching red choker necklace and wore nude-toned transparent heels.</p><p>The "Till Death" star styled her hair down in loose waves and her makeup included smoky eyeliner, peach blush and glossy nude lipstick.</p><p>Fox completed her glamorous gothic look with a blood-red manicure and a dark crimson pedicure.</p><p>The actress's outing marked one of her first public appearances since giving birth to her daughter Saga Blade in March. Fox shares Saga with her ex-fiancé Machine Gun Kelly, 35. She is also mother to sons Noah, 13, Bodhi, 11, and Journey, 9, whom she shares with her ex-husband Brian Austin Green, 52.</p><p>Fox's ensemble paid tribute to her bloodthirsty character in "Jennifer's Body." She played Jennifer Check, a high school cheerleader who becomes possessed by a demonic force after a local rock band sacrifices her in a failed satanic ritual meant to make them famous.</p><p>Jennifer then develops a taste for human flesh and begins seducing and killing teenage boys. Amanda Seyfried played Jennifer's best friend Needy Lesnicki, who slowly realizes what is happening and tries to stop her.</p><p>During a Q&amp;A session after the screening, Fox opened up about her struggles after skyrocketing to fame when she starred in the 2007 hit action movie "Transformers."</p><p>While reflecting on the advice that she would give her younger self ahead of filming "Jennifer's Body," Fox recalled that at the time she was enraged over her treatment by the industry and overwhelmed by the relentless pursuit of the paparazzi.</p><p>"Oh, I don't know that I would give myself advice. I think where I was at that point in my life, so lost, so full of that rage that I had towards how I had been treated in the industry," Fox said, according to People magazine.</p><p>"And how I was dealing with fame and the constant… at that time, before we started filming," she added.</p><p>Fox recounted one instance in which she was taunted by a group of "ruthless" paparazzi after attending a premiere.</p><p>"I just left a premiere for something where I had to go — I'm obligated to go — and I remember the paparazzi were so ruthless back then — the way they would talk to women," Fox remembered.</p><p>"And I walked out just to try to get to my car, and they're all shooting," she continued. "And one guy's like, ‘Megan, why are you such a b----?’ And another guy is like, ‘Megan, do you think you're overrated? The internet says so,’ and I'm just trying to do my job."</p><p>"I was asked to be at this premiere. I'm trying to get to my car. And so I had all of this grief and sorrow and also anger and rage that needed a place to go," Fox continued. "And like I said, being able to just have the permission to be unhinged even in between takes or maybe the entire time we were there, that was very cathartic for me."</p><p>According to People, Fox was reflecting on a moment from earlier at the event in which she explained how she related to Jennifer and how portraying her helped uncover parts of herself she hadn’t previously explored.</p><p>"I read the script and I think it just resonated with me because there's something about that, whether it's just perceived or not, I felt like I was being persecuted at that time in my career, and I was struggling a lot with fame and kind of traumatized by fame," she recalled.</p><p>"And so I resonated with those deeper layers of... you know, before she becomes a monster, she's just a teenage girl who gets sacrificed for somebody else's gain," Fox continued. "And that very much resonated because that's kind of how I got... I came into this industry, I think I was 19 when I made my first big movie, and that, I felt like, was reflecting back these energies that existed inside of myself."</p><p>Fox said that playing the role of the demon-possessed high school girl "also gave me a place to put those qualities of myself that are really unhinged, that are not appropriate to express every day of your life, but are still there nonetheless."</p><p>"And so there was something so fun about getting to tap into that darker feminine energy that no one really wants to allow," she continued.</p><p>"That was very healing for me," Fox said, per People. "Because I was really struggling at that time. And if I had been able to warn myself or give myself advice or have any sort of grounding or clarity, I don't think you would've gotten the performance that you got."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Controversial anti-Israel celebrities Rachel Zegler and Ms. Rachel were named among Glamour magazine's "Women of the Year" on Monday.</p><p>The "Snow White" actress and children's YouTube star were among nine women, including four WNBA players, who were honored by the fashion magazine as "trailblazers, rule breakers, visionaries, and champions who have defined" 2025.</p><p>Despite their controversies, both women received glowing profiles from Glamour, which described Zegler as "young, outspoken, and unwilling to kowtow to parts of the Hollywood machine that might prefer women to sit down, shut up, and be grateful."</p><p>"We just need to normalize our hearts’ not having boundaries," Zegler said in an interview for the magazine. "I think that there’s this idea that we as public figures can’t have thoughts or feelings because we are like paper dolls to a majority of the public."</p><p>Zegler came under fire over the past several years for incendiary social media posts, including an August 2024 message on X where she wrote, "And always remember, free Palestine," in a post about the official trailer for "Snow White." </p><p>She also sparked outrage over a profane Instagram post after the 2024 election, hoping that President Donald Trump and his supporters "never know peace." Zegler later apologized for the post.</p><p>Glamour magazine also praised the YouTube personality Ms. Rachel, whose real name is Rachel Griffin Accurso, for speaking out about Israel's war against Hamas and "saying what many politicians won’t."</p><p>However, she has been criticized on social media for echoing casualty figures from Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p>"Over 14,000 precious children have been un-alived in Gaza. Gaza has the largest number of child amputees in history. We can’t be silent about these kinds of conditions for children," Ms. Rachel wrote in December.</p><p>Those numbers were later revised down by thousands with an analysis finding that 72% of those killed between the ages of 13 and 55 were males.</p><p>During her Glamour interview, Ms. Rachel defended her position and insisted that her support for Palestinian children was not "antisemitic."</p><p>"It’s incredibly painful," she said. "Saying that I don’t care deeply about one group of children because I’m focused on children in an emergency situation isn’t right. It’s not true. My friends know who I am and God knows who I am. But nothing is going to silence me from being an advocate for children because that’s a calling, and it’s the right thing to do. And labeling people because they care deeply about all children is wrong."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Glamour magazine for comment.</p><p>Glamour magazine's "Women of the Year" roster has drawn backlash in the past. In 2023, the magazine was mocked for including transgender model Geena Rocero among its honorees.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The NBA told its 30 teams on Monday it had launched a review into how the league could protect the integrity of the game and its players after two figures were placed on leave for their alleged roles in a gambling scheme, which was investigated by the FBI.</p><p>Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups were among those arrested in the FBI operation. Former NBA player and coach Damon Jones was also arrested.</p><p>"Given the spread of legal betting to the majority of U.S. states, the recurrence of integrity issues across sports, and the emergence of novel betting formats and markets, this is an opportune time to carefully reassess how sports betting should be regulated and how sports leagues can best protect themselves, their players, and their fans," the memo from the NBA’s legal department to the team read, according to The Associated Press.</p><p>Rozier was accused of conspiring with associates to help them win bets based on statistical performance in a game he was playing for the Charlotte Hornets in March 2023.</p><p>Sportsbooks detected an unusual pattern of wagers on the Charlotte game in question, including prop bets involving Rozier. The bets were flagged and immediately brought to the league’s attention. The league initially cleared Rozier of any wrongdoing.</p><p>"While the unusual betting on Terry Rozier’s ‘unders’ in the March 2023 game was detected in real time because the bets were placed legally, we believe there is more that can be done from a legal/regulatory perspective to protect the integrity of the NBA and our affiliated leagues," the league said.</p><p>"In particular, proposition bets on individual player performance involve heightened integrity concerns and require additional scrutiny."</p><p>The league said it would take a look at injury reports as part of its investigation. Jones was accused of tipping off associates to the injury status of LeBron James and Anthony Davis before a Los Angeles Lakers game. There was no indication that James or Davis had any knowledge of what Jones was accused of doing.</p><p>"With sports betting now occupying such a significant part of the current sports landscape, every effort must be made to ensure that players, coaches, and other NBA personnel are fully aware of the dire risks that gambling can impose upon their careers and livelihoods; that our injury disclosure rules are appropriate; and that players are protected from harassment from bettors," the league added.</p><p>A Congressional committee asked NBA Commissioner Adam Silver for a briefing by the end of this week to discuss topics including how "gaps, if any, in existing regulations that allow illegal betting schemes to occur."</p><p>Silver has maintained that he would prefer federal regulation on sports betting instead of the current state-by-state approach.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A heckler questioned King Charles III over Prince Andrew's ties to Jeffrey Epstein during his visit to a cathedral on Monday.</p><p>A man shouted questions at the king outside of Lichfield Cathedral in Staffordshire, England, the BBC reported.</p><p>"How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein? Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew?" the single protester shouted, as captured on video.</p><p>"Should MPs be allowed to debate the royals in the House of Commons?" </p><p>Another video, which appeared to be shot by the heckler, was shared on X by the anti-monarchy group Republic. The group’s mission statement on X reads, "to achieve the abolition of the British monarchy in favor of a democratic republic."</p><p>While the protester voiced his criticism, large crowds of royal supporters were gathered outside to greet King Charles.</p><p>Video shows several people confronting the heckler, with some yelling at him to "shut up," while one woman nearby told him to "go away." King Charles did not respond to the man's questions.</p><p>The monarchy has faced mounting pressure regarding Prince Andrew's connection to Epstein after the late financier's alleged victim Virginia Giuffre released a posthumous memoir.</p><p>This incident comes just days after Prince Andrew relinquished his remaining royal titles. His Royal Highness title has been inactive since 2019. While continuing to "vigorously deny" the accusations against him, Prince Andrew noted in a statement that Giuffre's claims have become a distraction from the work of the royal family.</p><p>"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family," Prince Andrew said in an Oct. 17 statement obtained by Fox News Digital. "I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life."</p><p>While he will no longer be referred to as the Duke of York, Prince Andrew will remain a prince as he is the son of the late Queen Elizabeth. Due to the loss of his title, Prince Andrew will not attend the royal family Christmas celebrations.</p><p>Giuffre's book gave details about her long-standing accusations against Prince Andrew. Giuffre has alleged she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein and had sex with the prince when she was 17.</p><p>Giuffre claimed she had sex with Prince Andrew three times in the memoir titled "Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice."</p><p>"In the years since, I’ve thought a lot about how he behaved," she wrote about the first night she allegedly had sex with Prince Andrew. "He was friendly enough, but still entitled — as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright."</p><p>She claimed she was paid $15,000 by Epstein for having sex with "Randy Andy."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Seven years after the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history, a new documentary shines a light on the brave Pittsburgh first responders who faced unimaginable danger inside the Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018.</p><p>One SWAT officer, Tim Matson, spoke for the very first time after being shot 12 times while confronting the gunman, Robert Bowers, seven years ago.</p><p>"Confronting Hate: Responding to the Tree of Life Attack" also made its debut on the attack's 7th anniversary and offers firsthand accounts of the ordeal from survivors and other officers who broke years of silence imposed during the federal prosecution of Bowers.</p><p>"For five years, the officers were under a gag order from the federal court while they were charging and trying the perpetrator, so some of the emotional trauma for the first responders was never talked about until now," documentary maker Jon Becker told Fox News Digital.</p><p>"None of these officers will ever be completely the same as they were before this and in every single one of their lives," he added.</p><p>"They went into that building knowing this guy could kill them to save people that they've never even met."</p><p>On Oct. 27, 2018, Bowers stormed the Tree of Life building in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood during Shabbat services, targeting congregants from Tree of Life, Dor Hadash, and New Light. </p><p>He was armed with a semi-automatic rifle and handguns and killed 11 worshippers and wounded six others, including four police officers. </p><p>Among those critically wounded was Officer Tim Matson, who engaged the shooter and shared his experience for the first time. Tim was hit 12 times and has since undergone more than 25 surgeries.</p><p>"The suspect barricaded himself in a room like a classroom, turned off the lights, hid behind a barrier, and as soon as Tim entered the room, the suspect opened fire on him," explained Becker, CEO Aardvark Tactical.</p><p>"Physically, he’s a lot better now," Becker added. "He’s walking, but it was months before he walked again."</p><p>But the film’s creators claim "Confronting Hate" is not just about recounting tragedy but about confronting how the country treats those who protect it. </p><p>"We’ve beaten our police down emotionally by focusing on the things they do that are negative," Becker said.</p><p>"We overlook things like this, where the police literally sacrifice themselves to save people."</p><p>The film also highlights two survivors, Dan Legard and Andrea Wender, whose lives were saved when officers like Matson charged into the synagogue under fire. </p><p>"Dan and Andrea are alive because people they didn’t know ran toward danger to pull them out," Becker said.</p><p>Beyond remembrance, the documentary demands change, which Becker explained encompasses not "under investing in law enforcement, financially or in training." </p><p>"If we’re not taking lessons learned and using them to help our law enforcement improve and give them the resources they need, we can’t expect a different result the next time something happens," he said.</p><p>"We also need a more balanced narrative about law enforcement," Becker concluded.</p><p>Bowers, was convicted on all 63 federal counts in 2023 and sentenced to death. </p><p>In a statement on their website today, Tree of Life Congregation said: "We are deeply moved by the outpouring of support for our synagogue from our community and people across the country and around the world in the wake of the horrific anti-Semitic attack of October 27, 2018. We will continue to mourn our lost congregants, even as we honor their memories by healing, growing, and strengthening the congregation they loved. We deeply appreciate the many offers of assistance and support of the victims' families and to help rebuild the Tree of Life synagogue. Your support proves that love is truly stronger than hate."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Dodgers have jumped to a 2-1 lead in the 2025 World Series after a thrilling, back-and-forth, extra-inning contest in Game 3 ended in a 6-5 win for Los Angeles after 18 innings with yet another walk-off home run off the bat of Freddie Freeman.</p><p>Shohei Ohtani led the way for the Boys in Blue, reaching base in all nine of his plate appearances, setting a postseason record and tying an MLB record. He slugged two homers and two doubles, was intentionally walked four times, drew another walk and had three runs driven in, continuing his postseason excellence thus far in October. </p><p>The 18-inning matchup tied for the longest in World Series history, matching the 2018 game between the Boston Red Sox and the Dodgers, which the Boys in Blue won via a Max Muncy walk-off homer before ultimately falling in the series.</p><p>Echoing that history, which happened almost exactly to Monday's date seven years ago —on Oct. 26, 2018 — Freeman launched a walk-off bomb to deep center field, ending the game 6-5. </p><h3>Game breakdown</h3><p>The Dodgers jumped on Toronto starter Max Scherzer early, staking a 1-0 lead with a Teoscar Hernández homer deep to left field. Ohtani tacked on to the lead with his own solo shot in the third inning, ripping a fastball up and in over the right field wall. </p>
<p>Freddie Freeman drew a walk after the Ohtani homer, promptly stealing second base with Dodgers catcher Will Smith at the plate. He lined a single to right field, but Toronto outfielder Addison Barger unfurled a perfect throw home to nab Freeman as he attempted to score. </p>
<p><strong>Game 1: </strong><span class="link"><strong>Toronto Blue Jays rout LA Dodgers in Game 1 of the World Series</strong></span></p><p>The Blue Jays bounced back from the game-tying homer almost immediately, however, when Alejandro Kirk crushed a three-run homer after Los Angeles starter Tyler Glasnow hung a curveball over the plate. Guerrero Jr. prefaced Kirk's at-bat with a walk, which was followed by an error from the Dodgers' second baseman Tommy Edman, who let a Bo Bichette grounder skip under his glove and into right field. </p><p>They added another run on an Andres Gimenez sacrifice fly, giving them a 4-2 lead.</p><p>As expected, Ohtani and the Dodgers answered back quickly. Ohtani's second double of the game scored Kiké Hernández from first base before Freddie Freeman slashed a ball past the diving glove of Vladimir Guerrero Jr., tying the game at 4-4.</p>
<p>In the bottom of the sixth inning, Guerrero Jr. flashed his Gold Glove-winning leather, gunning down Teoscar Hernández with a perfect throw as he attempted to grab an extra base on a Kiké Hernández infield single. It ended the scoring threat and the sixth inning for the Los Angeles offense.</p>
<p>Toronto took another lead in the top of the seventh inning, when a Bo Bichette single down the first base line, paired with savvy base running and an incredible tag-avoiding slide from Guerrero Jr., put them back up 5-4. </p><p><strong>Game 2: </strong><span class="link"><strong>Yamamoto's masterpiece leads Dodgers to World Series Game 2 win, evening series at 1</strong></span></p><p>Ohtani answered for the Dodgers instantly, absolutely crushing a 406-foot home run over the wall in left-center field when Toronto reliever Seranthony Dominguez grooved a 98 mph fastball down the heart of the plate. </p><p>His four extra-base hits tied a World Series record previously set back in the 1906 series between the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox. He now has eight long balls in the postseason and three in the World Series. </p><p>After allowing a walk to Isaiah Kiner-Falefa in his second inning of the contest, Roki Sasaki avoided disaster when a Daulton Varsho liner bounced off of Freddie Freeman's glove. Kiner-Falefa, similar to Teoscar Hernández in the sixth inning, attempted to take third base but was nailed by a perfect throw from Edman. </p><p>Toronto closer Jeff Hoffman was tagged to pitch the bottom of the ninth. He got Andy Pages to pop out to start, after an 11-pitch at-bat, before they intentionally walked Ohtani, who was gunned down upon attempting to steal second base after he slipped while popping out of his slide. Mookie Betts popped out in foul territory, sending the game to extra innings.</p>
<h3>Extra innings</h3><p>The top of the 10th inning ended as Teoscar Hernández and Tommy Edman combined for a perfect relay home, nabbing Davis Schneider, who had singled to reach base, as he attempted to score on a Nathan Lukes double. </p>
<p>Hoffman pitched around trouble in the bottom of the 10th inning, keeping the Dodgers from scoring despite allowing a runner to reach scoring position following a hit by pitch for Smith and a single from Teoscar Hernández.</p><p>Emmett Sheehan pitched a clean 11th inning before the Dodgers came up to bat. They gave Ohtani a free pass again after getting Andy Pages out. Betts singled to move Ohtani into scoring position before Freeman flew out to left field.</p><p>Longtime Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw was called from the bullpen in the top of the 12th inning with two outs and the bases loaded. He got Nathan Lukes to groundout weakly to Edman to end the frame. </p><p>In the bottom of the 13th inning, after Edgardo Henriquez pitched a perfect top of the frame, Tommy Edman slapped a double to right-center field before he was moved to third via sacrifice bunt off the bat of the pinch-hitting Miguel Rojas. The Blue Jays then intentionally walked both Ohtani and Betts, bringing Freeman to the plate with the bases loaded. He flew out to deep center field, narrowly missing hitting a walk-off grand slam in the World Series for the second consecutive year.</p><p>After Henriquez hurled another clean inning to start the 14th inning, the game almost ended off the bat of Will Smith, who crushed a ball to deep left-centerfield, which died just feet before breaching the wall. Max Muncy followed that up in the next at-bat, slapping a long foul ball before drawing a walk.</p><p>Teoscar Hernández singled in the next at-bat, moving Muncy into scoring position before Edman popped out for the second out of the inning. Miguel Rojas grounded out to end the inning. </p><p>Both teams cruised through the 15th, 16th and 17th innings before heading into a record-tying 18th inning. At the same time, Dodgers starter and Game 2 hero Yoshinobu Yamamoto began to warm up in the Dodgers' bullpen, just two days after pitching his second consecutive complete game of the postseason. He never made it into the game, however, as Will Klein dominated the opposition through four innings of shutout ball. </p>
<p>Klein and the Blue Jays' Eric Lauer, both of whom appeared in extra innings, combined to toss 8 and 2/3 innings, maintaining the score at 5-5 throughout their appearances. Klein escaped his dazzling performance with the win after striking out Blue Jays' backup catcher Tyler Heineman with runners on second and third, the first time that Toronto had runners in scoring position since the 12th inning.</p>
<p>Similar to last year's World Series, which the Dodgers won over the New York Yankees, <span class="link">Freddie Freeman played hero</span>, launching a 3-2 pitch from Brendon Little 406 feet over the center field wall, just over the outstretched glove of the leaping Daulton Varsho, sending the Dodger Stadium crowd into an uproar and home with the World Series lead. </p><p>Game 4 is scheduled for 5 p.m. on Tuesday, where none other than Ohtani is slated to take the mound against Toronto's Shane Bieber. </p><h3>Key moments and statistics</h3><p>Dodgers starter Tyler Glasnow went just 4 and 2/3 innings, allowing four runs, two earned, on five hits. He walked three and struck out five. Scherzer went 4 and 1/3 innings, striking out three and allowing three earned runs, two of which came on homers. </p><p>The teams combined to use 19 pitchers during the 17-inning contest. They also combined to leave 37 runners on base, drew 19 walks, struck out 29 times and tallied 31 hits.</p><p>Kershaw's appearance out of the bullpen, with two outs in the top of the 12th, was the first extra-inning appearance of his 18-year career. He's set to retire at the end of the World Series, ending what is surely a Hall of Fame career that came entirely in Los Angeles.</p><p>Freeman's fifth-inning RBI was just his second of the postseason. </p>
<p>Toronto outfielder George Springer, who hit arguably the 2025 postseason's <span class="link">biggest home run</span>, so far,  in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series, left the game in the seventh inning due to an injury. He was replaced by utility player Ty France. Before Game 3, Springer was hitting .375 in the first two games of the World Series. </p>
<h3>Roberto Clemente Award winner</h3><p>Betts was honored with the 2025 Roberto Clemente Award before the game. The award is annually given to the player who "best represents the game of Baseball through extraordinary character, community involvement, philanthropy and positive contributions, both on and off the field," according to Major League Baseball. He's the fourth Dodger to win the award, and first since Justin Turner did so in 2022. </p>

<div class="article-title">Hurricane Melissa inching toward Jamaica as chart-topping Category 5 storm</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Melissa was<span class="link"> inching toward Jamaica as a Category 5</span> hurricane early Tuesday -- the strongest a hurricane can get -- and was expected to bring "catastrophic winds, flooding, and storm surge" to the island before moving on to Cuba and the Bahamas, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center warned.</p><p>But Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major <span class="link">impacts on the mainland United States</span>, but it's turning into the strongest Atlantic system this season.</p><h2>Melissa's forecast and path</h2><p>The storm had maximum sustained winds of 175 mph as of the NHC's latest update early Tuesday. Hurricanes reach Category 5 — the top of <span class="link">the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale</span> — when their winds hit 157 mph. </p><p>Melissa's center was about 135 miles southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, and some 310 miles southwest of Guantanamo, Cuba, as of the latest hurricane center update. Hurricane-force winds extended some 30 miles from the storm's center and tropical storm-force winds extended 195 miles. The storm was moving ever-so-slowly north-northeast at a mere 2 mph.</p><p>"On the forecast track, the core of Melissa is expected to move over Jamaica today, across southeastern Cuba Wednesday morning and across the southeastern or central Bahamas later on Wednesday," the hurricane center said.</p>
<p>"Some fluctuations in intensity are likely before Melissa makes landfall on Jamaica later today. However, Melissa is expected to reach Jamaica and southeastern Cuba as an extremely dangerous major hurricane, and will still be at hurricane strength when it moves across the southeastern Bahamas," the center continued.</p>
<p>When Melissa makes landfall, peak storm surge accompanied by destructive waves is forecast to reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level in Jamaica and 7 to 11 feet in Cuba. </p><p>The storm's extremely slow pace also raises the risk of destructive impacts, particularly in Jamaica.</p><p>"The devastation is going to be so profound because the storm is moving slowly," CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore said. "It's going to remain at a very slow pace as it traverses the island. ... All of the threats that a hurricane can unleash on an island, it's all going to happen in Jamaica."</p>
<p>Melissa could be the most powerful hurricane ever to hit Jamaica.</p><p>"The island's terrain makes it even worse," CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak explained. "Jamaica's mountains force the air to rise, and that creates more rain."   </p><p>The strongest previous hurricane to pound Jamaica was Gilbert in 1988, Kozak said. It killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.</p>
<h2>Hurricane advisories</h2><p>A hurricane warning is in effect for Jamaica and the Cuban provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin and the southeastern and central Bahamas.</p><p>A hurricane watch is up for the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p><p>A tropical storm warning is posted for Haiti, the Cuban province of Las Tunas and for the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p><p>The Naval Station Guantanamo Bay said it was moving "non-mission-essential" U.S. citizens off the island in groups ahead of severe weather from Melissa.</p>
<h2>Rainfall forecasts</h2><p>Melissa is expected to bring 15 to 30 inches of rain to areas of Jamaica and 6 to 12 inches to southern Hispaniola (the island split into Haiti and the Dominican Republic) through Wednesday, with a total of 40 inches possible in some places, the hurricane center said. "Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely," the center emphasized.</p>
<p>For eastern Cuba, total rainfall could reach 10 to 20 inches, with as much as 25 inches in some spots from Monday into Wednesday, which could result in "life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides," the center added.</p><p>And total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected today into Wednesday on the southeastern Bahamas, resulting in areas of flash flooding. </p>
<p>In the southeast Bahamas, forecasters said, a total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches is expected Tuesday into Wednesday, resulting in areas of flash flooding.</p><p>"Catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are probable across portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica," forecasters said.</p><p>Above-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures, made worse by <span class="link">climate change</span>, helped Melissa rapidly intensify into a major storm, according to climate scientists. That translates into stronger winds, heavier rainfall and a higher sea level rise, which would make storm surge more intense.</p><p>Preliminary data from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists monitoring the effects of climate change, suggests that climate change has increased Melissa's wind speed by 10 mph. </p><p>"Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification," Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, told The Associated Press.</p>

<div class="article-title">Hurricane Melissa bearing down on Jamaica as a Category 5</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><span class="link">Hurricane Melissa</span> intensified to Category 5 early Monday as it neared Jamaica, threatening to bring catastrophic flooding, landslides and widespread damage to homes and infrastructure. The storm is forecast to dump up to 30 inches of rain on Jamaica, along with life-threatening storm surge along its southern coast.</p><p>Melissa is expected to make landfall on the island on Tuesday and cross southeastern Cuba and the Bahamas through Wednesday. The U.S. State Department on Monday issued natural disaster travel alerts for Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and the Bahamas, urging U.S. citizens to consider leaving while flights were still available, or be prepared to shelter in place. </p><p>As of the National Hurricane Center's latest update, the hurricane had maximum sustained winds of 175 mph and was inching north-northeast at a slow pace, just 2 mph. </p><p><span class="link">Category 5 is the highest</span> on the Saffir-Simpson scale, for storms with sustained winds of at least 157 mph — catastrophic strength capable of destroying many of the homes in its path.</p>
<p>"Destructive winds and storm surge and catastrophic flooding will worsen in Jamaica through the day and into tonight," CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said Monday. </p>
<p>Melissa is expected to be the most powerful storm to ever hit Jamaica, and, potentially, the most powerful storm on record to ever make landfall anywhere, CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore said Monday. The storm's slow pace, which it was forecast to maintain while traversing Jamaica, increased the likelihood that it would bring "profound" devastation to the island, according to Gilmore.</p><p>"All of the threats that a hurricane can unleash on an island, it's all going to happen in Jamaica over the next 36 hours," he said.</p>
<h2>Melissa forces Hurricane Hunters aircraft to turn around, NOAA says</h2><p>CBS News confirmed that a Hurricane Hunters aircraft from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was forced on Monday to abort its mission when it experienced "severe turbulence" in the storm's southwestern eyewall.</p><p>The crew on one of NOAA's P-3 aircraft, the N42RF "Kermit," experienced the turbulence, which triggered a mandatory maintenance action, and they had to return to the Aircraft Operations Center in Lakeland, Florida, a NOAA spokesman told CBS News. The aircraft underwent inspection and maintenance and was scheduled to continue with planned missions on Monday. Another of NOAA's P-3 aircraft, the N43RF "Miss Piggy," was slated to support flights into Hurricane Melissa starting Tuesday.</p>
<h2>Storm surge in Jamaica could peak up to 13 feet, forecasters say</h2><p>In addition to the rainfall, Melissa is likely to cause a life-threatening storm surge on Jamaica's southern coast, peaking as much as 13 feet above ground level, near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall, forecasters said.</p><p>Mandatory evacuations were ordered in seven flood-prone communities, where buses carried people to shelters, according to Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management there.</p>
<p>In addition to the impact on Jamaica, western Haiti could get 16 inches of rain, bringing the threat of catastrophic flash flooding and landslides there, too, the hurricane center warned. </p><p>The slow-moving storm has already killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing, according to authorities.</p><p>"I want to urge Jamaicans to take this seriously," said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica's Disaster Risk Management Council. "Do not gamble with Melissa. It's not a safe bet."</p>
<p>The hurricane was expected to make another landfall later Tuesday in eastern Cuba, where authorities have ordered some 650,000 people to evacuate, according to the country's president. A hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantánamo and Holguin provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Las Tunas. Up to 20 inches of rain were forecast for parts of Cuba, along with a significant storm surge along the coast.</p><p>Around 1,000 U.S. military personnel have been evacuated from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, ahead of Melissa's arrival, a U.S. defense official told CBS News. Meanwhile, some U.S. Navy ships in the region were repositioned out of the hurricane's direct path but remained actively deployed, the official said.  </p>
<p>Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica's meteorological service, also warned Melissa could be the strongest hurricane Jamaica has experienced in decades. He said cleanup and damage assessment could be severely delayed because of anticipated landslides, flooding and blocked roads.</p><p>"Don't make foolish decisions," warned Daryl Vaz, Jamaica's transport minister. "We are in a very, very serious time over the next few days."</p>
<p>The storm has already dropped heavy rain in the Dominican Republic, where schools and government offices were ordered to remain closed on Monday in four of nine provinces still under red alert. The Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.</p><p>Melissa damaged more than 750 homes across the Dominican Republic, displacing more than 3,760 people and leaving more than half a million without drinking water services, emergency officials said. Floodwaters have also cut access to at least 48 communities, officials said. </p><p>In Haiti, the storm destroyed crops in three regions, including 37 acres of maize, at a time when at least 5.7 million people — more than half the country's population — are experiencing crisis-level hunger, with 1.9 million of those facing emergency-level hunger. </p><p>"Flooding is obstructing access to farmland and markets, jeopardizing harvests and the winter agricultural season," the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization said. </p><p>Melissa was expected to keep dumping torrential rain over southern Haiti and the southern Dominican Republic in the upcoming days.</p>

<html><body><div><article class="content content-article lazyload" data-index="0" data-path="/news/fan-falls-ppg-paints-arena-pittsburgh-penguins/" id="article-0">
<section class="content__body">
<p>A fan suffered life-threatening injuries when he fell from the stands at PPG Paints Arena during Monday night's game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the St. Louis Blues, Pittsburgh Public Safety said. </p><p>The man fell from the 200 level, hitting another person in the suite level below before falling to the 100 level, Pittsburgh Public Safety said in a post on Facebook. The man who fell was taken to a hospital in Pittsburgh with life-threatening injuries, officials said. </p>
<p>The fall happened during the first period on Monday, and play did not stop at any point. First responders were called to the arena around 7:15 p.m., officials said. </p><p>The person struck by the falling man was evaluated by first responders and declined to go to the hospital. In a statement, the Penguins said, in part, that the organization and OVG Management Group, which operates PPG Paints Arena, are "closely monitoring the situation. Our concerns remain with the individual and his family at this time."</p><p>A photo from the area on Monday showed about 10 200-level seats roped off with yellow tape. A pane of glass in the front of the section is also missing. Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the fall. No additional information was released on Monday night. </p>
<p>"We saw a bunch of people scrambling over there ... saw him taken away," witness Devin Voop told KDKA. "Obviously, I hope he's OK."</p>
<p>The incident comes on the heels of a worker at Acrisure Stadium falling 50 feet from the stadium's scoreboard on Saturday night. Authorities said the worker, suffered severe injuries, mainly to his lower extremities, and was listed in critical condition.</p><p>Earlier this year, Kavan Markwood fell 21 feet from his seat onto the warning track at PNC Park during a Pittsburgh Pirates' game against the Chicago Cubs. Doctors said he suffered several injuries, including to his skull, brain, spine, ribs and lungs. But at the time, they said he was recovering ahead of schedule, given the severity of his injuries.</p>

<div class="article-title">Charlie Kirk murder suspect can wear street clothes in court but must be restrained</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A judge ruled Monday that the 22-year-old Utah man charged in the killing of conservative activist <span class="link">Charlie Kirk</span> will be allowed to wear regular clothes at all pretrial hearings but must be physically restrained due to security concerns. </p><p>Attorneys for <span class="link">Tyler Robinson</span> argued that images of him shackled and in jail clothing would spread widely in a case with extensive press coverage and public interest, which they said could prejudice future potential jurors.</p><p>Judge Tony Graf approved limited measures to protect Robinson's presumption of innocence before a trial, agreeing that the case has drawn "extraordinary" public and media attention. </p><p>"Mr. Robinson shall be dressed as one who is presumed innocent," Graf said during a virtual court hearing on Monday.</p><p>Kirk, who was 31, was assassinated on Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University in Orem as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate. </p>
<p>Robinson was <span class="link">charged last month</span> with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, two counts of obstruction of justice, two counts of witness tampering and committing a violent offense in the presence of a child. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray has said they will plan to seek the death penalty. </p><p>While Robinson has no prior criminal history, Judge Graf said Monday that the charges he faces are extremely serious and present safety concerns in the courtroom. It's the court's highest priority to protect the attorneys, court staff and Robinson himself during what could be emotional hearings, Graf said before denying Robinson's request to appear without restraints. He did, however, prohibit members of the media from photographing or filming Robinson's restraints.</p><p>Robinson was <span class="link">arrested on Sept. 12</span> when he showed up with his parents to turn himself in at his hometown sheriff's office in southwest Utah, more than a three-hour drive from Orem. He is being held at the Utah County Jail without bail and hasn't yet entered a plea. </p><p>As law enforcement agencies were scouring the state for the shooter last month, Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby said he received a phone call from a retired deputy saying he knew who killed Kirk. </p>
<p>"He said, 'Hey, I know who Charlie Kirk's shooter is. I know the family through religious association and he's in Washington County now, and we're working on trying to get him to come in voluntarily,'" Brooksby said at the time.</p><p>"He didn't want a big SWAT team hitting his parents' house or his apartment. He was truly fearful of being shot by law enforcement," Brooksby said. "So the conditions were as relaxed and comfortable and almost to the point of inviting. And if at the end of the day we accomplish him surrendering peacefully on his own, I'm going to make some concessions to make that happen."</p><p>Two federal law enforcement sources previously confirmed to CBS News that <span class="link">Robinson's father saw the photos</span> released by authorities and confronted his son. Robinson admitted to being the person in the photos and said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, prompting his father to call a youth pastor close to the family, the sources said.</p><p>Authorities said Robinson had allegedly <span class="link">confessed to the killing in text exchanges with his roommate</span>. A spokesperson for Discord <span class="link">also previously confirmed</span> to CBS News that Robinson appeared to admit to committing the shooting in messages he had posted to the social media platform. </p><p>Judge Graf ordered Robinson to appear on Jan. 16 and Jan. 30, 2026, for his first in-person public hearings. He appeared Monday from jail on a blacked-out screen and spoke only to confirm he was present.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump meets with Japanese prime minister as Asia tour continues</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Washington — President Trump formally signed a trade agreement with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday, as he looks to cement deals with key U.S. trading partners during his nearly weeklong trip through Asia.</p><p>The deal — which the two countries struck over the summer — <span class="link">calls for the U.S. to charge</span> 15% tariffs on Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by Mr. Trump. In exchange, Japan pledged to invest $550 billion in U.S. industry and open its market to American rice, cars and defense equipment. It's not yet clear exactly where those invested dollars would go.</p><p>The two leaders also signed a framework that calls for the U.S. and Japan to cooperate on supplying critical minerals and rare earth metals to each other. Mr. Trump has sought mineral deals with countries such as <span class="link">Australia</span> and <span class="link">Ukraine</span> in recent months as China imposes new restrictions on exports of rare earths, which are essential for computer chips, aerospace and other technology. </p><p>During brief remarks to the press before a signing ceremony Tuesday morning local time, Mr. Trump touted the trade deal as "very fair."</p><p>"We're going to do tremendous trade together, I think more than ever before," Mr. Trump said, calling Japan an "ally at the strongest level."</p>
<p>Japan is the United States' fifth-largest trading partner, according to federal statistics. Japan bought $79.7 billion worth of American goods last year, and the U.S. imported $148.2 billion worth of Japanese goods.</p><p>More than one-third of U.S. imports from Japan last year — or $52.3 billion — were cars and car parts, powered by Japan's massive auto industry, according to federal data.</p><p>The American and Japanese leaders — whose countries have a shared rivalry with China — also spoke about defense cooperation, with Mr. Trump thanking Japan for its weapons orders from the U.S. During the meeting Tuesday, which was held at Tokyo's Akasaka Palace guest house, Takaichi called the U.S.-Japan relationship the "greatest alliance in the world," and said she would like to work with the U.S. toward a "shared goal of achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific."</p><p>The meeting between Mr. Trump and the Japanese prime minister is their first — Takaichi only took office last week. The first female leader of Japan, Takaichi was close with the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a friend of Mr. Trump's up until <span class="link">his assassination in 2022</span>.</p>
<p>In a moment of levity, Takaichi apologized to reporters for a late start to the meeting, saying she was watching game three of the World Series. The Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star, Shohei Ohtani, is a native of Japan and has a large following in his home country.</p><p>On Monday, the president met with Japanese Emperor Naruhito at Tokyo's imperial palace. Later Tuesday, he's expected to deliver remarks aboard the USS George Washington at Yokosuka Naval Base and attend a business leadership reception.</p><h2>Trump to visit South Korea next — and meet with China's Xi Jinping</h2><p>South Korea is the next and final stop on the president's trip, which started over the weekend in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — a visit marked by trade frameworks between the U.S. and Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.</p><p>On the South Korean front, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he doesn't expect to finalize a trade deal with the country when the U.S. president visits on Wednesday, but said he thinks they're close. Mr. Trump and the South Korean government <span class="link">announced</span> a framework over the summer that was similar to the Japan deal, with 15% tariffs on South Korean goods and investments pledged in the U.S.</p><p>The multi-stop Asia trip will culminate with a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday at a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, as they look to put an end to the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. </p><p>On his way to Tokyo, Mr. Trump <span class="link">predicted</span> the U.S. and China would complete a trade agreement before he returns to Washington later in the week. The two sides have had a rocky relationship in recent months. The president <span class="link">threatened to impose</span> an additional 100% tariff on imports from China — for a total rate of 140% — starting Saturday, Nov. 1, lashing out against <span class="link">new export restrictions</span> imposed by Beijing.</p><p>On his way to Tokyo, Mr. Trump also said he <span class="link">would like to meet</span> with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, although there are no such plans for a meeting.</p>

<div class="article-title">What's known about the reclusive donor offering to help pay troops amid shutdown</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Last week, President Trump announced an anonymous "patriot" had given a donation of $130 million  — money the president said was to be used to help pay troops during the <span class="link">government shutdown</span>. </p><p>There are questions about the legality of a donation of this sort (the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from exceeding congressional appropriations or accepting voluntary services). Over the weekend, The New York Times identified the anonymous donor as Timothy Mellon, a reclusive railroad magnate and heir to the Gilded Age Mellon family fortune. </p>
<p>Mellon, 83, emerged as one of the top Republican donors only in the past few years, giving far less in the decades before 2017.</p><p>Anna Massoglia, a campaign finance researcher, told CBS News, "Timothy Mellon was a relatively unknown political donor but his contributions have surged in recent years, putting him in the very top ranks of political contributors." </p><p>Early in his adult life, he held liberal views on race, the problem of income inequality and the environment. As Mellon's business career evolved, he began to express a strong antipathy for what he viewed as intrusive government regulations on business. One turning point seems to be when he ran afoul of environmental regulators in Connecticut in the late 1990s over an airport he bought. </p>
<p>He's written a memoir and penned some opinion pieces that offer some insight into his political views. Mellon wrote that a favorite quote of his came from Winston Churchill: "Show me a young Conservative and I'll show you someone with no heart. Show me an old Liberal and I'll show you someone with no brains."</p><p>Mellon did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Here are some numbers associated with Mellon:</p><h2>At least $197 million: How much Mellon donated to Trump and Republicans in the 2024 election</h2><p>Mellon may be an obscure figure to the wider public, but he's well known in political circles for giving more than virtually any other donor to Mr. Trump and other Republican committees during the 2024 election cycle — at least $197 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. The only person who gave more was SpaceX and Tesla CEO <span class="link">Elon Musk</span>.</p>
<p>He emerged on the political scene as a megadonor relatively late in life. Over two decades, from 1996 to 2017, he gave a total of $350,000 in donations to political candidates. But in the four years between January 2020 and June 2024 he gave $227 million to federal candidates and political committees.  </p><p>Last year, Mellon made a $50 million donation to a Trump-affiliated super PAC, one of the largest individual contributions ever made public. That was one of several donations to the super PAC during the 2024 election cycle, totaling around $150 million. He also contributed $13 million to the Sentinel Action Fund, a super PAC affiliated with the conservative Heritage Foundation, which produced <span class="link">Project 2025</span>, the policy blueprint the Trump administration has relied on in overhauling the federal government.  </p><h2>$25 million: How much Mellon gave to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign</h2><p>Mellon also gave $25 million to support <span class="link">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s</span> 2024 presidential campaign. Some speculated that Mellon was trying to be a spoiler to help Mr. Trump, whom he was also backing financially. </p><p>But last August, he wrote an article in the American Spectator explaining his support for Kennedy. Mellon, it turns out, is a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic. "I could not fathom how a 'vaccine' could be foisted on the general public with so little (if any) adequate testing." </p><p>He began giving to Kennedy's <span class="link">Children's Health Defense</span>, which promotes false information about vaccines, and later to the Super PAC supporting Kennedy's campaign.</p><h2>$14.1 billion: The Mellon family's estimated wealth</h2><p>Timothy Mellon, the grandson of banker and industrialist Andrew Mellon, was estimated by Forbes to be worth about $1 billion last year, though he told Forbes in an email at the time that he was not a billionaire, writing, "never have been, never will be." The estimated wealth of his family, including other branches, was estimated in 2024 by Forbes to be $14.1 billion. </p><h2>340: The number of trees he cut down at a Connecticut airport he bought</h2><p>One defining episode for Mellon occurred after he purchased an airport in Connecticut in the late 1990s. He cut down 340 trees, arguing that they posed a danger to pilots landing their planes. But state environmental regulators ultimately sued him and won. He was ordered to pay tens of thousands of dollars in damages.</p>
<h2>$53 million: How much he donated to build a border wall in Texas</h2><p>In 2021, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced Texas would build its own border wall and started his own private fund to build it. He made little progress — the Texas Tribune said his effort had slowed after raising a little over $1 million, and then Mellon chipped in $53 million. The private and public effort was quietly dropped earlier this year, as the GOP-led legislature defunded construction in June, and the crowdfunding link disappeared in late May, the Tribune reported. The state built about 65 miles of wall out of the 805 miles that Abbott planned, and it's riddled with gaps because many landowners do not want the border wall on their land.</p>

<div class="article-title">Here's what federal workers should know about back pay</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Some federal workers who are not being paid during the <span class="link">government shutdown</span> have a nagging fear: They might not receive retroactive pay once the impasse is resolved.</p><p>Roughly 1.4 million federal employees <span class="link">whose wages are being withheld</span> during the government shutdown are <span class="link">hunkering down</span> and cutting all nonessential spending, as they missed their first full paychecks on Friday. </p><p>Here's what to know about retroactive pay for those workers when the shutdown ends. </p><h2>Do all federal workers get back pay?</h2><p>Both furloughed workers and so-called "excepted" government employees, who must continue to show up to work during the shutdown without compensation, are entitled to back pay under a federal law called the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019.</p><p>The law makes clear that both classes of federal employees affected by a lack of funding will eventually be paid in full. They "shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations, and each excepted employee who is required to perform work during a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for such work, at the employee's standard rate of pay."</p>
<h2>Legal challenges</h2><p>However, a <span class="link">draft memo</span> from the White House's Office of Management and Budget suggests that furloughed workers are not guaranteed back pay, an administration official confirmed to CBS News. When asked on Oct. 7 about furloughed workers getting back pay, President Trump said, "I would say <span class="link">it depends</span> on who we're talking about."</p><p>Legal experts insist that federal employees are unequivocally protected under the 2019 law. In an Oct. 7 statement, Max Stier, CEO of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said the act "is very clear in its mandate to give automatic back pay to furloughed workers during a lapse in appropriations."</p><p>Dan Meyer, a partner at Tully Rinckey in Washington, D.C., said the law appropriates, not authorizes, back pay for workers. </p><p>"If this came to a judge, I think the appropriations language would speak heavily that they were required to pay the federal employees based on that legislation," he told CBS News. </p>
<p>The memo also contradicts previous guidance published in September by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</p><p>"The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates," the agency's notice read. However, an updated version of guidelines strikes that language. </p><p>"Excepted employees will be paid for any earned overtime pay or holiday premium pay when appropriations are enacted," the OPM now states in its guidance.</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' question about whether or not federal workers will be paid once the shutdown ends.</p><h2>When would back pay arrive?</h2><p>The short answer is as soon as the government shutdown ends. </p><p>The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act stipulates that federal workers are owed back pay "at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates."</p><p>Michael LeRoy, professor of labor and employment relations at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign college of law, told CBS News, "The law makes clear that they are entitled to back pay, and it preferences automatic payment." </p>
<p>Federal workers' last partial paycheck arrived on Oct. 10. Their next pay day was scheduled for Oct. 24. Workers were not paid. Paychecks have yet to be issued, as the second-longest government shutdown in history entered its 27th day Saturday, with <span class="link">no resolution on the horizon</span>.</p><h2>What about government contractors?</h2><p>In addition to federal employees, the government contracts with private sector firms who employ millions of workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. They are not similarly guaranteed back pay. </p><p>"Contract workers are simply not covered by the statute," LeRoy said. </p><p>They may, however, continue to work and receive paychecks if their assigned contracts are fully funded. </p><h2>What about workers who collect unemployment during the shutdown?</h2><p>Federal employees may be eligible for unemployment compensation during the shutdown. The Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program provides benefits to federal workers "who lost their employment through no fault of their own," according to a fact sheet.</p><p>Benefits are available for 26 weeks, with maximum amounts varying by state law, according to an Office of Personnel Management memo. </p><p>When workers are paid retroactively, the funds are applied against any unemployment benefits they received to avoid overpayment, the memo states. Excepted workers are not considered unemployed and therefore are not eligible for unemployment benefits in most states, Tom Spiggle, employment attorney and founder of the Spiggle Law Firm, told CBS News. </p>

<div class="article-title">Iowa soybean farmers lost China as a buyer. Cattle was their backup plan.</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>After several years of losing money on cattle, Burleen and Pete Wobeter thought this would finally be the year things turned around. Their Iowa farm also grows corn and soybeans — crops that have been <span class="link">hit hard</span> by the trade war with China — but cattle had been a bright spot so far in 2025. </p><p>"This year, it is the one thing that is going to make any money for us," Burleen said.</p><p>That's why they were astounded when President Trump announced he wanted to quadruple <span class="link">beef imports</span> from Argentina, claiming it would "bring our beef prices down" and help "a very good ally." </p><p>His words sent wholesale cattle prices plummeting.</p><p>"I thought the whole point of tariffs was to bring production back home, and now he is trying to do something to destroy that production," Burleen said, adding, " It feels like being a pawn in a game we're not going to win."</p>
<p>"We're being used and abused as producers," Pete added.</p><p>For farmers across the U.S., this harvest season brought a new kind of uncertainty. China, once the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, cut off purchases after tariffs escalated, leaving producers with full silos and falling prices. </p><p>The Wobeters were hoping stronger cattle prices could make up for those losses.</p><p>But while cattle ranchers are earning less, <span class="link">shoppers aren't seeing any savings</span>. Ground beef is up nearly 13% and steak is up 16% over the past year, according to federal data. Economists say the spike is tied to drought, high feed costs and a shrinking U.S. cattle herd — now at its lowest level in decades.</p>
<p>Bryan Whaley, CEO of the Iowa Cattlemen's Association, said more imports from Argentina won't fix that. </p><p>"You have to look at the total supply chain," Whaley said. "It really only is gonna be about 2.5% of our total beef supply. So it's really not going to make a substantial difference."</p><p>To help farmers and ranchers weather the downturn, the Trump administration <span class="link">announced last week</span> it would release about $3 billion in assistance by tapping a fund used in Mr. Trump's first term to aid farmers, officials told CBS News.  </p><p>The Trump administration has discussed offering upward of <span class="link">$10 billion in relief</span> to farmers, CBS News reported earlier this month. That potential aid package is on the back burner due to the shutdown, and is separate from the $3 billion in new assistance, a senior administration official said.</p><p>At the same time, the administration recently hinted that new trade agreements could also help turn things around for soybean farmers. <span class="link">Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"</span> that new deals, including one with China, would be positive for U.S. agriculture. </p><p>"Soybean farmers are going to be extremely happy with this deal for this year and for the coming years," he said.</p><p>During his Asia trip, Mr. Trump said he expected the <span class="link">new trade deal with China</span> to be finalized in the coming days.</p>

<div class="article-title">Soaring electricity bills squeeze households as utilities hike rates</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Over the past year, Suzann Hernandez and Camilo Aguirre have put a lot of effort into lowering their energy bill. Beyond <span class="link">simple solutions</span> like turning off lights or closing doors when either the heat or AC was on, the couple insulated their windows and kept the temperature set at a strict 76 degrees, even on the hottest days of summer. </p><p>Despite their best efforts, however, their energy savings strategy had little impact against a rate hike that went into effect in their home state of New Jersey on June 1. The increase, approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities in February, raised the average electric bill for residents in the state by 17%, according to a letter the state's largest utility company sent to customers earlier this year. </p><p>"We thought [we'd] see at least a $50 decrease," Hernandez told CBS News' correspondent Tom Hanson. "When we compared it to what we got this year, we only saw a $20 decrease."</p><p>It's not only residents in the Garden State who are feeling the pinch of higher prices. </p><p>"This is a national problem," Dan Cassino, a professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University, told CBS News. </p>
<p>According to a new report from PowerLines, a nonprofit focused on lowering utility bills, utility rate increase requests and approvals totaled more than $34 billion in the first three quarters of 2025. That's almost double the $16 billion in requests and approvals over the same period in 2024. </p><p>Those rate hikes are expected to show up in the bills of over 124 million customers this year, PowerLines found. For those Americans already struggling to make ends meet the hikes will mean additional economic hardship, the organization said in its report. </p><p>By and large, customers nationwide are feeling powerless in the face of the escalating energy costs. </p><p>"It feels like there's nothing we can do about it," said Karin Gudal, an AES Ohio customer quoted in PowerLines report. "We can try to make our buildings as energy efficient as we can...but even that takes money."</p>
<p>Data shows that utility prices for American households have continued to climb. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, residential electricity prices this year were up 11% in August from January.</p><p>Politicians, meanwhile, are using their campaign platforms to cater to frustrated voters.</p><p>In New Jersey, for example, rising energy prices is an issue gubernatorial race candidates have latched onto in the lead up to elections on Nov. 4. In their campaign ads, both Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill and Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli promise they will help curb energy bills if elected. </p><p>Cassino expects the issue, which has <span class="link">consumed the political race</span> in New Jersey, will soon reverberate in races throughout the country. </p><p>"This is a harbinger of what's gonna happen next year in the midterm elections," he said. "This issue's not going to go away. It's not like the power bills are going to go down."</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump administration to reassign ICE officials in bid to intensify deportation campaign</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Trump administration is staging a major shake-up at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with plans to reassign senior leaders in agency offices across the country amid frustrations over current arrest and deportation levels, two sources familiar with the changes told CBS News on Monday. </p><p>One U.S. official, who requested anonymity to talk about internal matters, said as many as roughly a dozen local ICE leaders could be reassigned, with some expected to be replaced by current or former officials at Customs and Border Protection, its sister Department of Homeland Security agency. Some of those ICE officials have already been informed of their reassignments, the official added.</p><p>The planned shake-up at ICE would be a major leadership overhaul, affecting roughly half of the agency's 25 field offices.</p><p>In most cases, the field office directors won't be demoted or fired, said two U.S. officials, who described the plan as a way to give certain ICE offices additional support.</p><p>The Trump administration has increasingly turned to CBP and Border Patrol officials like Commander <span class="link">Gregory Bovino</span> to expand its government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration, deploying them to apprehend unauthorized immigrants far away from the U.S.-Mexico border, in Democratic-led cities like Chicago and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Operations by green-uniformed Border Patrol agents in those cities — including arrests at Home Depot parking lots and worksites like car washes — have triggered significant local backlash, with critics <span class="link">accusing the agents</span> of being heavy-handed and arresting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally but without criminal records.</p><p>In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, "While we have no personnel changes to announce at this time, the Trump Administration remains laser focused on delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country."</p><p>Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said, "The President's entire team is working in lockstep to implement the President's policy agenda, and the tremendous results from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens speak for themselves."</p><p>The Washington Examiner reported on the reassignments earlier Monday.</p>
<p>Internally, U.S. officials tell CBS News, some ICE leaders have been frustrated with Border Patrol's operations in cities — and the opposition they have garnered from local residents. While the Trump administration has made anyone in the U.S. illegally who is encountered by federal officials subject to arrest, ICE says its operations have continued to primarily target immigrants who have committed crimes in addition to being in the country unlawfully.</p><p>"We're arresting criminals, while they are going to Home Depots and car washes," one U.S. official told CBS News, referring to Border Patrol agents.</p><p>Some inside the Trump administration, however, see Border Patrol officials as better equipped to carry out the aggressive and expansive operations needed to reach the ambitious arrest targets set by the White House.</p><p>In the spring, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the architect of President Trump's mass deportation plans, suggested on Fox News that ICE should be carrying out "a minimum" of 3,000 arrests per day. ICE officials have not met that target. While they have peaked above 2,000 on some days, arrests by the agency typically hover over 1,000 each day.</p><p>As of this week, ICE had carried out more than 260,000 arrests under the second Trump administration, or an average of approximately 900 per day, according to internal agency data obtained by CBS News.</p><p>In less than a year, the Trump administration has shuffled ICE's leadership several times.</p><p>Caleb Vitello, the first official tapped to lead ICE under the second Trump administration, was reassigned in February and replaced by longtime agency veteran Todd Lyons, who continues to serve as acting director. Previous heads of ICE's deportation unit, Enforcement and Removal Operations, and its investigative branch, Homeland Security Investigations, have also been replaced in recent months.</p>
<p>ICE has not had a Senate-confirmed director since early 2017, under the Obama administration.</p>

<div class="article-title">Why Hurricane Melissa's intensity and slow-moving speed are a recipe for disaster</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A powerful hurricane is barreling toward Jamaica with anticipation that it will be the strongest storm to hit the Caribbean island in modern history.</p> <p>Hurricane Melissa began rapidly intensifying over the weekend. It is expected to make landfall early Tuesday morning in Jamaica, threatening to trigger severe flooding and catastrophic landslides, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Not only will the storm be strong, but its slow-moving pace across the Caribbean will likely worsen its impacts.</p>
<p>Melissa is also forecast to strike parts of Cuba and the Bahamas later this week. The U.S. is not expected to be affected.</p> <p>As of Monday evening, Melissa was a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, meaning sustained wind speeds will be 157 miles per hour or greater and catastrophic damage will occur. </p> <p>The prime minister of Jamaica, Andrew Holness, said the country has taken precautionary measures to minimize the impact of a Category 5 storm, such as relocating residents to safety and organizing recovery efforts.</p> <p>"There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5," he said at a press conference on Monday.</p>
<p>Jamaica is expected to be in the storm's eyewall, which refers to the band of dense clouds surrounding the eye of the hurricane. The eyewall generally produces the fiercest winds and heaviest rainfall, according to Deanna Hence, a professor of climate, meteorology and atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.</p> <p>"Unfortunately for them, it looks like it's going to get the most intense part," she said.</p> <p>Part of the threat posed by Melissa lies in its intensity combined with its slow pace.</p> <p>"When you have a very slow-moving hurricane, it essentially means that one particular location will experience all of those hurricane force impacts for a longer period of time," Hence added.</p>
<p>A similar event took place in Texas in 2017. Hurricane Harvey's slow movement across the state unleashed more than 50 inches of rain and resulted in at least 89 deaths.</p> <p>The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Melissa could dump up to 30 inches of rain on Jamaica. According to the National Weather Service, 18 to 24 inches of fast-moving rain can carry away most large SUVs and trucks.</p>
<p>Another concern is the island's mountainous terrain, which can cause heavy rainfall to pick up speed as it flows downhill, increasing the risk of flash flooding and landslides.</p> <p>According to the NHC, eastern Cuba could receive up to 20 inches of rain while the southeast Bahamas is forecast to see up to 10 inches of rainfall. Parts of southwestern Haiti and the southern portions of the Dominican Republic are also at risk of flash flooding and landslides.  </p> <p>Hurricane season is underway, but climate change is also making larger, more powerful storms more common. Research suggests that slow-moving tropical storms have become more common over the past several decades.</p>

<div class="article-title">Your favorite band has a new single? It might be AI</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>It wasn't how Los Angeles musician Luke Temple had expected to start his Monday.</p> <p>Temple was the frontman of indie rock band Here We Go Magic, which has not released music since 2015, a fact that made the flurry of messages hitting his inbox quite baffling.</p> <p>"I woke up to DMs on Instagram saying, 'Apparently Here We Go Magic released a new track?' Sure doesn't sound like you,'" Temple said. "Then I realized it was on Spotify, Tidal, YouTube, all the streaming platforms."</p> <p>The song, which bears no resemblance to the band's psychedelic-inspired airy sound of synthesizers and swirling guitars, is the work of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Accompanying the song, which is called "Water Spring Mountain," is an illustration of a waterfall. That, too, appears to be an AI creation.</p> <p>Welcome to being a musical artist in 2025, when streaming platforms are being bombarded with AI-generated spam and AI tricksters are trying to capitalize on the reputation of an inactive band, or even dead artists, to make a quick buck.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, an AI-generated song was uploaded to the page of Uncle Tupelo, Wilco singer Jeff Tweedy's former band. The same happened to electro-pop artist Sophie, who died in 2021. And the country music singer Blaze Foley, who died in 1989, had his Spotify page vandalized with AI songs.</p> <p>"This is by no means a new problem," said Charley Kiefer, who heads digital account strategy at the music label Secretly Canadian, which released Here We Go Magic's albums. "But it's one that's likely to become increasingly prevalent without remediation from both plug and play distributors and DSPs," he said, referring to digital service providers like Spotify.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Targeting dormant bands with AI songs to 'collect some pennies'</h3> <p>Most of the AI songs emulating real artists are far from persuasive.</p> <p>The AI track imitating Here We Go Magic starts with an acoustic guitar strum that sounds like a computer imitating pop-rock over the lyrics: "I know just how to whisper your melody on the breeze," which would not fool any fans of Temple's music.</p>
<p>But if the motivation is to make some trifling amount of money, it may have succeeded.</p> <p>Recording artists, of course, will be quick to tell you that you'd have to reproduce that tactic on an industrial scale to ever eke out a living.</p> <p>Temple says if the strategy is to target bands and artists who haven't released music in years, the AI scammers could likely do this quite a lot before getting caught.</p> <p>"It makes sense to go after a band like us, because who's to say we're even checking or paying attention," Temple said. "It seems like they could be doing this to smaller bands, or dormant bands, to cast a really wide net and collect some pennies hoping nobody will notice."</p> <p>When NPR reached out to Spotify about the AI song, a company spokesman said it would soon be removed from Here We Go Magic's artist profile.</p>
<p>The spokesman pointed to Spotify's new AI protections for artists and music producers, which includes stepped up enforcement of AI impersonators, like in this case.</p> <p>The platform admits it is fighting against a ceaseless torrent of AI slop. Spotify says it has removed 75 million "spammy" tracks from the platform just in the past year.</p> <p>"Because music flows through a complex supply chain, bad actors sometimes exploit gaps to push incorrect content onto artist profiles," the Spotify spokesman told NPR.</p> <p>Tidal confirmed to NPR it removed the song, saying it's reflective of a broader problem plaguing music services. </p> <p>"All platforms are dealing with an influx of AI tracks being submitted via 3rd party distributors. We are working on better ways to identify, tag, and when necessary remove AI content," a Tidal spokesperson said. </p> <p>YouTube did not return requests for comment.</p> <p>The Spotify spokesman noted that the platform recently launched a tool allowing artists to report mismatched releases before songs go live.</p>
<p>But as with all online scams and spam, it's a cat-and-mouse game, now newly supercharged by AI tools.</p> <p>Part of the challenge is that music labels and artists do not upload songs directly to platforms like Spotify.</p> <p>Instead, independent distribution services, such as DistroKid and TuneCore, serve as middlemen, often sending songs to streaming services without any authentication process.</p> <p>The lax rules are being abused by people using services like Suno and Udio, where anyone can make an AI song that attempts to mimic a real artist in a matter of seconds. As more AI companies develop similar AI music generators to stay competitive, the ability to instantly create an AI song will be in even more hands.</p> <p>Los Angeles musician Temple said it's not just about a spammy AI song taking away a fraction of a cent from the band with every play, it's the shameless identity theft that's the real travesty.</p> <p>"It's so predatory, and so terrible," he said. "The principle of it is so awful. We worked our asses off for a decade and barely made any money as it is."</p>

<p>Social media can push us to the dark side with negative content. A new study finds watching inspiring videos for just three minutes a day can boost your mood and reduce stress.</p>

<p>JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: </p><p> If your social media feed is stressing you out, you are not alone. Algorithms want to keep you engaged so they can push you content that makes you mad, but there might be alternatives to just logging off. NPR's Allison Aubrey reports on a study that shows potential benefits to a few minutes of daily inspiration.</p><p>ALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: What if the first thing that pulled you in this morning was the story of a cancer survivor with one functioning lung who climbed Mount Everest?</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>SEAN SWARNER: I visualized myself every night for a year standing on top of the mountain.</p><p>AUBREY: Sean Swarner's story has been viewed millions of times. He survived Hodgkin lymphoma and, at one stage, struggled to walk. Then he started training.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>SWARNER: I went up and down Longs Peak once a week with 100 pounds of rocks in my backpack to train.</p><p>AUBREY: Watching someone succeed against the odds can feel good. Researcher Robin Nabi of UC Santa Barbara and her collaborators wanted to document the effects, so they found a bunch of viral videos with underdog themes, including Swarner's. And they recruited a thousand adults across the country, from college-aged to 86.</p><p>ROBIN NABI: One group watched an inspiring video, about a three- to five-minute video every day for five days.</p><p>AUBREY: Others watched comedy, while another group watched no media and another did a few minutes of meditation.</p><p>NABI: People felt more hopeful after watching the inspiring videos, and that hope predicted lower stress over the next 10 days.</p><p>AUBREY: It turns out comedy didn't move the needle much on hopefulness. And another thing they didn't expect?</p><p>NABI: We were actually quite surprised at how similar the effects of the inspiring videos were to the group that meditated. Both groups felt more hope, and both groups, that hope predicted reduced stress 10 days later.</p><p>AUBREY: It's not as if watching a few videos will have a massive effect on your long-term well-being.</p><p>NABI: These small effects can accrue over time, and that hope helps us feel like we're able to deal with the things that might be causing us stress. So the question for us really is what happens when we make this a habit?</p><p>AUBREY: It can be tough to choose inspiring content, whether it's on your streaming apps or social media feeds. Researcher Allison Eden of Michigan State University says her research shows when people are not happy, they tend to choose negative content.</p><p>ALLISON EDEN: Something like a horror film, so those people aren't always the best at making decisions for themselves when they're in a bad mood or under stress.</p><p>AUBREY: And when it comes to social media, Eden says it's all too easy to fall to the dark side. There's so much content pushed at us that doesn't make us feel good.</p><p>EDEN: Media can be a super powerful tool for coping and mood management, but we have to really proactively choose that. And if we don't, then we're going to keep getting fed stuff that makes us miserable and sad because that's what prolongs our attention on the apps.</p><p>AUBREY: So, she says, you can intentionally try to counterprogram your feed.</p><p>EDEN: Make an effort that the first couple things that you search for every day are things that are going to put you in a positive frame for the rest of the day. So it could be positive news. It could be animals - something that sort of seeds your feed in a specific way.</p><p>AUBREY: And, she says, you can also try keeping a media log. Every time you watch something, ask yourself how you feel. After a few weeks, you can be the judge of how what you watch or scroll influences your well-being.

<div class="article-title">A Confederate statue toppled in Washington, D.C., in 2020 has been reinstalled</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A statue of the Confederate general Albert Pike that was pulled down and set ablaze in Washington, D.C. in June 2020 during the Black Lives Matter movement has been renovated and reinstalled in Judiciary Square. The reinstallation on Saturday was a follow-through of an earlier National Park Service announcement that the federal government intended to restore the statue, which it says had been damaged in "riots."</p> <p>The monument to Pike was first erected in 1901, but has long been a contentious issue within the nation's capital.</p> <p>The Pike statue is the only monument within Washington, D.C. to honor a Confederate general – but it does not mention his military history. Pike, who was a Freemason and was pardoned by President Andrew Johnson, has also been identified by historians as possibly having been involved with the development of the Ku Klux Klan in the period after the Civil War.</p>
<p>The plaque at the base of the statue, which was originally mounted by the Freemasons, calls Pike an "author, poet, scholar, soldier, jurist, orator, philanthropist and philosopher."</p> <p>Members of the D.C. Council, the district's legislature, have been calling for the statue's removal since 1992.</p>
<p>In an unsigned statement sent to NPR on Monday, the National Park Service wrote: "The National Park Service announced on Aug. 4, 2025 that it will restore and reinstall the bronze statue of Albert Pike, which was damaged and vandalized during the Black Lives Matter riots in June 2020. The restoration aligns with federal responsibilities under historic-preservation law and recent executive orders to beautify the nation's capital and restore pre-existing statues."</p> <p>In a statement released Monday, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) objected to the statue's reinstallation, calling it "an affront to the mostly Black and Brown residents of the District of Columbia and offensive to members of the military who serve honorably."</p> <p>"Pike himself served dishonorably. He took up arms against the United States, misappropriated funds, and was ultimately captured and imprisoned by his own troops," Norton continued. "He resigned in disgrace after committing a war crime and dishonoring even his own Confederate military service. Confederate statues should be placed in museums as historical artifacts, not remain in parks or other locations that imply honor. Pike represents the worst of the Confederacy and has no claim to be memorialized in the Nation's capital." In August, Norton introduced a bill to remove the Pike statue permanently.</p>

<div class="article-title">In Cameroon, the world's oldest leader claims victory -- again</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>YAOUNDÉ, Cameroon —  In a widely disputed election that has sparked protests across the country, Cameroon's president — the world's oldest head of state — has claimed an unprecedented eighth term in office.</p> <p>Paul Biya, 92, has ruled the Central African nation since 1982. On Monday, the Constitutional Council declared him the winner with 53.7% of the vote, compared to 35.2% for opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary.</p> <p>If he serves out his new seven-year term, Biya would remain in power until nearly he was nearly 100-years-old.</p> <p>The country of 30 million — on the world's youngest continent — has a median age of just 19. Most Cameroonians have known only one president, who rarely appears in public and spends long stretches abroad, particularly in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Cameroon faces multiple crises: jihadist violence in the north, a separatist insurgency in the west, and entrenched corruption.</p> <p>While supporters gathered to celebrate at the Constitutional Council in the capital, Yaoundé, Biya remained as elusive as ever. During the campaign he made only one public appearance, and by Monday night he had yet to address the nation, instead releasing a brief written statement.</p> <p>Meanwhile, much of the country remained tense. Protests erupted in several cities, including the commercial capital Douala and Garoua, Tchiroma's hometown. Security forces used force to disperse crowds, leaving at least four people dead in recent days. Dozens of opposition figures and activists have been arrested.</p> <p>In Yaoundé, streets were quiet, shops shuttered, and armored vehicles patrolled major intersections. When approached, residents were too afraid to talk. In a country tightly controlled by the government, trust is scarce and fear is common.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Opposition disputes results</strong></h3> <p>Independent counts from several major polling stations had suggested Biya's challenger, 79-year-old Issa Tchiroma Bakary, was leading the count. A longtime government minister and Biya spokesperson, Tchiroma left the administration earlier this year and quickly gained traction among younger voters hungry for change — even from a figure long associated with the ruling elite.</p>
<p>He declared himself the winner two weeks ago, but the official results showed Biya prevailing even in regions where his support was thought weakest.</p> <p>A Catholic bishop who endorsed Tchiroma during the campaign described him as "a better devil," capturing the frustration of voters who see few genuine alternatives. Another prominent opposition figure, Maurice Kamto, was disqualified from the election in a decision he denounced as political interference, after a rival faction of his party presented a competing candidate.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>What comes next?</strong></h3> <p>On Monday, Tchiroma accused the government of plotting to arrest him and posted images on social media of snipers near his residence — claims that could not be independently verified. He called on supporters, including within the military, to "defend the true result." With recent coups across West and Central Africa, the risk of instability here looms large.</p> <p>Opposition leader Njang Dennis Tabeh said his party's figures indicate Biya was defeated.</p> <p>"The regime, as usual, even if they are defeated at the ballot box, controls all the institutions — from the electoral body to the constitutional council. The will of Cameroonians has to be imposed," he said.</p> <p>Biya's long absences and his government's tightening grip have fueled anger and uncertainty. Cameroon's crisis reflects a broader pattern across Africa: youthful populations ruled by aging leaders clinging to power through managed elections and weakened institutions.</p>

<div class="article-title">'Trapped and terrified': warnings as Sudanese militia advance on Darfur city</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — A paramilitary group accused of genocide says it has seized the last Sudanese army stronghold in the Darfur region. The move raises fears of ethnic cleansing and concerns the war-torn country could ultimately split in two.</p> <p>The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) said Sunday they had overrun the army's base in the city of El Fasher, which has been under siege for more than a year. The government — which has been fighting a civil war against the militia since 2023 — has yet to confirm this.</p> <p>The U.S., U.N. experts and the Sudanese army all argue that the RSF — which grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militia that fought in Darfur in the early 2000s — and allied ethnic-Arab militias have been committing genocide. They say the targets are African ethnic groups in Darfur.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>Monitoring for "evidence of potential mass atrocities"</strong></h3> <p>Videos circulating online that could not be independently verified by NPR appeared to show heavily armed RSF fighters celebrating taking the city; in vehicles chasing people fleeing; and shouting racial slurs at detainees.</p> <p>The United Nations' migration agency said 2,500 to 3,000 people had fled El Fasher since Sunday.  The Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale University confirmed satellite imagery showing significant damage at the city's airport and army headquarters.</p> <p>The Yale lab said it saw signs the RSF had taken prisoners and it was monitoring for "evidence of potential mass atrocities."</p> <p>The United Nations humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said in a statement that "with fighters pushing further into the city and escape routes cut off, hundreds of thousands of civilians are trapped and terrified — shelled, starving, and without access to food, healthcare, or safety."</p> <p>President Trump's Africa envoy Massad Boulos posted a statement saying, "Humanitarian corridors must be opened immediately… the world is watching El Fasher and the RSF's actions with deep concern."</p> <p>But Shayna Lewis, Sudan Specialist at the U.S.-based nonprofit Avaaz, said, "The international community has thus far failed in its responsibility to protect civilians, standing by whilst the RSF perpetrates a succession of ethnically-motivated massacres of civilians across Sudan."</p>
<p>"Thousands of civilians are at risk of atrocity crimes in and around El Fasher," she added.</p> <p>While rights groups have accused both sides in the conflict of war crimes, including extrajudicial killings and the blocking of humanitarian aid, they have blamed the vast majority of atrocities on the RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemeti.</p> <p>The Sudan Doctors Network said in a statement that dozens of people had been killed in a "horrific massacre…in a crime of ethnic cleansing" since the RSF took control of the El Fasher military base, a claim NPR could not independently verify.</p> <p>But the militia group has committed atrocities in the region this year already. In April, the RSF attacked the massive ZamZam displacement camp in North Darfur, which was home to about half a million people, killing hundreds.</p> <p>Doctors Without Borders said Monday it was treating people who had fled El Fasher at one of its nearby health posts: "During the night of 26 to 27 October, around 1,000 people from El Fasher arrived by truck… So far today, about 300 people were treated at the health post and 130 sent to the emergency room of the hospital, including 15 requiring lifesaving surgery."</p> <p>The majority of the children under five whom the aid group saw from the city were malnourished, the  group said.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>International involvement complicates conflict</strong></h3> <p>Two and a half years of conflict in Sudan have seen tens of thousands killed and 14 million displaced in what the United Nations says is the world's worst humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>The war over which side gets to run the resource-rich nation that sits at the vital crossroads between North Africa, the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea has not been happening in a vacuum.</p> <p>There are multiple international players involved.</p> <p>On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General António Gueterres lamented "external interference," which he said was undermining the possibility of a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iran are all supporting the Sudanese army, while the United Arab Emirates is accused of backing the RSF — something the UAE denies.</p> <p>The army, led by de-facto Sudanese leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, claimed a major victory earlier this year when it retook the capital Khartoum, marking a key turning point in the war.</p> <p>But the RSF regrouped in Darfur. It has besieged some 250,000 residents of El Fasher for 18 months, targeting civilians with drones and strikes, and the blockade has led to starvation and famine.</p> <p>With El Fasher now apparently in the hands of the RSF, the whole of Darfur is under the paramilitary's control. Experts worry the region could split the country in two, as happened during the last war in Darfur and the creation of South Sudan.</p> <p>The RSF announced the establishment of a rival government earlier this year, though it has not been recognized.</p>

<div class="article-title">Who is Doug Ford, the Canadian politician pushing Trump's buttons?</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>As Doug Ford campaigned to become Ontario's premier in 2018, he put out a very Trumpian vibe. On the trail, he attacked the media and the elites, raged against measures to combat climate change, vowed to cut income taxes and gas prices, and even expressed support for President Trump's policies.</p> <p>It might seem surprising then to now see Ford — who is in charge of Canada's largest province — taking the lead in opposing Trump's harsh tariffs as Prime Minister Mark Carney scrambles to manage the fallout from U.S.-Canada trade tensions.</p> <p>In recent months, Ford's criticism of Trump has been growing, most recently in the form of a television ad featuring the words of President Ronald Reagan warning in a 1987 radio address against the perils of protectionism. The ad has attracted Trump's ire and appears, at least temporarily, to have derailed trade talks between the two countries.</p>
<p>Who exactly is Doug Ford and what accounts for this political 180?</p> <p>Three generations of the former businessman's family have served as elected officials, and Ford began his political career on the Toronto City Council from 2010 to 2014.</p>
<p>The period was marked by the dramatic fall from grace of his younger brother, then-Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who admitted to smoking crack cocaine and then was dogged by evidence of a string of other abusive behavior. </p> <p>In the same year that Rob Ford publicly admitted to drug use, <em>The Globe and Mail</em> published an exposé that said the brothers had dealt hashish in the 1980s.</p> <p>Rob Ford died from a rare form of cancer in 2016.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Moving from the right to the center</h3> <p>Just two years after his brother's death, Doug Ford's political fortunes blossomed. He and his right-of-center Progressive Conservative Party won a majority in Ontario, riding discontent against the Liberal Party, who were coming off 15 years in power in the province.</p> <p>"Doug Ford got elected in large measure to get rid of a very unpopular government," says Steve Paikin, a long-time political analyst and host of the <em>Paikin Podcast</em>, a weekly current affairs podcast in Canada.</p> <p>Paikin says after Ford's success in 2018, he made the mistake of assuming Ontario had voted for his agenda, when in fact the Progressive Conservatives' election success was mostly about removing the Liberals.</p>
<p>"He got into office practicing a kind of disruptive, robust populism on steroids, which made his government, frankly, the most unpopular I had ever seen," Paikin says.</p> <p>That's when he decided to tack to the center. In the years that followed, Ford reached out to Canada's left, including the now-prime minister. He also won praise even from critics for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic response in Ontario.</p> <p>"COVID saved him. When the COVID crisis hit, he suddenly realized that all the kind of populist, anti-science, anti-expertise, 'we're just going to wing it by the seat of our pants,' that wasn't going to work," Paikin says. "He suddenly realized, I need to rely on experts."</p> <p>NPR reached out to Ford's office for an interview with the premier, but received no response.</p> <h3 class="edTag">From Trump enthusiast to "Captain Canada"</h3> <p>When former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he would step down in March this year, just as the White House was preparing its April 2 "Liberation Day" tariffs, Ford moved in to fill the vacuum, emerging as the voice of the anti-tariff response.</p>
<p>By the time of his second reelection bid earlier this year, Ford's early enthusiasm for Trump had long faded. On the campaign trail, he donned a baseball cap that mocked the red "Make America Great Again" hats — Ford's blue cap, worn at a news conference in January, read "Canada is not for sale."</p> <p>"President Trump is promising steep and sweeping tariffs that will devastate our economy and put hundreds of thousands of people out of work," Ford told voters. "Whether he imposes tariffs next week, next month or waits a year, President Trump's threats are not going away. With a strong mandate from the people, I will do whatever it takes to protect Ontario."</p> <p>After winning reelection in February, Ford threatened to cut off electricity to homes in the U.S. in retaliation for the tariffs and Trump's threats to annex Canada. Ford also canceled a $100 million contract with Elon Musk's SpaceX to provide Starlink services to the country.</p>
<p>Ford's stance won him the sobriquet "Captain Canada."</p> <h3 class="edTag">"Bad cop" to Carney's "good cop"</h3> <p>Trump announced Friday that he was ending all trade negotiations with Canada over the ad featuring Reagan. Ford subsequently said that after talking with Carney, he had decided to pause the advertising campaign, calling it a success for having reached U.S. audiences.</p> <p>In an X post on Friday, Ford wrote: "Canada and the United States are friends, neighbours and allies." In a statement later, he said: "Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses."</p> <p>"We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels," he added.</p> <p>Paikin suggests that because of their close relationship, Carney and Ford are playing a game of "good cop, bad cop" with the anti-tariff ads – Ford gets to ramp up the rhetoric as Carney plays deal maker.</p> <p>"Mark Carney ran on a platform of elbows up and ever since he became the prime minister, the elbows have definitely been down," Paikin says. "He's trying to take a more muted approach."</p> <p>"The other side of the coin is [that] Doug Ford is free to do whatever he wants."</p>

<div class="article-title">Ireland's president-elect is a left-wing, anti-establishment figure who is outspoken on Gaza</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>LONDON — Ireland's president for the next seven years is an independent lawmaker who has long spoken in support of Palestinians and has been vocal about her distrust of European Union policies.</p> <p>Left-wing independent Catherine Connolly, 68, secured 63% of votes in a landslide election victory on Saturday, comfortably defeating her center-right rival, former Cabinet minister Heather Humphreys.</p> <p>The politician won after Ireland's left-leaning opposition parties, including Sinn Féin, united to back her, and she is expected to be a voice unafraid to challenge Ireland's center-right government.</p>
<p>While Irish presidents hold a largely ceremonial role and do not have executive powers like shaping laws, they represent Ireland on the world stage and are often seen as a unifying voice on major issues. Connolly will succeed Michael D. Higgins, a popular president who has been vocal about the war in Gaza and NATO spending, among other things.</p> <p>Connolly vowed Saturday to be "an inclusive president" who would champion diversity and be "a voice for peace."</p> <p>A look at Connolly's background and views:</p> <h3 class="edTag">From independent lawmaker to president</h3> <p>Connolly, a mother to two sons, has served three terms as an independent lawmaker for Galway West since she was elected to Parliament in 2016. In 2020, she became the first woman to be the deputy speaker of Parliament's lower house.</p>
<p>She grew up in social housing in a suburb of Galway in western Ireland as one of 14 children. Her mother died when she was nine years old, and her father worked at a local shipyard. As a student, she volunteered with a Catholic organization to help older people and took on other community roles.</p> <p>She has degrees in clinical psychology and law, and was a lawyer before she entered politics.</p> <p>Connolly began her political career when she was elected as a Labour Party member of Galway City Council in 1999. Five years later, she was elected mayor of the city of Galway. She left Labour in 2007.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>Outspoken views against Israel and the EU</strong></h3> <p>Connolly has not shied from criticizing Israel over the war in Gaza.</p> <p>In September, she drew fire for calling Hamas "part of the fabric of the Palestinian people." Prime Minister Micheál Martin criticized her for appearing reluctant to condemn the militant group's actions in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that ignited the two-year Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>
<p>She later maintained that she "utterly condemned" Hamas' actions, while also criticizing Israel for carrying out what she called a genocide in Gaza.</p> <p>On Europe, she has repeatedly criticized the European Union for its growing "militarization" following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, drawn comparisons with Nazi-era armament in the 1930s, and questioned NATO expansion in the east. Critics have said those comments, along with others critical of the U.S. and U.K., risk alienating Ireland's allies.</p> <p>Connolly has also stressed she wants to defend Ireland's tradition of military neutrality, in the face of calls for the country to contribute more to European defense. During her campaign, she said there should be a referendum on a government plan to remove the "triple lock" — the conditions for the deployment of Irish soldiers on international missions.</p> <p>Connolly's outspoken style and message of social equality and inclusivity have appealed to many, especially younger voters. In televised presidential debates, she has said she will respect the limits of the office — though she also said in her acceptance speech that she would speak "when it's necessary" as president.</p> <p>"Together, we can shape a new republic that values everybody, that values and champions diversity and that takes confidence in our own identity, our Irish language, our English language, and new people who have come to our country," she said Saturday at Dublin Castle.</p>

<div class="article-title">Finland's stubbornly low birth rate shows why a population shift may be inevitable</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p><em>Families in the U.S. and around the world are having fewer children as people make profoundly different decisions about their lives. NPR's series </em><em>Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World </em><em>explores the causes and implications of this trend.</em></p> <p>On a clear but chilly autumn day, Poa Pohjola and her partner Wilhelm Blomberg are relaxing in their Helsinki apartment while their baby naps outside on the balcony, in traditional Finnish style.</p> <p>"They sleep very well outside, in colder degrees, I think," Pohjola said with a laugh. "Or, that's how I grew up thinking."</p>
<p>Pohjola is 38 and Blomberg is 35. They've been together for about three years, and they started talking about having a baby early on - even though Pohjola had once thought she might never have kids.</p> <p>"I think I was denying that for myself because it seemed [like] something that would be impossible to have," she said.</p>
<p>In her 20s, Pohjola says she struggled to figure out what she wanted from life. By the time she met Blomberg, she knew the window of opportunity to become pregnant was closing because of her age.</p> <p>But one night, the couple talked about their wishes for their future, and she told Blomberg she thought she wanted a baby. He agreed.</p> <p>Blomberg says they both felt ready to be parents.</p> <p>"One, in a way, convincing argument was that both of us have had time to, like, roam around and do what we want in life," he explained.</p> <p>Researchers say Finnish people are increasingly delaying having children, or not having them at all. The nation's "total fertility rate" — a technical term used by demographers — has fallen to historic lows in recent years. Although there have been some signs of a possible rebound in recent months, the number remains less than 1.3 children per woman — well below the replacement level of 2.1 needed to maintain a steady population.</p>
<p>That's despite the Nordic region's reputation for providing paid time off for both mothers and fathers, along with childcare and other support. As families around the world are having fewer children, even Europe is seeing a major drop in birth rates despite those generous, publicly funded benefits.</p> <p>Among other things, that means less demand for Finland's iconic baby boxes.</p>
<p>"It has loads of winter clothes, loads of summer clothes, loads of baby care items, something for moms," said Eeva Patomeri, a spokesperson for Kela, Finland's taxpayer-funded social insurance agency.</p> <p>They've been handing out the boxes since the 1930s and there's a new edition of the box each year. But many new parents were still getting last year's box well into 2025 because Kela still had so many left over from 2024.</p> <p>"Sometimes the box, we start delivering it in spring, and now it was August, and that's because of low birth rates," Patomeri said, adding more parents are choosing cash payments in lieu of the box, too.</p>
<p>Benefits for Finnish parents go far beyond free baby clothes and blankets. Both mothers and fathers receive government-subsidized parental leave through Kela, low-cost childcare and national healthcare.</p> <p>Kela's research manager, Anneli Miettinen, says historically, leaders of the Nordic countries: Finland, along with Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, thought these policies were helping to support relatively stable birth rates.</p> <p>"So we cannot really any longer say that it's our good family policies that explain good fertility in the Nordics," she said.</p>
<p>Births have fallen across the region, with Finland's falling to the lowest rate among the five nations — down by a third since 2010.</p> <p>"What is puzzling researchers, is how this could be true, because all of these countries are relatively good in providing support to families," Miettinen said, "but there aren't really very good explanations for the very low fertility rates at present."</p>
<p>Immigration has offset some of the decline, but officials in Finland, like many other countries facing this global trend, are still worried about an aging population, a shrinking workforce and pressure on the pension system.</p> <p>Anna Rotkirch, with the nonprofit Family Federation of Finland authored a report last year commissioned by the Finnish government, which outlined possible causes and policy solutions. Rotkirch says her research suggests a gap between what young people say they want from life and the families they ultimately form.</p> <p>"We go to schools; you talk to 17-year-olds, and we are like, 'What would be your ideal family? If you want a family at all, what would be your ideal life?'" she explained.<strong> </strong></p> <p>"You get these, surprisingly, in a way, normative perceptions," she added. "You know, 'I want a small house with a dog and a garden and a spouse and three children.'" </p> <p>"And it really breaks my heart, because I'm like, that's not going to happen. If the world goes on like it's now, you know, half of you, this is just not going to happen," she said. </p>
<h3 class="edTag">Disconnected and financially uncertain amid family planning</h3> <p>Rotkirch says there appear to be many possible reasons for this decline. Many young people are focusing on their education and careers. Those who have children are having them later. Rotkirch says young people also are having a harder time forming relationships, and some researchers think technology is partly to blame.</p> <p>"Screens are away from actual physical, embodied interactions, and it's in those interactions that babies get made and also people fall in love," she explained. "The physical part of our humanity is obviously at stake."</p> <p>Milla Tuokkola, a 34-year-old television writer in Helsinki, says she's tried dating online. But too often, she says, she's been harassed and subjected to degrading language.</p> <p>"They're just very porn-brained…objectifying," she said of the men she's meeting online and on dating apps. "I feel like they're being radicalized online when they're young."</p> <p>Tuokkola is divorced. Sometimes, she thinks she'd like to have a child, but she's had trouble meeting the right partner.</p> <p>"They don't seem a safe, reliable option to have a child with," she said.</p>
<p>Some young adults say when they think about having children, they also worry about the larger state of the world, whether climate change or the economy.</p> <p>Anselmi Auramo, 28, is a student in Helsinki. He's engaged to be married, and plans to become a father one day, but says he's not sure when he'll be financially ready. He believes financial concerns cause many young people to think twice about having children. </p> <p>"Whether it's [the] American dream or Finnish dream or whatever it is, it seems so distant, and you expect to have that in order to have the family," he said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Answering a global question</h3> <p>Finland's struggle to boost family size matches what many other countries are experiencing. From authoritarian regimes like China and Russia to progressive nations like Canada and Finland, governments have tried a range of policies designed to encourage higher birth rates.</p>
<p>But experts say even the most expensive attempts at policy solutions have shown limited or no success.</p> <p>Miettinen, with Kela, says there's not one, single reason why young people are having fewer children, and there won't be a single solution to reversing the trend, either.</p> <p>"These types of policies may not be enough any longer, but we need to invent something else to support young adults," she said.</p>
<p>Rotkirch, with the Family Federation, says ultimately, these decisions are in the hands of younger generations.</p> <p>"But what we can do as the elderly generations and what the policy makers can do is really prioritize this," Rotkirch said. "Prioritize listening to young people - their wishes for family formation - and support them."</p> <p>For Poa Pohjola and Wilhelm Blomberg, the couple with the new baby, there are fears about the future. Pohjola remembers Finland's financial crisis in the early 1990s, and worries about economic stability.</p> <p>Blomberg says he thinks about climate change and rising authoritarianism around the world.</p> <p>"We are in such turbulent times, and it's hard to, like, have a sense that you can control things," he said. "And one thing you can control is whether you're having a baby or not, as it's so hard to predict what the future will bring."</p> <p>Still, they're talking about having another child; Blomberg has a brother he's very close to, and he'd like to give their son a sibling, too.</p> <p>Pohjola is slightly more hesitant.</p> <p>"When I start overthinking it, I'm like, 'Okay, we would need to have this child quite soonish, and then we have a toddler and a baby," she said. "And okay, we won't be sleeping, so it's gonna be a lot of work."</p> <p>But, now that she's had one baby, she said, she's inclined to have another.</p> <p><em>NPR's </em><em>Brian Mann</em><em> contributed to this story. </em></p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>

<p>The clowns come at you quickly at Fast Splash Car Wash in Detroit, Mich. They tap on the windows of waiting vehicles, jiggle locked doors and cackle at the dozens of automobiles in line for scares served with suds, sprayers and sponges. Chamois, meet chainsaws.</p> <p>If as a child you cowered in the back seat during trips through the local car wash, terrified of giant rotating brushes and mitter curtains slapping against the family car, a haunted car wash will trigger those ancient memories. Take the roaring machinery and darkness, add a strobe light and a guy in a hockey mask, and you've got a primal fear package perfect for vehicular adults with a taste for Halloween thrills.</p>
<p>"This is going to be the biggest year we have for this," says Joel Fullmer, a retail marketing manager at Tommy's Express, a car wash chain based in Holland, Mich., with 260 locations across the country. Nearly half of them, from Alaska to Wyoming, will be running a Halloween-themed, trademarked "Tunnel of Terror."</p> <p>The trend has grown across the country for years at independent and chain car washes. A grinning skeleton in a trucker hat might clean your car at the Wiggy Wash in Orem, Utah, or a team of demonic clowns might do the job at the Whatta Wash Car Wash in Greer, S.C. The origins of the haunted car wash trend are murky. The phenomenon is especially widespread in car-obsessed Southern California but Fullmer says he first heard about haunted car washes in Virginia and Florida.</p>
<p>"Our car wash is known for being bright and open, not the claustrophobic brick tunnel feeling," Fullmer says. "But for this event, we black out the windows, we turn down the lights, we run fog machines. Our team members will dress up in costumes. We'll have them walking around our pay lanes as cars drive up for the event, staring in windows, pulling on door handles, seeing people jump from one side of the car to the other."</p>
<p>Fullmer himself has worked the line, disguised as a ghoul. "Yeah, it's a fun experience," he says. Some Tommy's locations, he adds, double their business the week before Halloween. One location washed over a thousand cars in eight hours. Many haunted car washes across the country charge $25 to $30 for the experience.</p> <p>"Unfortunately, we haven't directly analyzed 'haunted' washes,'" says James Risley, research manager of the International Carwash Association. In an email, he noted that industry surveys found that creating a "memorable or differentiated wash experience is 'very important' to 85% of car wash businesses" and "Halloween transformations can keep a car wash location top-of-mind for the community." Not to mention scaring up plenty of customers.</p>
