<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A suspect in Hamas' October 2023 terror attack against Israel that sparked a two-year war between the two sides has been formally charged in federal court.</p><p>Mahmoud Amin Ya’qub al-Muhtadi, who has been living in Louisiana, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Lafayette for conspiring to support a foreign terrorist organization and visa fraud, according to KADN.</p><p>He faces up to life in prison in the U.S. if convicted.</p><p>Al-Muhtadi pleaded not guilty to the charges, KADN reported.</p><p>The indictment links Al-Muhtadi to Hamas' attack, which killed roughly 1,200 people. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were also killed in Israel's military retaliation.</p><p>Authorities claim Al-Muhtadi trained with a Hamas military group before entering the U.S. on a fake visa. He was working at a restaurant until his arrest last week.</p><p>U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said Al-Muhtadi should face the legal consequences if he is convicted.</p><p>"Clearly, he's a war criminal there. But I think there's multiple ways to pursue this, and I think that if he is guilty, he should have the full consequences of his actions," Cassidy said in a statement to KADN.</p><p>Al-Muhtadi will remain in custody without bond until his trial.

<div class="article-title">Government shutdown knowledge: gaming out its potential end</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p><i>"I know that I know nothing" – Socrates</i></p><p><i>"You don’t know nothing" – Baseball Legend Yogi Berra</i></p><p>Socrates may have been claiming ignorance, Berra was talking about baseball, but both may as well have been talking about the government shutdown.</p><p>So when will it end?</p><p>"You shouldn't ask me because I'm the guy who said it'll only last five days," Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., said on Fox. "But I will tell you, a couple of Democrat senators recently indicated that they think this is going to go ‘til at least the first of November."</p><p>However, Biggs added that he doesn’t "see an end in sight."</p><p>Whether you are Socrates or Yogi Berra, we don’t know "nothing." Which technically means that we <i>do</i> know something.</p><p>However, I do know proper grammar.</p><p>The one thing that I do know in this case is that I don’t know anything about ending the government shutdown.</p><p>Regardless… Is it even possible to game out when the government shutdown may end?</p><p>Congressional Republicans believed that Democrats would fold after a matter of days once funding lapsed in the wee hours of Oct. 1. Then Republicans argued that Democrats would cry "uncle" once federal workers missed their first paycheck last week. Later, the GOP suggested Democrats would keep the government shuttered through the "No Kings" rallies around the country last weekend.</p><p>The GOP argued that Democrats needed to show their base that they were "fighting" against President Donald Trump.</p><p>"Now that they had their protests, I just pray that they come to their senses and re-open the government this week," said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.</p><p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., accused Republicans of continually changing their reasons for why Democrats are blocking the GOP bill to fund the government.</p><p>"In a few days, it will be about something else," Jeffries said.</p><p>So, we enter the ice age of Congressional inactivity as the government shutdown enters its fourth week.</p><p>Who could have predicted it?</p><p>Then again, who could have predicted thieves could make off with millions of dollars of jewelry inside the Louvre in an historic heist? At least the bandits stole our attention away from the government shutdown for a bit.</p><p>That said, everyone knows (even if they won’t say it publicly) who will likely end the government shutdown: Trump.</p><p>He’s not just the president. Trump has a sway over Republicans in Congress that Ronald Reagan could only envy. So until he joins the fray, the government will remain closed.</p><p>"Donald Trump definitively needs to get involved. He needs to get off the sidelines. Get off the golf course and actually decide to end the shutdown that he's created and that he has allowed to happen," Jeffries said.</p><p>"Donald Trump, instead of leaving the country before he leaves the country, should sit down and negotiate with us so we can address this horrible crisis," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. "The president should meet with us. It's not me, him or anything political. It's that the people are in crisis every day."</p><p>The president did meet with lawmakers this week, holding court with Senate Republicans for lunch in the renovated Rose Garden.</p><p>"Did you notice the white marble floor?" quipped the president.</p><p>But Democrats contend that Trump huddled with the wrong party. Schumer characterized it as "a Rose Garden pep rally."</p><p>Trump implored Democrats to bend – and vote for the GOP spending bill.</p><p>"They're getting killed in the polls," he said.</p><p>"Shouldn’t the president get involved in negotiations at this stage to end this?" yours truly asked Johnson.</p><p>"We're not going [to] pay a ransom to reopen the federal government," replied the speaker.</p><p>"Isn’t the only key to end this shutdown to just have a sit-down negotiation with both sides?" I countered.</p><p>"Republicans have nothing to offer to Democrats," replied Johnson.</p><p>In fact, some Republicans argued that Trump shouldn’t even negotiate.</p><p>"If I've learned anything about President Trump, it's his timing. I think that he feels like the timing is not right now. We're winning the messaging war," said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan. "So there'll be a time. But the time is not ripe yet."</p><p>It’s unclear when that time may come, considering that the government has remained shuttered for more than three weeks.</p><p>And two weeks ago, Republicans torched Schumer for declaring things got "better" for Democrats the longer the shutdown dragged on, but shutdown fatigue is now setting in on Capitol Hill.</p><p>"Welcome to day 22 of the Democrats’ shutdown," Johnson declared at the now sonorous daily press briefings delivered by both sides.</p><p>"This does suck," said Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., on Fox Business about the shutdown.</p><p>Lawmakers are now seeking shutdown daylight.</p><p>"The hope is that we get this shutdown resolved before the end of the month," Jeffries said.</p><p>There’s worry about how the shutdown might impact national parks.</p><p>"(Here are) the more negative consequences that we'll start to see without regular staffing. Litter will pile up and park ecosystems will be affected," said House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark.</p><p>Both parties are convinced they’re prevailing in the shutdown.</p><p>"What I did hear on our telephone town hall repeatedly (is) ‘Don't you guys give into these hostage takers,’" said Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho. "I heard that repeatedly."</p><p>"It’s resonating with Americans. What I'm hearing from people in Connecticut is ‘hang tough,’" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.</p><p>The Senate holds a test vote Thursday on a bill to pay essential workers who are on the job without a paycheck, but Democrats are skeptical.</p><p>"I'd be in favor of paying the federal workers," said Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt. "That bill, unfortunately, gives a lot of latitude to the president to pick and choose, or, I should say, (White House Budget Director) Russell Vought to pick and choose (who gets paid)."</p><p>So while shutdown weariness sets in, no one knows when it might end.</p><p>It is said that knowing what you don’t know actually constitutes true knowledge.</p><p>And if no one knows the end of the shutdown, that must mean that everyone is pretty smart.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Former New York state trooper sentenced to 6 months in prison after faking his own shooting: 'disgraceful'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A former New York state trooper was sentenced on Wednesday to six months behind bars after he shot himself in the leg and falsely claimed that he was wounded by an unknown gunman.</p><p>Thomas Mascia pleaded guilty in May to falsely reporting an incident, tampering with physical evidence and official misconduct. Mascia, who had been a trooper since 2019, resigned in January after he was suspended without pay while state police conducted a criminal investigation into the shooting.</p><p>In addition to prison time, Mascia was given five years of probation and ordered to undergo mental health treatment and pay nearly $290,000 in restitution in Nassau County court in Mineola.</p><p>Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly criticized Mascia for his "disgraceful" actions that wasted police resources, including a manhunt that lasted several days.</p><p>"His lies wasted hundreds of hours of law enforcement manpower, deeply cost taxpayers in Nassau County, and betrayed the public’s trust of those in uniform," Donnelly said in a statement after the sentencing.</p><p>Mascia reported that he was shot in the leg on Oct. 30, 2024, by a driver parked on the shoulder of the Southern State Parkway on Long Island, about a mile from the trooper's home. He described the fictitious driver as a "dark-skinned" man who drove away in a black sedan with temporary New Jersey plates heading toward New York City.</p><p>He had shot himself at Hempstead Lake State Park before stashing the .22-caliber rifle and driving to the highway to call for help.</p><p>Prosecutors said Mascia also planted shell casings at the scene where he shot himself.</p><p>There was no video footage of the incident because Mascia's body camera was not activated at the time.</p><p>Mascia is "mortified by his actions and happy to finally get on with his life," lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman, who represents the former trooper and his parents, said in a statement to The Associated Press.</p><p>Prosecutors said Mascia shot himself in an apparent attempt to receive attention and sympathy.</p><p>Lichtman previously said Mascia was suffering from an undiagnosed mental health problem at the time of the shooting and that the former trooper has been undergoing treatment.</p><p>"There are many less severe and less dangerous ways to garner sympathy that don’t include shooting oneself," he said in January. "And now an entire family is suffering for it as they usually do in such situations."</p><p>Mascia's parents, Dorothy and Thomas, were also each charged with criminal possession of a firearm after the gun used in the shooting was found in their West Hempstead bedroom during a search of the home.</p><p>The disgraced trooper's father was sentenced to five years of probation on Wednesday while his mother was given a one-year conditional discharge.</p><p>Mascia's father was dismissed from the New York Police Department in 1993 after pleading guilty to cocaine distribution charges.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Sparks fly as Cuomo, Mamdani tear into each other during fiery debate: 'Toxic energy'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Front-runners for New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo, wasted little time attacking each other on alleged personal scandals they have been involved in during a Wednesday night debate between the pair and GOP candidate Curtis Sliwa.  </p><p>Mamdani and Sliwa took the opportunity during Wednesday's debate to drill down on past sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo, the former governor of New York, ahead of an impeachment inquiry that preceded Cuomo's 2021 resignation. Cuomo was also hit by Mamdani over accusations he has – while in public office – failed to meet with Muslim constituents and only began doing so amid pressure from his mayoral campaign, and over his alleged poor handling of the COVID-19 virus in New York after Cuomo was party to issuing guidance forcing nursing homes and long-term care facilities to admit COVID-19 positive patients.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cuomo did not hold back on targeting Mamdani over alleged controversies that have embattled his campaign. Cuomo blasted the self-proclaimed socialist over his lack of experience, ties to radical politics, and past radical comments about law enforcement, Israel and the situation in Gaza.</p><p>"My main opponent has no new ideas. He has no new plan. … He's never run anything, managed anything. He's never had a real job," Cuomo said of Mamdani during the debate. Cuomo also branded Mamdani as someone who has proven to be "a divisive force in New York," pointing to past incidents that have garnered Mamdani heat from critics. </p><p>One of those incidents included a picture he took with a hard-lined Ugandan lawmaker who has pushed policies of imprisoning people for being gay, which Mamdani took while taking a break from the campaign trail to visit his home country of Uganda for a wedding. Cuomo also hit the controversy over whether Mamdani supports Jewish New Yorkers, as his critics have claimed he is anti-Israel pointing to statements he has made, like "globalize the intifada." </p><p>Cuomo also accused Mamdani of disrespecting Italian-Americans after a video of him surfaced giving the middle finger to a statue of Christopher Columbus, while also pointing to criticism the self-proclaimed socialist candidate has garnered from 9/11 first-responders after posting a photo with a Muslim cleric who served as a character witness for the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001 attacks. </p><p>"You have been a divisive force in New York, and I believe that's toxic energy for New York. It's with the Jewish community. It's with the Italian-American community – when you give the Columbus statue the finger. It's with the Sunni Muslims when you say decriminalize prostitution, which is Haram. It's the Hindus," Cuomo continued. "Then, you take a picture with Rebecca Kadaga, deputy Prime Minister of Uganda. … She's known as Rebecca ‘Gay Killer.’ … You're a citizen of Uganda. You took the picture. You said you didn't know who she was. It turns out you did. How do you not renounce your citizenship or demand BDS against Uganda for imprisoning people who are gay just by their sexual orientation? Isn't that a basic violation of human rights?"</p><p>Mamdani shot back that his politics have remained "consistent" and that they are built on a belief in human rights for all people, including LGBTQ+ folks. Had he known Kadga's role in drafting legislation to imprison gay folks, Mamdani said, he never would have taken the picture. </p><p>"This constant attempt to smear and slander me is an attempt to also distract from the fact that, unlike myself, you do not actually have a platform or a set of policies," Mamdani shot back at Cuomo before introducing his own claims about the former governor regarding past accusations of sexual harassment.</p><p>"Mr. Cuomo. In 2021, 13 different women who worked in your administration credibly accused you of sexual harassment. Since then, you have spent more than $20 million in taxpayer funds to defend yourself, all while describing these allegations as entirely political," Mamdani said while attacking Cuomo Wednesday night. </p><p>"You have even gone so far as to legally go after these women. One of those women, Charlotte Bennett, is here in the audience this evening. You sought to access her private gynecological records. She cannot speak up for herself because you lodged a defamation case against her. I, however, can speak. What do you say to the 13 women that you sexually harassed?" </p><p>Cuomo, in 2021, was accused of multiple incidents of sexual harassment that preceded his resignation as governor that year. A subsequent report from New York Attorney General Letitia James confirmed Cuomo "sexually harassed multiple women from 2013 through 2020," while in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it had reached a nearly $500,000 settlement with Cuomo's executive office over one of the claims. However, no criminal charges were ever filed against Cuomo, with some district attorneys citing insufficient evidence.</p><p>Cuomo defended himself against Mamdani's accusations, noting the cases were eventually dropped, before returning to questions about Mamdani's alleged past. </p><p>Meanwhile, Sliwa didn't skip an opportunity to slam Cuomo over the sexual assault allegations either, saying early in the debate during a discussion about homelessness that Cuomo "fled" the governor's office amid an impeachment inquiry that was investigating him.</p><p>"Andrew, you didn't ‘leave.’ You fled from being impeached by the Democrats in the state legislature," Sliwa began before getting into the homelessness issue, earning him a round-of-applause from the audience. </p><p>"'Leave?' You fled!" Sliwa continued to applause. "But let's get back on topic." </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Aaron Rodgers tells 311-pound Steelers teammate to stop tackling him after touchdowns: 'I'm 41'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Aaron Rodgers went viral last Thursday with some crafty touchdown passes for the Pittsburgh Steelers, but the biggest clip that circulated was after a crucial one in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Rodgers was celebrating a 68-yard catch-and-run for six by tight end Pat Freiermuth that gave Pittsburgh a late lead against the Cincinnati Bengals, but when offensive tackle Broderick Jones tried to join Rodgers, the moment went awry. Jones jumped on top of Rodgers, and both of them fell to the turf. </p><p>Rodgers was heated, and he gave a straight answer as to why on Wednesday. </p><p>"What you don’t see in the video is right after the throw, he’s coming over to me and shaking me and shaking me," Rodgers said about Jones. "I texted him, I said, ‘Hey, I love your energy, I love everything you’re about. But also, I’m 41. You can’t be out there tackling me.’"</p><p>Fair enough, Aaron.</p><p>The celebration didn’t last long for the Steelers, though, as Joe Flacco had his coming-out party in his first Bengals home game since being traded by the Cleveland Browns. </p><p>Flacco finished his great night with a game-winning drive to beat their AFC North rival, 33-31. </p><p>Rodgers threw for 249 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions in the loss. And Jones did deserve to celebrate given Rodgers wasn’t sacked once despite the loss. </p><p>While Rodgers doesn’t want Jones to tackle him again, the 6-foot-5, 311-pound tackle didn’t rule out it never happening again. </p><p>"It’s just the energy that he brings and that I bring," he told reporters on Tuesday. "He told me, ‘Don’t lose the fire,’ and I told him the same. We shall see on Sunday after he throws another touchdown. I might tackle him again."</p><p>It’ll be a special Sunday for Rodgers, who will face his former Green Bay Packers squad for the first time since he departed for the New York Jets two seasons ago. Rodgers obviously has storied history with the franchise that took him 24th overall in the 2005 NFL Draft. </p><p>He commented on facing the Packers, saying he doesn’t "have any animosity toward the organization."</p><p>"I wish that things had been better in our last year there, but I have a great relationship with a lot of people still in that organization, and this is not a revenge game for me," he told ESPN. "I’m just excited to see some of those guys and be on ‘Sunday Night Football’ again."</p><p>With the prime time lights shining down on Acrisure Stadium on Sunday night, Rodgers may not consider this a revenge game, but he sure hopes to score a lot of touchdowns against his former team. </p><p>He’s just hoping to stay upright after throwing them. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Fetterman breaks with Democrats over shutdown, vows to put 'country over party'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., told "Hannity" Wednesday he’s willing to "pay a price" to help reopen the government, even if it means breaking with his party, as the shutdown stretches into its fourth week.</p><p>"I am always going to vote country over my party and if I pay a price within my base, that's something I am willing to do," Fetterman said.</p><p>Fetterman has been outspoken in his criticism of the shutdown, vocalizing his priorities to fund the military and Capitol Police over party politics. He noted that he's one of only two Democrats voting to keep the government open.</p><p>"I'm not afraid to tell my truth and if I'm going to pay a penalty, I'm not afraid of that," Fetterman told host Sean Hannity. "It's wrong to shut our government down."</p><p>This comes after Fetterman labeled the 22-day-long shutdown a "failure" in a post to X Wednesday.</p><p>Looming cuts to critical government programs have struck a chord with the Pennsylvania Democrat.</p><p>"I refuse to vote to suspend SNAP for millions of Pennsylvanians in my state and across the entire nation," he insisted.</p><p>Millions of Pennsylvanians and 42 million Americans rely on food bought with assistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps low-income families afford nutritious groceries. The largely federally funded program is reportedly expected to be cut if the shutdown continues.</p><p>"That’s going to be suspended because our government is shut down," Fetterman said. "I can't ever vote for that kind of mass food insecurity."</p><p>The Democratic senator also condemned what he described as "extreme" rhetoric from party leaders, referencing President Donald Trump being labeled a "fascist."</p><p>"Extreme kinds of rhetoric make it easier for those extreme kinds of actions," he said.</p><p>"I refuse to be a part of it and comparing people to Hitler and those things," he added. "If that's what's required to win, then I refuse to."</p><p>Fetterman cautioned that inflammatory language is steering the country in the wrong direction, saying, "We’ve lost the plot."</p><p>"I refuse to call my fellow citizens fascists or Nazis or those things," Fetterman said. "If somebody wants to primary me or the party wants to vote me out, I'm going to go down being honest and telling you that this is wrong."</p><p>Fetterman urged both parties to return to decency and cooperation, saying he’s willing to take political heat if it means standing up for his convictions.</p><p>"It's just basic humanity and we're forgetting that we all need each other," he concluded.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte endorses Trump's approach to ending Ukraine war after White House talks</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told Fox News his Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump on Wednesday reaffirmed that he believes the Trump administration is pursuing the right approach in its attempt to end the war in Ukraine, despite the recent cancellation of a planned Trump-Putin meeting. </p><p>The meeting came days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the White House and was focused on ways to build on momentum following the peace agreement in the Middle East. </p><p>"We are able, collectively, to change the calculus of Vladimir Putin," Rutte told "Special Report," citing how recent secondary sanctions on India and the suggestion of sending long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine prompted the Russian leader to pick up the phone. </p><p>Rutte also mentioned stagnant Russian gains and heavy losses as a driving force to finally bring the war, which has lasted over three years, to an end. </p><p>Rutte expressed optimism over the Trump administration’s approach due to the economic hardship he said the war has triggered within Russia, citing long lines of cars waiting for gas from a depleted supply heavily targeted by Ukrainian attacks and strapped with sanctions. </p><p>The U.S. Treasury Department hit Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia’s two largest oil companies, with sanctions after Russian drone and missile attacks killed at least six people across Ukraine.</p><p>Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier pushed back on Rutte for his optimism, saying that in the past, attacks have increased in Ukraine after attempted communication with Putin. Following August’s Alaska summit, Russia launched a massive drone and missile attack across Ukraine.</p><p>"What do you say to critics who say that these communications with Putin let him off the hook?" Baier asked. </p><p>"We always knew this was not easy…" Rutte said. </p><p>"This will not end tomorrow or the day after tomorrow," he added. </p><p>He pointed to Trump’s close collaboration with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on preventing Russian oil sales as another positive step, as well as NATO’s unity in deterring possible threats.</p><p>In the past six weeks, three Russian planes flew over Estonian airspace and drones have crossed into Poland. Both are NATO countries. </p><p>"NATO reacted exactly as we should," Rutte said. "We have trained and prepared for this."</p><p>The secretary-general also made it clear that, in the future, if Russian planes pose a threat, NATO can take them down if necessary. If they don’t pose a threat, they will be intercepted and guided out of NATO airspace. </p><p>Rutte emphasized his faith that Trump would stand by his promise to bring the killing to an end. </p><p>"He is really a peacemaker," Rutte said. "He wants to end this war. This is close to his heart." </p><p>He als emphasized the importance of freezing the lines of the conflict immediately, and having Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin come to the table for a meeting. </p><p>"Stop where you are, and then you can still debate a lot of other things later," Rutte said.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa cites height as one reason for Jaylen Waddle's lack of targets in latest loss</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>There are a lot of questions that need answering for the 1-6 Miami Dolphins, but one of them was why Jaylen Waddle, the Dolphins’ top receiver without Tyreek Hill on the field for the remainder of the season, didn’t see much action in Sunday’s blowout loss to the Cleveland Browns. </p><p>Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has an answer, and it’s likely Dolphins fans don’t want to hear it. </p><p>"I think with that, some of it has to do with being able to see guys, with their guys also up front and our guys," Tagovailoa told reporters Tuesday. </p><p>"I’m not the tallest guy in the back there either. So, being able to see, and then sometimes when that happens, you don’t want to just throw it blindly, and you gotta progress. So, I think that has some merit to reasons as to why that happened for Waddle."</p><p>It's no secret Tagovailoa, listed at 6-foot-1, isn’t the tallest quarterback in the NFL. But it’s another thing to admit he isn’t able to see his receivers during plays. </p><p>It may be true, but obviously having sight of your offensive weapons is key for any quarterback. Nonetheless, Tagovailoa targeted Waddle, who stands at 5-foot-10, just four times in the 31-6 beatdown on the road. He caught just one pass for 15 yards. </p><p>Waddle hasn’t had this few targets or catches in a single game since Week 14 against the Houston Texans last season. In that game, Waddle didn’t have one catch and was only targeted twice, though he suffered a knee injury. </p><p>But Tagovailoa was struggling all day for the Dolphins, and the Browns’ defense intercepted three passes and limited Tagovailoa to 12 completed passes for 100 yards in the loss. </p><p>Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel had Tagovailoa working with his teammates like a well-oiled machine, but this season has proved hard to get that same timing on each week. </p><p>McDaniel noted on Tuesday that he and Tagovailoa had an hour-and-a-half meeting the day prior, which he called "great."</p><p>"I think there’s zero uncertainty with Tua on my conviction in him and my belief in him," McDaniel told reporters. "We’re both very eager to do better at our jobs, and we’re both very committed and trusting of each other to respond to what is necessary for the team to do better."</p><p>The 27-year-old quarterback leads the NFL in interceptions this season with 10 compared to 11 touchdown passes. He has thrown for 1,313 yards with a 67.8% completion rate. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that the U.S. military has carried out another strike in the Eastern Pacific targeting alleged terrorists he says were engaged in narco-trafficking.</p><p>Three suspected narco-terrorists were killed, according to Hegseth. The strikes were ordered at the direction of President Donald Trump. </p><p>Hegseth said the Pentagon conducted "yet another lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO). Yet again, the now-deceased terrorists were engaged in narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific."</p><p>"The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and was carrying narcotics," he continued. "Three male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the strike, which was conducted in international waters. All three terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed in this strike."</p><p>This is the ninth vessel strike since September and the second strike reported in the Eastern Pacific. A total of 37 have reportedly been killed while two survived and were later repatriated to their home countries.</p><p>"These strikes will continue, day after day," Hegseth said on Wednesday. "These are not simply drug runners—these are narco-terrorists bringing death and destruction to our cities. These DTOs are the 'Al Qaeda' of our hemisphere and will not escape justice. We will find them and kill them, until the threat to the American people is extinguished."</p><p>The Pentagon has refused to release the identities of those killed or evidence of drugs on board.</p><p>The Trump administration has been scrutinized in recent weeks over the strikes, including by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who raised concerns about killing people without due process and the possibility of killing innocent people.</p><p>In a recent interview, Paul cited Coast Guard statistics that show a significant percentage of boats boarded for suspicion of drug trafficking are innocent.</p><p>The senator has also argued that if the administration plans to engage in a war with Venezuela, as it has targeted boats in recent weeks it claims are transporting drugs for the Venezuela-linked Tren de Aragua gang, it must seek a declaration of war from Congress.</p></body></div></body></html>

The two-time NFL MVP remains listed as questionable for this Sunday’s game against the Chicago Bears, but he was a limited practice participant on Wednesday.</p><p>An Instagram post from Ravens punter Jordan Stout that appeared to show Jackson playing a video game could have contributed to the decision to remove certain items from the locker room.

Stephen Lynch, the Democratic ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, was asked if the committee was interested in speaking to the 65-year-old disgraced royal as part of their investigation into the Epstein files.</p><p>"We would be extremely interested in hearing from Prince Andrew regarding his involvement in all this, yes," Lynch said.</p><p>Lynch said he was "sure" that the committee would issue an invitation for Andrew to provide his testimony in relation to the case.</p><p>He explained that the committee had already spoken to several Epstein survivors as part of their investigation.</p><p>"I think for those on our committee, both Democrat and Republican, who have seen the pain and anguish that has been experienced by these women, it will only increase our interest in speaking to everyone who was involved here," Lynch said.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to the House Oversight Committee's representative for comment.</p><p>The House Oversight Committee is currently looking into a number of issues surrounding Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, including the Epstein files — a large collection of documents related to the disgraced financier's sex-trafficking operation and other official investigations.</p><p>Giuffre alleged in a 2015 court affidavit that she was trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell and forced at age 17 to have sexual encounters with Andrew in London, New York and on Epstein’s private island.</p><p>In 2021, Giuffre filed a sexual abuse lawsuit in New York against Andrew, who has consistently denied all allegations.</p><p>After a U.S. judge rejected Andrew's bid to dismiss the case, the two sides reached an out-of-court settlement in February 2022.</p><p>Andrew did not admit liability but agreed to pay Giuffre an undisclosed sum and to make a donation to a charity supporting abuse victims.</p><p>Epstein died in prison in August 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.</p><p>In December 2021, Maxwell was found guilty of sex trafficking of a minor and conspiracy to entice and transport minors for illegal sex acts.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A legal group says a Hawaii middle school history teacher was disciplined by school officials after a Constitution Day lesson that discussed Charlie Kirk.</p><p>The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) sent a warning letter to the Hawaii Department of Education on Oct. 16 alleging the teacher's free speech rights were violated.</p><p>The letter, which redacted the names of the teacher, school and administrators, said the incident occurred on Sept. 17 when the teacher taught the Bill of Rights as part of her federally mandated Constitution Day lesson. During a class discussion, the teacher explained that "hate speech" is protected under the Constitution, prompting a student to reference the Sept. 10 killing of Kirk, saying he "was killed for his speech."</p><p>The teacher then asked students to name other figures who were killed for their speech. Students identified Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln, according to the ACLJ.</p><p>Another student mentioned that someone tried to assassinate President Donald Trump for his speech, while another student implied that such an act would be acceptable.</p><p>The teacher immediately corrected the student, according to the letter, telling the class that calls for death are not protected speech and that violence is never an acceptable response to disagreement.</p><p>During her next class, another student again brought up Kirk's murder, and the teacher agreed he had been shot because of his speech.</p><p>The ACLJ maintains that the teacher did not express any political opinions and remained neutral throughout the discussion. Later that day, however, she was called into a meeting with the vice principal, who said the discussion about Kirk was considered too "controversial" for the classroom.</p><p>A parent had reportedly complained about the conversation, and the vice principal told the teacher she was required to "shut down" any further discussion of controversial topics. A week later, he emailed a memo warning that she would face discipline if she failed to comply.</p><p>The ACLJ said that directive violates state education policy, which allows student discussions on issues that "generate opposing points of view" as a "normal part of the learning process." Furthermore, the group argued the teacher had included the Bill of Rights lesson in her syllabus, so parents were aware of the topic in advance.</p><p>In a later meeting with the vice principal and principal, the teacher challenged the memo and was allegedly told she could only discuss the First Amendment in the context of America’s founding, not in relation to current events.</p><p>The principal said the memo would be placed in her file but denied it was punitive, saying it would give administrators "a leg to stand on" if they decided to discipline her in the future.</p><p>The ACLJ argues the school violated the teacher’s First Amendment rights and engaged in viewpoint discrimination by targeting her while allowing other teachers to connect constitutional issues to modern examples.</p><p>The group requested the immediate removal of the memo from the teacher's file and assurances that no further discipline over the matter or her advocacy would occur.</p><p>It also seeks written confirmation that teachers will not be forced to silence students during approved lessons and that instruction on constitutional rights will not be deemed "controversial."</p><p>The ACLJ told Fox News Digital it has pushed back the original October 23 deadline for the Hawaii Department of Education to respond, to November 6, before deciding whether to file a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, alleging the teacher’s civil rights were violated and that officials interfered with federally required Constitution Day lessons.</p><p>The Hawaii Department of Education did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p><p>Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, was killed on Sept. 10 while debating on a Utah campus.</p><p>The conservative influencer's death has sparked a wave of campus activism focused on free speech.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trading barbs from light-hearted to vicious, mayoral candidates make final appeal to New Yorkers</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New York City mayoral contenders relentlessly criticized their opponents as they made their final pitch to voters Wednesday night in the last debate before early voting starts Saturday. </p><p>Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, Independent candidate and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa once again traded barbs on the debate stage, meeting for the second time in less than a week.</p><p>Wednesday's debate at LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City came as billionaires called for Sliwa to drop out of the mayoral race this week to consolidate support for Cuomo against Mamdani and as more than 650 rabbis nationwide, including those from the largest New York City synagogues, signed an open letter condemning Mamdani for what they said was anti-Israel rhetoric. </p><p>Both issues were on full display Wednesday night as Mamdani fielded questions about his support for Israel. When asked if Mamdani has any regrets about his "longstanding" anti-Israel views, the democratic socialist affirmed his commitment to protecting Jewish New Yorkers. </p><p>"You won't denounce ‘globalize the intifada,’ which means, ‘Kill Jews.’ There's unprecedented fear in New York. It was not several rabbis. It was 650 rabbis who signed the letter, not several," Cuomo said. While Mamdani refused to condemn the phrase "globalize the intifada" during the primary, he has since said he would "discourage" others from using the slogan. </p><p>"I've heard from Jewish New Yorkers about their fears about antisemitism in this city, and what they deserve is a leader who takes it seriously, who roots it out of these five boroughs, not one who weaponizes it as a means by which to score political points on a debate stage," Mamdani fired back in a fiery moment. </p><p>Sliwa also chimed in, telling Mamdani that Jewish New Yorkers are "frightened" and "scared."</p><p>"They view you as the arsonist who fanned the flames of antisemitism," Sliwa charged, accusing him of being in support of a "global jihad." New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand issued an apology earlier this year for "mischaracterizing Mamdani’s record" when she made the same suggestion. </p><p>"I have never, not once, spoken in support of global jihad," Mamdani said. "That is not something that I have said and that continues to be ascribed to me. And, frankly, I think much of it has to do with the fact that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice of winning this election."</p><p>Moderators for the final New York City mayoral debate were Spectrum News NY1 Political Anchor Errol Louis, WNYC’s Brian Lehrer and The City's Katie Honan. </p><p>The first question posed to candidates during Wednesday's debate focused on the federal raid in New York City's Chinatown neighborhood on Tuesday that led to the arrest of nine migrants from West Africa who were in the United States illegally, according to the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. </p><p>All three candidates agreed that the Trump administration was beyond its jurisdiction on Tuesday. Cuomo called the raid "dangerous."</p><p>"You don't send ICE in without coordinating with our police," Cuomo said, arguing he would have personally called President Donald Trump if he was mayor to tell him the administration was "way out of bounds." Sliwa agreed that the matter should have been left up to the NYPD. </p><p>Mamdani took the criticism a step further, calling ICE a "reckless entity that cares little for the law and even less for the people that they're supposed to serve," urging an "end to the chapter of collaboration between City Hall and the federal government, which we've seen under" Mayor Eric Adams. Adams is no longer seeking re-election after he built a reputation for his willingness to collaborate with the Trump administration on immigration reform. </p><p>At one point, candidates were allowed to ask their opponents a question, sparking a tense moment between Cuomo and Mamdani. Cuomo asked how Mamdani could pose for a photo with an anti-LGBTQ advocate. Mamdani said had he known, he wouldn't have agreed to take the picture. </p><p>Mamdani clapped back, asking Cuomo, "What do you say to the 13 women that you sexually harassed?" Cuomo has continued to deny the allegations and said the cases were dropped. </p><p>The latest Fox News survey, conducted Oct. 10-14, ahead of the first general election debate last week, revealed that Mamdani has gained a substantial lead in the race because voters see him as the best candidate to tackle the city’s top problems. </p><p>According to the poll, Mamdani has a 21-point lead among New York City registered voters with 49% of voters backing Mamdani, while 28% go for Cuomo and 13% favor Sliwa. Mamdani also rose above the 50% threshold among likely voters, garnering 52% support, while Cuomo picked up 28%, and Sliwa received just 14%.</p><p>But as Mamdani, ever the social media-savvy candidate, warned his followers on Wednesday, it was Cuomo who was the favorite to win the nomination just weeks before the Democratic primary. By consolidating support with New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, cross-endorsing each other to topple Cuomo through ranked-choice voting, Mamdani pulled the political upset that has since landed him on the national stage. </p><p>Since winning the primary, Trump has labeled Mamdani a "100% Communist Lunatic" and "my little Communist." Mamdani has rejected that moniker, affirming he is a democratic socialist. </p><p>Nevertheless, the odd-year election has captivated a national audience at a time when Democrats are still grappling with devastating losses last year. And with Trump back in the White House, Democrats nationwide are seeking to capitalize on growing discontent over his sweeping, second-term agenda. </p><p>Less than two hours before candidates took the stage Wednesday, The New York Times reported that Mamdani intends to keep New York City Police Department (NYPD) Commissioner Jessica Tisch on as his police commissioner if elected in November, citing two senior campaign aides and two more sources who were briefed on the plans. </p><p>"I can confirm that reporting," Mamdani said on the debate stage. "My administration will be relentless in its pursuit of safety and affordability for every New Yorker, and the delivery of that will require us to put together a team of the best and the brightest."</p><p>Mamdani applauded Tisch for taking on a "broken status quo charter to deliver accountability, rooting out corruption and reducing crime across the five boroughs." Cuomo and Sliwa also confirmed they would keep her on as commissioner if elected. </p><p>The Democratic nominee has faced a slew of criticism on the campaign trial for his past comments, including calling the NYPD "racist, anti‑queer &amp; a major threat to public safety" in 2020, among other insults. Mamdani made a public apology to the NYPD during a Fox News interview last week. </p><p>Ahead of those competitive midterm elections expected next year, Republicans have already seized on Mamdani's progressive politics, including Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who is considering a run for governor. Her campaign said in a recent statement, "Kathy Hochul literally has endorsed a full blown jihadist pro-terrorism Mayor of New York City."</p><p>Gov. Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., endorsed Mamdani last month after previously withholding her support. Fellow New York Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have still yet to coalesce behind the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, although Jeffries indicated this week that a decision is imminent. </p><p>This week, Red Apple Media CEO John Catsimatidis and hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman urged Sliwa to drop out of the race, arguing that a vote for Sliwa is a vote for Mamdani. The New York Post editorial board even joined the calls for Sliwa to drop out, but the Republican nominee has maintained he is staying in the race. </p><p><i>Fox News' Kirill Clark contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Speaking from the Oval Office on Wednesday evening, President Donald Trump said the U.S. will "hit" drug smugglers attempting to enter the U.S. by land after a series of lethal strikes on cartel boats at sea.</p><p>The president was questioned about his use of military force to crack down on drug smugglers in the Caribbean and Pacific following the eighth such strike in recent weeks.</p><p>Trump acknowledged "it is violent" but said that "every one of those boats that gets knocked out is saving 25,000 American lives."</p><p>"We have the greatest military in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And you see a little bit of it there, one shot, every one dead center. And the only way you can’t feel bad about it is you realize … that every time you see that happen, you're saving 25,000 American lives.</p><p>"Whenever I see that, I say to myself, I just saved 25,000 lives."</p><p>Trump said, after these strikes, "there are very few boats traveling on the water, so now they'll come in by land to a lesser extent.</p><p>"And they will be hit on land also."</p><p>Pressed on whether he has legal authority to unleash strikes on drug smugglers on U.S. territory, Trump answered confidently, "Yes, we do."</p><p>"We have legal authority. We're allowed to do that," he said, noting that "if we do it by land, we may go back to Congress.</p><p>"We'll probably go back to Congress and explain exactly what we're doing when we come to the land. We don't have to do that.</p><p>"This is a national security problem," Trump added. "They killed 300,000 Americans last year, and that gives you legal authority.</p><p>"We will hit them very hard when they come in by land. They haven't experienced that yet, but now we're totally prepared to do that.</p><p>"Something very serious is going to happen. The equivalent of what's happening by sea. And we're going to Congress just to tell them what we're doing, just to keep them informed. But we have to do it for national security. We have to do it to save lives."</p><p>Secretary of War Pete Hegseth announced Wednesday that, at Trump’s direction, the military carried out its first kinetic strike on "narco-terrorists" in the Eastern Pacific.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>An Arkansas father made a heartbreaking discovery over the weekend when he found his 13-year-old son dead after a 200-foot fall from a bluff at Buffalo National River, officials said.</p><p>The tragedy unfolded Saturday, Oct. 18, when the Searcy County Sheriff’s Office received a report around 11 a.m. that a 13-year-old boy had fallen from a cliff near Brewer Bluff in the park’s Middle District, according to a Facebook post from Buffalo National River.</p><p>Park staff and first responders, including search-and-rescue volunteers, fire crews and Survival Flight, responded. Members of the Harrison Fire Department rappelled about 260 feet down the bluff as park rangers approached from the river below.</p><p>The teenager, later identified as Kayleb Lynn Eddings, was found unresponsive by his father, Toby Eddings, who was among the first to reach his son, according to KHBS.</p><p>"Buffalo National River staff and I send our condolences to this young man’s family," said park Superintendent Angela Boyers. "We also thank the responders from the local communities that showed up to assist with this incident."</p><p>Officials said the 13-year-old had been with a friend when he lost his footing near the edge of the overlook. He slipped from a lookout point and fell about 200 feet, the Department of the Interior said.</p><p>The National Park Service (NPS) and Searcy County Sheriff’s Office are jointly investigating the fall.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, which oversees the NPS, said there are no advisories in the area and there is no danger to the public.</p><p>Officials reminded visitors that the terrain in the Buffalo National River area "can be rugged and steep," urging people to stay a safe distance from the edge when enjoying overlooks.</p><p>Eddings was an eighth grader at Ozark Mountain School District, remembered by his family as a kind, joyful boy whose "bright, jovial personality had no rival," according to his obituary.</p><p>"While there are many words to describe Kayleb, the most accurate and profound word is LOVE," his family wrote in his obituary. "Kayleb was loved by everyone who had the fortune to meet him."</p><p>He loved riding his four-wheeler, collecting Hot Wheels with his dad, hunting with his grandfather and spending time with friends. "Most of all," his family wrote, "he loved aggravating his younger brothers and absolutely adored his youngest brother, Bean."</p><p>"There are no words to express the deafening quiet that has filled the space where Kayleb’s voice once reverberated," his family wrote. "While that space will never be filled, one can find comfort in the whispering of the wind, the flutter of a butterfly, the beauty of a buck and most of all, the eternal presence of God."</p><p>A celebration of life will be held Thursday, Oct. 23, at 2:30 p.m. at the St. Joe School gymnasium in St. Joe, Arkansas.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A security expert told Fox News Digital the first 48 hours are critical in the search for an American Christian missionary kidnapped in the West African nation of Niger, who may have already been moved between Islamic State-controlled areas where an ISIS offshoot operates.</p><p>Bryan Stern, founder of the crisis response group Grey Bull Rescue, said in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital that in most organized kidnappings, those who seize a hostage are rarely the same people who hold them.</p><p>"What happens in most of these cases is whoever took the hostage isn't who's holding on to the hostage," Stern said. "The people who hold hostages generally are a lot smarter, a lot more capable, less disposable… so getting to them as soon as possible does matter in a very demonstrable way."</p><p>Stern said every passing hour reduces the chance of recovery. In many cases, hostages are quickly traded or sold between groups with differing motives — from ransom to propaganda — making it difficult to know what the captors want.</p><p>"It's easy to understand who took somebody, but once people start getting traded around like cards and stuff, it's hard to then understand what the current holding party wants," he said.</p><p>The groups often operate with their own chain of command and pecking order, each with different goals and levels of influence.</p><p>"All those different things play into how you’re gonna get somebody back, and the most dangerous thing to do is send ninjas in and shoot everybody," Stern said. "That’s the most highest-risk thing that we do because there’s no margin for error."</p><p>U.S. officials confirmed they are aware of the kidnapping, which took place in Niamey, about 100 yards from Niger’s presidential palace. The missionary, a pilot for the evangelical group Serving in Mission, was reportedly taken north toward an area controlled by an ISIS offshoot.</p><p>A State Department spokesperson said embassy officials are working closely with local authorities and that the Trump administration views the safe return of the U.S. citizen as a top priority. The U.S. Embassy has also restricted staff movements to armored vehicles and prohibited visits to restaurants and open-air markets.</p><p>Stern described the region as "31 flavors," meaning there is everything from Russian proxies to criminal gangs and Islamic fundamentalists running around.</p><p>While it’s easy to assume Islamist militants were behind the abduction, Stern cautioned, "until you know…it becomes speculation."</p><p>"At some point, somebody will ask for something, you hope," he said. "It’s very scary when they don’t ask for anything… the worst case scenario is a hostage taken by someone who doesn’t want anything. Then there’s no play to be made other than find them and kill them, and hopefully you survive that process."</p><p>For now, the focus is on finding proof of life and establishing communication.</p><p>U.S. special operations units are likely monitoring surveillance and communications from the region, but Stern cautioned that a rescue attempt would be "the most dangerous thing special operations does."</p><p>Officials have not said whether any group has claimed responsibility or issued any demands.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Michael Dorgan and Paul Tilsley contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Ed Orgeron hoisted the trophy after the LSU Tigers defeated the Clemson Tigers in the 2020 College Football Playoff national championship game.</p><p>But just 21 months after coaching the 2019 LSU team to a perfect 15-0 record and a national title and helping assemble one of the greatest college football teams in history, LSU announced Orgeron would depart the program at the end of that season.</p><p>Orgeron reflected on his memorable championship run with LSU. During a recent appearance on "Andy &amp; Ari On3," the former Tigers coach boldly claimed that the 2019 team was superior to any other college football team ever assembled.</p><p>"There’s some great teams out there," Orgeron said. "But that team that we had — I haven’t seen the talent."</p><p>"Especially when you look at Joe Burrow, you look at Ja’Marr Chase, you look at Justin Jefferson and see what they are doing in the NFL. Now, obviously, there was one or two players that could have played with us or been stars on our team. But, overall, that collection of talent — now, the 2001 Miami team, it was a great team, a great collection of talent. I think you got to mention them."</p><p>Orgeron was an assistant coach on the 2001 Miami Hurricanes team that won the Bowl Championship Series national title.</p><p>Joe Burrow was the top overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. That same year, the Minnesota Vikings used a first-round draft pick on Justin Jefferson, the 2022 NFL Offensive Player of the Year.</p><p>Ja'Marr Chase joined Burrow in Cincinnati when the Bengals selected him No. 5 overall in the 2021 NFL Draft. </p><p>"They always talk about who’s the best team? I say, ‘Hey, you got to win it on the field.’ It’s never been done, but I think those guys were tremendous," Orgeron added.</p><p>While the 2019 LSU team's undefeated record is notable, the team is also remembered for its dominance leading up to the national championship game. The Tigers never fell behind an opponent in any fourth quarter that year. The team also broke college football's all-time scoring record.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Democrats pulled out all the stops Wednesday to delay the vote on a short-term spending bill to reopen the government, the 12th time the Senate has considered the measure since the government entered a shutdown Oct. 1.</p><p>Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., embarked on a nearly 24-hour speech at 6:23 p.m. Tuesday, concluding his remarks at 5 p.m. the next day. Merkley, 68, warned viewers of the authoritarianism he said had become a facet of the Trump administration.</p><p>"Be aware and worried about the possibility of the use of an emergency in order to expand authoritarian power. That’s the position we’re in now in the United States of America. Authoritarianism with a rubber-stamp Congress, a court that’s delivering more and more power to the executive and an executive who has a well-planned strategy," Merkley said in his remarks.</p><p>"Republicans have shut down the government to continue the strategy of slashing Americans' healthcare."</p><p>He delivered his speech as lawmakers remain gridlocked over federal funding for 2026. While Republicans in the House of Representatives have passed a short-term funding bill to keep the government open through Nov. 21, Democrats in the Senate have voted a dozen times to defeat the package.</p><p>The Senate once again failed to advance the package on Wednesday. It failed in a 54-46 vote. </p><p>Democrats, led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., have demanded an extension of COVID-era supplemental funding for Obamacare healthcare subsidies that will sunset in 2025. </p><p>Republicans need the support of seven Democrats to overcome the 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster. The GOP holds 53 seats in the chamber. </p><p>Merkley, who came close to breaking Sen. Cory Booker’s 25-hour and 4-minute record set earlier this year, put the shutdown blame on Republicans throughout his discourse.</p><p>Booker praised Merkley's stalling efforts online.</p><p>"Listening to Senator Jeff Merkley for over 22 hours, it is clear that we need to stand up for our democracy. We must continue to call out and counter Trump's authoritarian tactics. Thank you, Jeff!" Booker said in a post on X. </p><p>On the issue of authoritarianism, the primary topic of Merkley's remarks, Merkley decried what he saw as the Trump administration’s attempts to push the limits on executive power, like its deployment of the National Guard to urban areas.</p><p>"If you remove a clear standard as to whether there is a rebellion and just say a president can deploy the military on a whim in places he doesn’t like against peaceful protesters to distract Americans or to exercise a suppression of dissent, then you have flung the doors open to tyranny, to a strongman state," Merkley said. </p><p>President Donald Trump has deployed the National Guard to Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles; Chicago; Memphis; and Portland, Oregon, citing a need to protect law enforcement and government operations in those cities.</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Actor Jeff Daniels performed a song inspired by the "No Kings" protests live on MSNBC's "Deadline: White House" Tuesday.</p><p>"When we interviewed Joan Baez for 'The Best People' podcast, we asked her what was different about the movements in the 60s," host Nicolle Wallace said. "She said, ‘Well, lots of things. But one of them, we had each other, and we had the music.’ On Saturday, 7 million Americans found each other at the 'No Kings' protest. And today, thanks to Jeff Daniels, we’ve got the music."</p><p>The "Tron: Ares" actor then performed a song he wrote called "Crazy World," which he described as "how I cope."</p><p>"I’ve seen a young girl smiling at something he just said/ I watched him fall until her pretty green eyes, his cheeks turned Valentine red/ I’ve seen an old man walking with his wife by his side/ I watched him reach down, take her hand, damned if I didn’t cry," Daniels sang as he strummed a guitar on the MSNBC set.</p><p>"This crazy world’s gone crazy. Who am I to judge?/ Nice to know in the world full of hate, there's someone out there still making love."</p><p>Before he performed his song, Daniels talked about the lack of "decency" from President Donald Trump, particularly in his AI video response to the "No Kings" protests.</p><p>"By the way, do we really have to treat people like that? You know, the meme that he had where he was flying with the crown and the, you know, spewing excrement all over the people down below," Daniels said.</p><p>"The country, America," Wallace responded.</p><p>"Would Lincoln have done that?" Daniels asked.</p><p>"I don’t think Nixon would have done that," Wallace remarked.</p><p>"Nixon wouldn’t have done it. Reagan wouldn’t have done it. Bush wouldn’t have done it — either Bush. I think people in the Midwest, where I am … we value our decency and our civility," Daniels said.</p><p>He added that he believed that decency and civility will matter again after people "vote for change" in the midterm elections.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to MSNBC for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Maine Democrat Graham Platner, a first-time Senate candidate backed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., says he has covered up a tattoo widely recognized as a Nazi symbol after critics unearthed old social media posts and demanded he quit the race.</p><p>Platner’s campaign is facing intense scrutiny after it was revealed he once had a skull-and-crossbones tattoo resembling the Totenkopf used by Hitler’s SS paramilitary forces. </p><p>Platner said he got the tattoo in 2007 during a "night of drinking" while on leave in Croatia in the Marine Corps and claimed he did not know its historical associations at the time. He has since covered the image with another tattoo.</p><p>In a video posted to Instagram Wednesday afternoon, Platner elaborated that the design was chosen from a flash tattoo wall while "carousing" with fellow Marines in Split, Croatia. </p><p>"We thought it looked cool," he said. </p><p>He claimed he had "lived a life dedicated to anti-fascism, anti-racism and anti-Nazism" and was "appalled" to learn it resembled a hate symbol.</p><p>Platner said he had never been questioned about the tattoo during his service and passed Army background checks.</p><p>He told The Associated Press he chose to cover rather than remove the tattoo due to a lack of removal services near his home in rural Maine.</p><p>"Going to a tattoo removal place is going to take a while," Platner said. "I wanted this thing off my body."</p><p>In the video, Platner said he had the symbol inked over with a Celtic knot and imagery of dogs, a tribute to his family pets. </p><p>"This far more represents who I am now than even the skull and crossbones did," he said, lifting his shirt to reveal the new tattoo.</p><p>The controversy comes on the heels of deleted Reddit posts in which Platner appeared to mock military sexual assault victims, criticize police and make racially-charged comments about tipping. </p><p>Platner since apologized and blamed the posts on depression and PTSD after his military service in Afghanistan. He has vowed to stay in the race and has the backing of Sanders.</p><p>Jordan Wood, a Democratic rival in the primary and former chief of staff to Rep. Katie Porter, is calling on Platner to drop out.</p><p>"Graham Platner’s Reddit comments and Nazi SS Totenkopf tattoo are disqualifying and not who we are as Mainers or as Democrats," Wood said in a statement. "With Donald Trump and his sycophants demonizing Americans, spewing hate and running roughshod over the Constitution, Democrats need to be able to condemn Trump’s actions with moral clarity. Graham Platner no longer can."</p><p>Platner said he believes the controversy is part of his life story, not disqualifying.</p><p>"I don’t look at this as a liability. I look at this as a life that I have lived, a journey that has been difficult, that has been full of struggle, that has also gotten me to where I am today," Platner told the AP. "And I’m very proud of who I am."</p><p>He blamed "establishment" forces for amplifying the backlash to derail his campaign. </p><p>"Every second we spend talking about a tattoo I got in the Marine Corps is a second we don’t talk about Medicare for all," Platner said in the video.</p><p>He is running in a packed Democratic primary against Wood and two-term Gov.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Growing up with famous parents, Melanie Griffith, Don Johnson and stepfather Antonio Banderas, left an indelible mark on Dakota Johnson — sometimes for the better and sometimes not. </p><p>"I don't think I ever truly realized what Hollywood was, but I grew up on set and was always surrounded by people who made movies," Johnson told Vogue Germany for its November cover story. "I mean, I was born in Texas because my father filmed there."</p><p>The "Fifty Shades of Grey" actress said she always knew her family’s profession was different from her classmates whose moms and dads went to an office each day. </p><p>"That was a challenge because it's hard to make and keep friends when you're on the road so much as a kid," she said. "But I always just accepted it: This is what we do. It's in our blood."</p><p>Because of that influence, Johnson said she wanted to be an actress since she was a kid and "be a part of what the people around me were doing."</p><p>"As a child, I was obsessed with movies," she told Vogue. "I was the kid who watched the same thing over and over again for a year. I think that shapes your imagination and what you think is possible for yourself, especially when you watch movies with other children, like ‘Mary Poppins’ or ‘Home Alone.’"</p><p>Johnson's parents, however, didn’t allow her to act as a child until she graduated from high school, with the exception of a small role with her mother in the 1999 film "Crazy in Alabama."</p><p>Despite all the positive exposure to a creative industry, having famous parents could be unsettling as a child. </p><p>"When I was little, there were times when it was really quite scary, and people would aggressively and physically try to get to my mom when we were just going to the supermarket or something," she said, adding, "If you accept that as normal as a little kid, it can lead to a lot of complexes."</p><p>She continued, "And then, of course, the fact that you're in the public eye and the world knows about your private life in a way that's very invasive, rude, and painful. So, yes, there are downsides, but there are also incredible upsides—like with everything, I think."</p><p>Griffith, who is best known for 1988’s "Working Girl," married Don Johnson, of "Miami Vice" fame in 1976, which lasted six months. They married a second time in 1989, shortly before Dakota was born, and divorced in 1996. </p><p>Griffith married Banderas in 1996, and they divorced in 2015. </p><p>Dakota Johnson has never been married. She was in a long-term relationship with "Coldplay" frontman Chris Martin until this year.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Border Patrol immigration crackdown expanding to San Francisco, sources say</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Trump administration has made preparations to expand its nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration in the San Francisco area with a team of Border Patrol agents, two U.S. officials familiar with the internal plans told CBS News on Wednesday.</p><p>The officials, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said Border Patrol's operations in the Northern California area could start as early as later this week, but that the timing could shift.</p><p>One of the U.S. officials said the Border Patrol agents would stage at the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, roughly 15 miles from San Francisco. That plan was reported earlier Wednesday by The San Francisco Chronicle. The Department of Homeland Security oversees Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Coast Guard.</p><p>The U.S. officials said Border Patrol commander <span class="link">Gregory Bovino</span>, one of the most visible faces of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, is expected to be involved in the operation. Bovino is currently leading Border Patrol arrests in <span class="link">Chicago</span>, where a judge on Monday <span class="link">ordered him to answer questions about agents' use of force</span> during those operations. He also oversaw the agency's controversial <span class="link">immigration raids in the Los Angeles</span> area this summer.</p><p>In a response to CBS News' request for comment, a spokesperson for DHS said, "DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens-including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists-in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco. As it does every day, DHS law enforcement will enforce the laws of our nation."</p>
<p>In a video posted on social media Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, denounced the Trump administration's plans, accusing the president of seeking to create "conditions for anxiety" in American cities.</p><p>"He sends out masked men, he sends out Border Patrol. He sends out ICE, creates anxiety and fear in the community, so that he can lay claim to solving for that by sending in the Guard in the first place," Newsom said.</p><p>Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker whose district includes most of San Francisco, issued a statement saying reports of what she called a "planned mass immigration raid in the Bay Area" are "an appalling abuse of law enforcement power. Broad sweeps that target families and terrorize law-abiding residents betray our nation's values and waste resources that should focus on real threats to public safety."</p><p>President Trump has recently floated the idea of <span class="link">dispatching federal agents to San Francisco</span>.</p>
<p>"We're going to go to San Francisco. The difference is I think they want us in San Francisco," Mr. Trump said in a Fox News interview that aired over the weekend.</p><p>On Wednesday, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said local residents would protest peacefully if the Trump administration uses "un-American tactics to target immigrant communities" in the area.</p><p>"This federal administration wants to divide us, but we know San Francisco is strongest when we come together to stand up for each other and our values," Lurie added.</p><p>As part of an aggressive expansion in deportation efforts across the country, the Trump administration has deployed teams of Border Patrol agents to large, Democratic-led American cities far away from a U.S. border.</p><p>As federal immigration officers, Border Patrol agents have the legal authority to arrest individuals suspected of being in the U.S. illegally anywhere in the country. However, they have expanded search powers in areas close to a coastal or land border.</p><p>In recent weeks, Border Patrol has been carrying out immigration arrests throughout the Chicago area, sometimes as part of operations at worksites and public places that have garnered <span class="link">local backlash</span>. Earlier in the year, Border Patrol launched a similar campaign in the Los Angeles area, arresting suspected unauthorized immigrants in <span class="link">Home Depot parking lots</span>, car washes and other locations. </p>

<div class="article-title">Semi truck driver arrested in deadly 10 Freeway crash was in U.S. illegally, DHS says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A semi-truck driver who was arrested for driving under the influence following a <span class="link">deadly crash on the 10 Freeway</span> in Ontario on Tuesday is in the United States illegally, according to officials with the Department of Homeland Security. </p><p>They told CBS News that 21-year-old Jashanpreet Singh is an Indian national who entered the country by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in 2022. He is a resident of Yuba City, California, which is located in Sutter County, about 120 miles northeast of San Francisco. </p><p>Singh was arrested on Tuesday by California Highway Patrol officers in connection with an eight-vehicle collision that included four commercial vehicles. The crash left three people dead and four others hospitalized in varying conditions. All of the victims were adults, Ontario Fire Department crews said. </p>
<p>San Bernardino County jail records show that Singh remains detained on Wednesday night at the West Valley Detention Center in San Bernardino without bail. He has been charged with driving under the influence of drugs causing bodily injury and gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated. He's expected in court on Thursday at the Rancho Superior Court in Rancho Cucamonga. </p><p>CBS Sacramento reporters spoke with Singh's best friend, Gurjot Malhar, on Wednesday evening. He told them that Singh came to the U.S. in search of a better life. </p><p>"He's an amazing guy. ... He would talk normally, happily, always with love and care," Malhar said. "Coming from India, it's gonna be hard to make dollars here. ... So, he wanted to keep going."</p>
<p>It's unclear if Singh currently has legal representation. CHP officers told CBS LA that they were investigating if Singh was driving with a valid commercial driver's license at the time of the crash.</p><p>In August, the U.S. government stopped issuing <span class="link">worker visas for commercial truck drivers</span>. At the time, a State Department spokesperson said that the pause was put in place "in order to conduct a comprehensive and thorough review of screening and vetting protocols used to determine the qualifications for a U.S. visa."</p><p>"As we have seen with recent deadly accidents, foreign truckers can pose risks to American lives, U.S. national security, and foreign policy interests," the State Department spokesperson said. "Ensuring that every driver on our roads meets the highest standards is important to protecting the livelihoods of American truckers and maintaining a secure, resilient supply chain."</p>
<p>California and Washington were <span class="link">sued by Florida</span> last week for a crash that happened in August that left three people dead after the driver of a semi-truck attempted to perform an illegal U-turn on the Florida Turnpike in St. Lucie County. The driver in that crash, Harjinder Singh, also entered the U.S. illegally and obtained a commercial driver's license from California, U.S. Marshals <span class="link">told CBS News Miami</span> in September.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that both states have failed to comply with federal safety and immigration-status requirements when issuing commercial driver's licenses. The suit says that California and Washington "chose to ignore these standards and authorize illegal immigrants without proper training or the ability to read road signs to drive commercial motor vehicles."</p>

<div class="article-title">Tropical Storm Melissa should be big rainmaker but path uncertain</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Tropical Storm Melissa, which formed over the Caribbean on Tuesday, is expected to bring lots of rain to the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Jamaica, but its path beyond that isn't clear, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said Wednesday.</p><p>Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, wasn't expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States.</p><p>Here's what to know about Tropical Storm Melissa:</p><h2>Tropical Storm Melissa forecast and path</h2><p>As of Wednesday night, Melissa's center was about 335 miles south-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and about 295 miles south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica. It was crawling west at only 1 mph, the hurricane center said. Maximum sustained winds were 50 mph, with tropical storm-force winds extending up to 115 miles outward.</p>
<p>On the forecast track, Melissa is "is expected to be nearer to Jamaica and the southwestern portion of Haiti later this week," the hurricane center said, and the storm could become a hurricane by Friday. </p>
<p>The storm is expected to continue to move at a slow speed, the hurricane center said, and eventually make a gradual turn to the north and north-northwest. The storm is then expected to turn back to the west by the end of the week, the NHC said. The storm is expected to gradually strengthen as it moves.</p><p>A spaghetti model from Wednesday morning shows multiple possibilities for Melissa's path. Some versions of the model show the storm passing over Haiti, though it's also possible Melissa travels over Cuba or turns toward Central America.</p>
<p>A hurricane watch is in place for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the Dominican Republic to Port-au-Prince, and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica.</p><h2>Rainfall forecasts</h2><p>Melissa is expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to the southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica through Saturday, with locally higher amounts possible, the center said. </p>
<p>Uncertainty over the storm's track and speed means there's less confidence in exact totals beyond that point. Significant flash flooding and landslides are possible, forecasters added.</p><p>The northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and western Jamaica are forecast to see 2 to 4 inches of rain through Saturday, while Aruba and Puerto Rico can expect between 1 and 3 inches of rain during that time. "Flash and urban flooding" also are possible, the NHC said. </p>
<h2>Will Tropical Storm Melissa impact the U.S.? </h2><p>Tropical Storm Melissa is currently unlikely to impact the mainland United States, the hurricane center said Tuesday.</p><p>The spaghetti model for the storm <span class="link">doesn't show it approaching South Florida</span> or the rest of the U.S. mainland.</p>

<div class="article-title">U.S. strikes 2 more alleged drug vessels, killing 5 people</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The U.S. has struck two alleged drug vessels on the Pacific side of Latin America over the last two days, killing five people, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth confirmed Wednesday. </p><p>The Trump administration has now carried out nine known strikes against alleged narcotics trafficking boats since last month, leading to at least 37 deaths. The first seven strikes were within the Caribbean Sea — but this week, the strategy broadened to the East Pacific.</p><p>The first strike took place on Tuesday, with two people killed. A defense official confirmed the vessel was in international waters off of Colombia. A second strike took place on Wednesday, according to Hegseth, killing three more.</p><p>In a pair of nearly identical X posts announcing the strikes Wednesday, Hegseth said the boats were operated by a "Designated Terrorist Organization" and were "transiting along a known narco-trafficking route" in international waters. He said they were "known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling." He did not specify the organization that allegedly operated the boats.</p><p>Hegseth said no U.S. forces were harmed in the strikes.</p>
<p>He also shared videos of the strikes, both of which show vessels moving in the water before they are seemingly hit and engulfed in flames. In the video from Wednesday's strike, bags or parcels appear to be floating in the water after the boat was struck.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona <span class="link">said Sunday</span> on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan," "We want to keep fentanyl out of the United States, ... but those routes through the Caribbean on boats are predominantly used to bring cocaine to Europe," not to the U.S. And fentanyl tends to be transported to to the U.S. "from a different way," Kelly added. </p><p>The Pentagon has not yet responded to a request for information about the nationalities of the individuals on the boat that was struck Tuesday.</p><p>Kelly also told "Face the Nation" that when administration officials briefed Congress on the drug vessel strikes, they "had a very hard time explaining to us the rationale, the legal rationale for doing this and the constitutionality of doing it." He said lawmakers were told there is "a secret list of over 20 narco organizations, drug trafficking cartels," but U.S. officials did not share the list with Congress.  </p>
<p>The Trump administration <span class="link">has told Congress</span> the U.S. is in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, arguing that the narcotics they smuggle kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, and this constitutes an "armed attack."</p><p>Two men <span class="link">survived</span> a U.S. strike on a suspected drug-trafficking submersible vessel in the Caribbean last week, and the U.S. <span class="link">repatriated</span> the men, one from Ecuador and one from Colombia. Ecuador released the man, identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño, after authorities said they had found no evidence that he had committed a crime.</p><p>The Colombian citizen remains hospitalized after his repatriation. Interior Minister Armando Benedetti said he "arrived with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator." Authorities there said he would face prosecution. Two other men were killed in the strike on the submersible vessel.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic granted permission to the U.S. military to use its airports for staging operations in support of counternarcotics flights, according to two American officials who spoke to CBS News on Wednesday under conditions of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about ongoing military operations. </p><p>The U.S. and the Dominican Republic have worked together on countering drug trafficking and other forms of transnational organized crime going back to the mid-1980s. </p>

<div class="article-title">Why food insecurity is becoming a growing concern in the U.S.</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Clinton, Missouri</em> — To grasp how <span class="link">big a problem hunger is</span> in rural America, spend time at a mobile food bank in Clinton, Missouri. </p><p>On this particular October morning, 74-year-old Lorna Hall is first in line in her car at the food bank. She tells CBS News she has been here since last night. </p><p>"I don't keep the car running, I can't afford the gas, so I have sleeping bags to stay warm," Hall said.</p><p>Others waiting in line share a similar raw reality. </p><p> "I still feel bad that I have to come up here and sit on a line, you know, to get food. It's embarrassing as hell," said Leo Barnett, who along with his wife Donita are among about 175 households who are receiving help on this day from the food bank. </p>
<p>"Thank God we've got it," Barnett said. "Or we are probably lying underneath a tree somewhere."</p><p>Pastor Marty Resz oversees the distribution.   "We're in serious times," Resz said. "I mean, people are struggling, cost of living is going up. Everything went higher."</p><p>Resz says the number of people coming in for help has about doubled. </p><p>"We used to see maybe 50 to 60 cars," Resz said. "It's doubled, and it's probably going to get worse." </p>
<p>The Mobile Food Bank is part of Harvesters, a nonprofit food network that says it feeds nearly 375,000 people daily in Kansas and Missouri.</p><p>But rising inflation along with cuts to government programs — <span class="link">including more than $1 billion</span> in federal food aid to food banks and schools — have translated into fewer donations than previous years.</p><p>One in seven people in 27 counties across Kansas and Missouri are food insecure, according to Harvesters. </p><p>Elizabeth Keever, chief resource officer for Harvesters, says the need is the highest it has been in a decade. And Harvesters expects more people to ask for help as the government shutdown continues and <span class="link">SNAP payments are withheld</span>. </p><p>"We have a rising number of people facing food insecurity and less resources to tackle it," Keever said. "…Folks that are utilizing food pantries, they're going to see less, unfortunately."   Another challenge is the recent Trump administration order canceling the annual U.S. Department of Agriculture report on food insecurity, claiming it has become politized. </p><p>"Without that vital data, we'd be operating in the dark," Keever said. </p><p>Meanwhile, those here in Clinton want to deliver a message to politicians bickering a thousand miles away.   </p>
<p>"Let's quit fighting," Barnett said. "Democrats and Republicans, come on. There's people out here starving to death." </p><p>Said Hall, "If Congress had to live on the budgets that we live on, they wouldn't survive."</p>

<div class="article-title">FBI releases new videos of 2021 D.C. pipe bomb suspect, as case still unsolved</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The FBI is reupping its call for information about <span class="link">an unsolved case</span> that has vexed the agency for years: the planting of bombs outside the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters the night before the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.</p><p>The agency released several new security camera videos of the still-unidentified suspect on Wednesday, offering up a more complete visual timeline of the person's movements on foot in Washington, D.C., both before and after the pipe bombs were placed.</p><p>The previously unreleased tape includes several videos of the person walking toward the DNC headquarters, where a bomb was placed at around 7:54 p.m. Eastern Time on Jan. 5, 2021. The FBI also showed new footage of the person walking toward the RNC moments before planting a bomb there at 8:16 p.m.</p><p>The suspect was last seen on tape two minutes later.</p>
<p>The new videos add to <span class="link">already-released footage</span> that shows the suspect walking around the Capitol Hill neighborhood and sitting on a park bench near the DNC building before planting a bomb there. The FBI says the suspect is 5 feet and 7 inches tall, carried a backpack and wore a grey hoodie, Nike sneakers, a mask, gloves and glasses.</p>
<p>The bombs did not detonate, but the FBI has described them as "viable" and warned they "could have seriously injured or killed innocent bystanders." The FBI says they were made out of 1x8-inch pipes, kitchen timers and homemade black powder.</p><p>The devices were discovered the following afternoon, on Jan. 6, 2021, as police in D.C. were overwhelmed by rioting at the Capitol, which is near both the RNC and DNC buildings. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who was the vice president-elect at the time, was <span class="link">evacuated from the DNC headquarters</span> when the devices were recovered.</p><p>Over the subsequent months and years, federal authorities tracked down and charged more than 1,500 people in connection with the Capitol riots, in a sweeping investigation that covered virtually every corner of the country — though convicted rioters were granted clemency by President Trump earlier this year.</p><p>But the pipe bombing case has remained unresolved. The FBI is offering $500,000 for information that helps it identify the suspect.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino listed the pipe bomb investigation as one of several unresolved cases that have gotten "additional resources and investigative attention."</p>
<p>"I receive requested briefings on these cases weekly and we are making progress," Bongino wrote in a post on X in May. "If you have any investigative tips on these matters that may assist us then please contact the FBI."</p>

<div class="article-title">Researchers seek to halt breast cancer recurrence by targeting "sleeper cells"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Pottstown, Pennsylvania</em> — Illeana Casiano-Vazquez and her husband Sam cherish every minute together. Six years ago, she was diagnosed with triple-negative <span class="link">breast cancer</span>, an aggressive form of the cancer that has fewer treatment options and a higher rate of recurrence.</p><p>"The first thing I thought about were my boys," Casiano-Vasquez told CBS News. "So, in the same feeling of, 'Oh my God, am I going to die?' sort of was this immediate like, 'I'm not going to die.'" </p><p>Chemotherapy and a double mastectomy eliminated signs of cancer. But naturally, she is still worried. </p><p>"The mental struggle that comes with the fear of recurrence is real and strong," Casiano-Vazquez said. </p><p>Dr. Angela DeMichele, Casiano-Vazquez's oncologist and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, told CBS News that Casiano-Vazquez had a 25% chance that the breast cancer would come back within five years. </p>
<p>DeMichele co-leads a team at Penn conducting a clinical trial that identifies and targets breast cancer "sleeper cells," which are cells that break away from the main tumor and can resurface later to spread cancer throughout the body. They published their results last month in the scientific journal Nature Medicine. </p><p>"The way that we follow patients, we are not going to, right now, find the cancer until it's already found its way to another part of the body, and by that time it's incurable," DeMichele explains. "So our goal was to find a way to identify the cells that actually were lurking."</p><p>There were sleeper cells in Casiano-Vazquez's bone marrow, so DeMichele gave her drugs to attack the cells.</p><p>DeMichele said that after six months of treatments, doctors were "so thrilled we could no longer see these dormant cells in her bone marrow." </p>
<p>There were 51 women in the Penn School of Medicine trial. After seven years, only two people saw the cancer come back, far below the expected rate, according to DeMichele.</p><p>"The next steps are to take this to larger trials to confirm this, and then to really see if this could also apply to other cancers," DeMichele said.</p><p>Casiano-Vazquez counts herself incredibly fortunate to have time with her now-teenage boys and their family rock band. She's now part of a follow-up study at Penn.  </p><p>"The only chance I have is if this clinical trial continues to work," Casiano-Vazquez said. "It's a chance that other women have, to give them hope that it won't come back."</p>

<div class="article-title">White House plans to demolish entire East Wing as ballroom cost hits $300 million</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Trump administration is planning to demolish the entirety of the White House's East Wing as early as this weekend, two senior administration officials told CBS News, part of a project championed by President Trump to add a ballroom to the complex.</p><p>Mr. Trump said Wednesday that the ballroom will cost $300 million — up from the $200 million figure that White House officials initially cited. The White House says the project will be funded entirely by private donors, some of whom have pledged seven or eight figures.</p><p>Construction crews <span class="link">were spotted tearing down</span> part of the East Wing's facade earlier this week.</p><p>The demolition work marks a reversal from earlier this year, when Mr. Trump said the <span class="link">90,000-square-foot</span> ballroom project "won't interfere with the current building." The East Wing was built in 1902 and renovated in 1942. </p><p>It was always the case that the East Wing would need to be "modernized" to enhance security and technology, administration officials said. But during the process of planning the new ballroom, it became apparent that the best option would be to demolish the entire structure.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the demolition focused on a portion of the East Wing that includes first lady Melania Trump's offices and dozens of other workspaces, according to sources familiar with the matter. The East Wing's movie theater will also be modernized, an official said.</p><p>The work has <span class="link">affected</span> the White House visitors' office, which handles public tours and events. Tours of the building — which typically start in the East Wing — have been suspended for about two months due to the construction, though officials say they expect to accommodate an updated tour route in the coming days.</p><p>The bunker under the East Wing will also be upgraded, sources told CBS News. The White House Military Office is handling the renovation of the bunker, which is known as the President's Emergency Operations Center.</p>
<p>The changes have <span class="link">drawn pushback</span> from some historic groups. Earlier this week, the nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation urged the administration to hold off on further demolition until the ballroom can go through a public review process, arguing the massive addition "will overwhelm the White House itself."</p>
<p>A White House official said construction plans for the ballroom will be submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission. Administration officials say there are three key stages in the process of building on federal property — preservation, demolition and construction — and the planning commission typically isn't involved until the construction phase.</p><p>Bryan Green, a Biden-era former member of the National Capital Planning Commission, confirmed to CBS News that the organization usually isn't consulted on demolitions — but he noted that it is atypical for a demolition to be separated from a construction application. He argued that projects like the ballroom should be presented to the commission early.</p><p>"This is part of our heritage. This is part of our story as Americans," he said of the White House complex. "And we deserve to have that conversation about its fate and what happens to it."</p><p>And for tourists outside the White House, the modifications to the complex have drawn reactions as polarizing as people's views on Mr. Trump himself.</p><p>"It's so funny, they are saying how Trump's destroying everything. Go back through history, all the different presidents," Joe Thompson told CBS News, pointing to other changes to the White House. "He's adding his touch, and it's going to be beautiful when it's done. Absolutely beautiful." </p><p>"I think it's disgraceful," said Mark, a retired physician. "It's a desecration, really. … I don't know that anybody particularly wants a big ballroom. And even for those people who did want it, the promise was that the White House wasn't going to be touched."</p><p>The White House has called pushback against the ballroom project "manufactured outrage," noting that many former presidents have modified the building.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump first teased plans to build a ballroom over the summer, the most dramatic in a series of changes he's made to the White House, from turning the Rose Garden into a patio to adding gilded decorations to the Oval Office. He has also discussed building a massive triumphal arch in Virginia, across the river from the Lincoln Memorial.</p><p>The administration has argued that the ballroom project will allow the White House to more easily host major functions like state dinners.</p><p>But some Democrats have criticized the plans and questioned whether donors — which include major tech companies — are getting anything in return. Democratic Rep. Mark Takano of California blasted reports that donors' names <span class="link">could be etched</span> into the ballroom's bricks.</p><p>"This is the White House — it's an emblem of our nation," Takano <span class="link">told CBS News</span> last week. "It's not like a NASCAR tournament, where all the sponsors are going to get their name emblazoned someplace."</p>

<div class="article-title">How cargo thieves trick businesses by posing as legitimate truckers</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Los Angeles</em> — On Tuesday, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department in Southern California announced the arrests of a dozen people accused of stealing millions of dollars in goods through a cargo theft ring that used legitimate trucking companies as cover.</p><p>But the goods they stole represent just a drop in the bucket of a nationwide problem: cargo thefts account for up to $35 billion in losses in the U.S. every year, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau,with many heists happening while shipments are in transit through sophisticated online schemes.</p><p>"People obviously are driving the freeways and they see commercial trailers up and down the freeway all day long, but no one really knows if that is a stolen load that they're driving next to, and or if it's just going from point A to point B," said Lt. Dave Navarro with California Highway Patrol.</p><p>It can be tough to spot, Navarro said, because many cargo heists start out looking like legitimate transactions. First, thieves steal a business's identity, then they trick shippers into handing over entire container loads.</p><p>That's how Utah-based Ari Bikes lost a truckload of almost 350 new bicycles.</p>
<p>Tyler Cloward, Ari Bikes' director of product development, says the company that signed up to deliver the load turned out to be thieves impersonating a legitimate trucking company's email. </p><p>"It looked completely real, everything checked out," he said.</p><p>Last November, Santo Tequila, a company owned by celebrity chef Guy Fieri, <span class="link">lost 24,000 bottles of tequila</span> worth over $1 million in a similar scheme, "60 Minutes" reported. Criminals created fake online profiles of trucking companies, bid on jobs they suspected might be valuable and hired unsuspecting drivers online to pick up the shipment.</p><p>But instead of sending the drivers to the Santo warehouse in Pennsylvania, the criminals remotely redirected them to take the shipment west — all the way to Los Angeles. About 11,000 bottles were eventually recovered by police, but the rest were never found. </p>
<p>As for Ari Bikes, after the company put out a call for help online, the biking community came through. A local shop sent a video of a man bringing one of the stolen bikes in looking for parts. Cloward got most of the bikes back, but he's still finding listings for the remaining ones at deep discounts online. </p><p>Navarro says if a deal looks too good to be true, it just might be, and customers can protect themselves by doing a little research on a seller before purchasing high value items online.</p><p>"Call the phone number, see if the phone number works, go to the website, see if the website works," said Navarro. "Do some checks and balances before you throw your money out there."</p>

<div class="article-title">University of Virginia reaches deal to halt DOJ civil rights investigations</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Justice Department announced Wednesday that the University of Virginia has agreed to abide by  Trump administration guidance ensuring the university doesn't engage in racial discrimination in admissions and hiring. </p><p>The move by the university is an attempt to bring to an end months of scrutiny by the Justice Department. Under the agreement, the university will provide the department with relevant information and data quarterly through 2028.</p><p>The Justice Department began reviewing the admissions and financial aid processes at the Charlottesville campus in April. Officials accused its president of failing to end diversity, equity and inclusion practices President Trump has deemed unlawful.</p>
<p>The mounting pressure prompted university president <span class="link">James Ryan</span> to announce his resignation in June, saying the stakes were too high for others on campus if he opted to "fight the federal government in order to save my job."</p><p>The president of the university will have to personally certify that the university is in compliance each quarter. Interim UVA president Paul Mahoney said in a message to the community, "After months of discussions with DOJ, I believe strongly that this agreement represents the best available path forward."</p><p>The university confirmed the agreement regarding the government's five remaining federal investigations in a statement and said that it did not include a monetary penalty or external monitoring and "it affirms UVA's academic freedom."</p>
<p>The university said that under the agreement, the government will suspend its current investigations, while university leaders will confirm its compliance with the Justice Department through 2028. At that point the government will conclude its investigations.</p><p>Mahoney said in his statement that the university's leaders would continue "our thorough review of our practices and policies to ensure that we are complying with all federal laws." </p><p>The university said Mahoney and other leaders have worked for months with the Justice Department to address its concerns about the university's compliance with federal civil rights laws and its response to  antisemitism allegations on campus.</p><p>According to Mahoney, the Justice Department closed two investigations into UVA in September after it provided information about its policies and actions. </p>
<p>Columbia and Brown universities have also signed agreements to end federal investigations and restore access to federal funding. Columbia paid $200 million to the government, and Brown paid $50 million to Rhode Island workforce development organizations.</p><p>The Justice Department had accused Ryan, the former UVA president, of engaging in "attempts to defy and evade federal anti-discrimination laws and the directives of your board." The department focused on complaints that Ryan was too slow to implement a March 7 resolution by the university's governing board demanding the eradication of DEI on campus.</p><p>As a public university, the University of Virginia was an outlier in the Trump administration's effort to reform higher education according to the president's vision. Previously, the administration had devoted most of its scrutiny to elite private colleges, including Harvard and other Ivy League institutions, accused of tolerating antisemitism.</p><p>Since then, the White House has expanded its campaign to other public campuses, including the University of California, Los Angeles, and George Mason University.</p><p>The Charlottesville campus became a flashpoint this year after conservative critics accused it of simply renaming its DEI initiatives rather than ending them. The Justice Department expanded the scope of its review several times and announced a separate investigation into alleged antisemitism in May.</p><p>Earlier in October, UVA <span class="link">declined</span> to sign an agreement pledging to uphold the Trump administration's higher education priorities, or risk losing out on preferred access to federal funding.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The U.S. gross national debt has surpassed $38 trillion for the first time, U.S. Treasury Department data shows.</p><p>The country's mounting debt comes as the <span class="link">government remains closed</span>, disrupting the economy as hundreds of thousands of federal workers go unpaid. </p><p>Government shutdowns can boost the national debt because they delay economic activity and postpone fiscal decisions, while pausing federal programs and starting them up again can also increase costs. The Office of Management and Budget estimated that a 2013 U.S. government shutdown cost $2 billion in lost worker productivity. </p><p>"Reaching $38 trillion in debt during a government shutdown is the latest troubling sign that lawmakers are not meeting their basic fiscal duties," Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on fiscal policy, said in a statement. </p><p>"If it seems like we are adding debt faster than ever, that's because we are. We passed $37 trillion just two months ago, and the pace we're on is twice as fast as the rate of growth since 2000," he added.</p>
<p>The longest shutdown in U.S. history, the 35-day stalemate in 2018, cost the economy $11 billion, largely to a reduction in spending by federal workers, according to the Congressional Budget Office. </p><p>In September, 81% of voters surveyed by the Peterson Foundation highlighted the national debt an issue of concern. According to economists, the growing mountain of debt leads to higher interest costs for the U.S. government. </p><p>Interest payments on the nation's debt are forecast to rise from $4 trillion over the past decade to $14 trillion over the next 10 years, curtailing public and private spending in key economic sectors, the Peterson Foundation said. </p><p>Rising U.S. debt could also undermine investor confidence in the economy, David Kelly, chief global strategist with J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a report earlier this month. </p>
<p>Credit rating agency Moody's <span class="link">downgraded the U.S. credit rating</span> in May from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1, reflecting investor concerns about the government's growing debt. The two other major credit rating agencies, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Ratings, have also lowered the U.S. rating. </p><p>Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a prominent voice on the nation's fiscal policies, also expressed concern at the national debt topping $38 trillion.</p><p>"The reality is that we're becoming distressingly numb to our own dysfunction. We fail to pass budgets, we blow past deadlines, we ignore fiscal safeguards and we haggle over fractions of a budget while leaving the largest drivers untouched," she said in a statement. "Social Security and Medicare, for example, are just seven years from having their trust funds depleted — and you don't hear anything from our political leaders on how to avoid such a disaster."</p>

<div class="article-title">Bad Bunny Super Bowl halftime show not being reconsidered, Goodell says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday, reaffirming a decision to put the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican artist on the league's biggest stage that led to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and some of his supporters.</p><p>Goodell addressed the Bad Bunny controversy at his news conference following the annual fall owners meeting. It is the first time he has commented on <span class="link">the move announced in late September that garnered worldwide attention</span>, including an increase in streams of Bad Bunny's music, along with backlash.</p><p>"It's carefully thought through," Goodell said. "I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism. It's pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching."</p><p>The 31-year-old born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. He decided to do a 31-day residency in Puerto Rico, avoiding stops in the mainland U.S., citing concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos.</p><p>He performs in Spanish and is expected to do so at the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>"We're confident it's going to be a great show," Goodell said, acknowledging there could be more talent added to the lineup along with Bad Bunny. "He understands the platform that he's on, and I think it's going to be exciting and a united moment."</p><p>The San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Super Bowl on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It is unclear if Trump plans to be there, though he has made appearing in person at major sporting events a significant part of his second term in the White House.</p><p>Trump in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax said he had "never heard of" Bad Bunny.</p><p>"I don't know who he is," Trump said. "I don't know why they're doing it. It's, like, crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it's absolutely ridiculous."</p>
<p>Goodell defended the decision on Wednesday, explaining it was made because of Bad Bunny's immense popularity.</p><p>"He's one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world," Goodell said. "That's what we try to achieve. It's an important stage for us. It's an important element to the entertainment value."</p><p>Echoing what senior VP of football operations Troy Vincent said Tuesday, Goodell said there has not been much discussion about the tush push quarterback sneak since an effort to ban it narrowly failed to pass in the spring.</p><p>Vincent said the primary concern is how tough it is to officiate the maneuver that the Philadelphia Eagles have successfully executed so often. It was not on the formal agenda at this meeting, though owners did get an update on penalties and other football matters.</p><p>"It's something we will continue to monitor on all phases, just like we do every other aspect of the game," Goodell said. "We don't have any proposals to bring it back up. It wouldn't surprise me if something does evolve. But it's not something we're really focused on during the season."</p><p>Asked about replay reviews and the length of time they are taking, Goodell said game times are actually down through the first seven weeks compared to last season, despite a surge in kick returns after an adjustment was made to the so-called dynamic kickoff.</p><p>"That's quite remarkable when you add the number of kickoffs," Goodell said. "You're going to get more fouls. You're going to get different sets of fouls. You're going to have a little bit (more) length of the game."</p>
<p>Goodell said he had breakfast with interim Players Association executive director David White before one of the league's international games this season but expects any talk about a move to an 18-game regular season and other collective bargaining discussions to wait until the union chooses its long-term leader.</p><p>The current CBA runs through the 2031 league year. White told The Associated Press last month that an 18-game season was not inevitable.</p><p>"The negotiations will be a lot more than just simply the 18 and two (exhibition games)," Goodell said. "There are a lot of issues that we are going to raise and I'm certain that the players will raise, and that's what it should be. That's what collective bargaining is all about. They're going to need time to make sure that they're prepared, that they're ready for the negotiations (and) they have their priorities straight, and then we can begin negotiations."</p><p>Goodell said work is being done to choose sites for the Super Bowl to cap the 2028 and '29 seasons and expects an announcement on those next year.</p>

<div class="article-title">New study compares side effects of dozens of antidepressants</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Antidepressants, medications used to treat depression, anxiety and other health conditions, can cause a wide range of physiological side effects depending on which one you take, according to a new study. </p><p>In the study, published Tuesday in the journal The Lancet, researchers analyzed more than 58,000 participants to compare 30 antidepressants with a placebo for an average of eight weeks, finding "clinically significant" differences between the drugs' effect on blood flow and metabolism. </p><p>The differences noted in the study include weight change, heart rate, blood pressure and total cholesterol.  </p><p>For weight change, researchers found some antidepressants, including maprotiline and amitriptyline, were associated with weight gain in almost half of participants — about a 4-pound average increase with maprotiline, for example. However, other drugs, such as agomelatine, were associated with weight loss in 55% of patients who lost approximately 5.5 pounds on average. </p><p>For heart rate, some drugs caused increases — like a 14 beats-per-minute increase on average for nortriptyline — while others caused decreases, such as an average decrease of 8 beats-per-minute for fluvoxamine.  </p>
<p>Kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels and heart rhythm were not majorly effected by most antidepressants, according to the study.  </p><p>These findings should not deter people from taking antidepressants, which remain effective treatments, the study's authors write, but instead should highlight the need for better tailoring of treatments to best fit a patient's health and preferences. </p><p>"We do know that these medications are life-saving and life-changing, but they can have variation from person to person depending on a person's metabolism, their age (and) what other medications they're on," psychiatrist Dr. Sue Varma, who was not involved in the study, said on "CBS Mornings Plus" Wednesday. </p><p>Untreated depression also can cause the side effects explored in the study, including weight gain or loss, Varma added, making it important to "weigh the risks and the benefits" of medications.  </p>
<p>She suggests doctors make it clear to patients that antidepressants can potentially exacerbate underlying conditions like elevated cholesterol or diabetes, make a plan to monitor side effects carefully and provide an array of lifestyle interventions.</p><p>"Let's not cause panic, but these medications do have really important side effects," Varma said.  </p>

<div class="article-title">Study finds courts' growing concern with DOJ</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>This week on 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley reported on the<span class="link"> Department of Justice</span>. Over decades, the department has built a reputation of trust with the courts. But now, in the early months of the second Trump administration, it appears some judges have doubts.</p><p>Pelley spoke with Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University. Shortly after President Trump was inaugurated in January, Goodman began a project to examine lawsuits filed against the administration. Today, that case number sits at more than 400.</p><p>Ryan Goodman: So we track all of the over 400 cases involving the Trump administration. And we basically select the cases only on the basis of what the judges and the courts themselves have said. We make no interpretation of it ourselves. So, for example, I could look at certain cases and believe that, in my view, the government is not in compliance with a court order. But we only include the case if the court is very explicit that it is the view of the judge themselves. So, there are actually many other cases that could've been included, but we exclude those so that it's as objective as possible and just fact-driven.</p><p>Scott Pelley: Break the research down for us. What does your report find?</p><p>Ryan Goodman: We looked at three categories of cases in which the courts have said something very explicit about the government's conduct. The first category is a court calling out the government for non-compliance with its orders. That one was over 15 cases, which I found jaw-dropping. The second category is the court saying to the government, "You've provided me with false, or highly misleading information, including false sworn declarations." That was an extraordinary one of over 35 cases. And then the last one is a particular area of administrative law in which the courts will make a determination as to whether or not the government's conduct is arbitrary and capricious, meaning that it really is not taking into account trade-offs, it's not reasoned. And arbitrary and capricious findings, we found over 50 cases in which the courts have actually said that their finding is that the government likely engaged in arbitrary and capricious conduct.</p>
<p>Some cases fall into more than one category. And since we spoke with Goodman, his team has found even more cases where judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents have criticized the Justice Department's work. In the most serious category, they've now found 20 cases where judges have questioned the government's compliance with their judicial orders.</p><p>Scott Pelley: How unusual is this?</p><p>Ryan Goodman: It's unbelievably shocking. Jaw-dropping. I don't have the words for it in some regards. The idea that you'd find this in so many different cases, and these are also some of the Justice Department lawyers are repeat players, and some of the judges are repeat players, but it's happening across the country.</p><p>Scott Pelley: What does this tell you about the Justice Department?</p>
<p>Ryan Goodman: So unfortunately, it suggests that the Justice Department is engaging in some of the most abhorrent behavior imaginable. And it's counterproductive for them. So I'm not even sure if they understand the long game because this is really about a relationship of trust with the courts.</p><p>Losing the trust of the courts, Goodman told us, has hurt the Justice Department.</p><p>Ryan Goodman: They get hurt in the short term as well as the long term. Short term, they need the courts to believe them. The Justice Department is not just a defendant. They're prosecuting cases. They want issues resolved their way on immigration, on sanctuary cities. Whatever the case might be, the Justice Department is hurting itself before the courts short term. And then I think long term, really significant damage in terms of this level of-- concerns about abuse within the Justice Department.</p><p>Scott Pelley: What's at stake?</p><p>Ryan Goodman: I think what's at stake is our system of justice. I think what's at stake is checks and balances within our system of government. I think the Constitution was basically predicated on the idea that these things would not happen. And the fact that they're happening in such rapid succession in a very short period of time, I think that means that the system really has to deal with an enormous stress.</p><p><em>The video above was edited by Scott Rosann.  </em></p>

<div class="article-title">Trump levies new sanctions on Russian oil giants in a push to end Ukraine war</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's administration announced Wednesday new "massive sanctions" against Russia's oil industry that are aimed at moving Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table and bringing an end to Moscow's brutal war on Ukraine.</p> <p>The sanctions against oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil followed months of calls from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well as bipartisan pressure on Trump to hit Russia with harder sanctions on its oil industry, the economic engine that has allowed Russia to continue to execute the grinding conflict even as it finds itself largely internationally isolated.</p> <p>"Hopefully he'll become reasonable," Trump said of Putin not long after the Treasury Department announced the sanctions against Russia's two biggest oil companies and their subsidiaries. "And hopefully Zelenskyy will be reasonable, too. You know, it takes two to tango, as they say."</p>
<p>The U.S. administration announced the sanctions as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte was in Washington for talks with Trump. The military alliance has been coordinating deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, many of them purchased from the United States by Canada and European countries.</p> <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the new sanctions were a direct response to Moscow's refusal to end its "senseless war" and an attempt to choke off "the Kremlin's war machine."</p>
<p>Bessent added that the Treasury Department was prepared to take further action if necessary to support Trump's effort to end the war. "We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions."</p> <p>The announcement came after Russian drones and missiles blasted sites across Ukraine, killing at least six people, including a woman and her two young daughters.</p> <p>The attack came in waves from Tuesday night into Wednesday and targeted at least eight Ukrainian cities, as well as a village in the region of the capital, Kyiv, where a strike set fire to a house in which the mother and her 6-month-old and 12-year-old daughters were staying, regional head Mykola Kalashnyk said.</p> <p>At least 29 people, including five children, were wounded in Kyiv, which appeared to be the main target, authorities said.</p>
<p>Russian drones also hit a kindergarten in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, later Wednesday when children were in the building, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. One person was killed and six were hurt, but no children were physically harmed, he said.</p> <p>Rutte, in his Oval Office appearance, went out of his way to underscore that the weaponry the U.S. is selling Europe to provide to Ukraine has been essential to helping stop many attacks like the one that ravaged the kindergarten.</p> <p>"We need to make sure that the air defense systems are in place, and we need the U.S. systems to do that, and the Europeans are paying for that," Rutte said. "It is exactly the type of actions we needed, and the President is doing that and trying everything to get this work done."</p> <p>Zelenskyy said many of the children were in shock. He said the attack targeted 10 separate regions: Kyiv, Odesa, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, Cherkasy and Sumy.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Peace efforts stall</h3> <p>Trump's efforts to end the war that started with Russia's all-out invasion of its neighbor more than three years ago have failed to gain traction. Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration with Putin's refusal to budge from his conditions for a settlement after Ukraine offered a ceasefire and direct peace talks.</p> <p>Trump said Tuesday that his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was on hold because he didn't want it to be a "waste of time." European leaders accused Putin of stalling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in what appeared to be a public reminder of Russian atomic arsenals, Putin on Wednesday directed drills of the country's strategic nuclear forces.</p> <p>Zelenskyy urged the European Union, the United States and the Group of Seven industrialized nations to force Russia to the negotiating table. Pressure can be applied on Moscow "only through sanctions, long-range (missile) capabilities and coordinated diplomacy among all our partners," he said.</p> <p>More international economic sanctions on Russia are likely to be discussed Thursday at an EU summit in Brussels. On Friday, a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing — a group of 35 countries that support Ukraine — is to take place in London.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy credited Trump's remarks that he was considering supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine for Putin's willingness to meet. The American president later said he was wary of tapping into the U.S. supply of Tomahawks over concerns about available stocks.</p> <p>Russia has not made significant progress on the battlefield, where a war of attrition has taken a high toll on Russian infantry and Ukraine is short of manpower, military analysts say. Both sides have invested in long-range strike capabilities to hit rear areas.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Ukraine says it hit key Russian chemical plant</h3> <p>The Ukrainian army's general staff said its forces struck a chemical plant Tuesday night in Russia's Bryansk region using British-made air-launched Storm Shadow missiles. The plant is an important part of the Russian military and industrial complex, producing gunpowder, explosives, missile fuel and ammunition, it said.</p> <p>Russian officials in the region confirmed an attack but did not mention the plant.</p> <p>Ukraine also claimed overnight strikes on the Saransk mechanical plant in Mordovia, Russia, which produces components for ammunition and mines, and the Makhachkala oil refinery in the Dagestan republic of Russia.</p> <p>The Russian Defense Ministry said its air defenses downed 33 Ukrainian drones over several regions overnight, including the area around St. Petersburg. Eight airports temporarily suspended flights because of the attacks.</p> <p>In other developments, Zelenskyy arrived Wednesday in Oslo, Norway, and after that flew to Stockholm, where he and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson signed an agreement exploring the possibility of Ukraine buying up to 150 Swedish-made Gripen fighter jets over the next decade or more. Ukraine has already received American-made F-16s and French Mirages.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Trump says Russia is on the agenda for upcoming Xi talks</h3> <p>The U.S. president is expected to meet next week with Chinese President Xi Jinping when the two leaders travel to South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.</p>
<p>Beijing has not provided Russia with direct support in the war, but has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry for use in its war against Ukraine, according to a U.S. assessment.</p> <p>Trump has said he believes the Russia-Ukraine war would end if all NATO countries stopped buying oil from Russia and placed tariffs on China of 50% to 100% for its purchases of Russian petroleum.</p> <p>"I think he could have a big influence on Putin," Trump said of Xi Jinping.</p> <p>Beijing has yet to confirm that Trump and Xi will meet.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Misty Copeland hangs up her pointe shoes after performing at retirement show</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>NEW YORK — Misty Copeland took one last spin on her pointe shoes Wednesday, showered with golden glitter and bouquets as she retired from American Ballet Theatre after a trailblazing career in which she became an ambassador for diversity in an overwhelmingly white art form.</p> <p>Copeland, who a decade ago became the first Black female principal dancer in the company's 75-year history, was feted at its star-studded fall gala at Manhattan's Lincoln Center. Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who gave speeches of praise.</p> <p>Winfrey spoke of the power of young people of color seeing Copeland lead iconic ballets like <em>Swan Lake</em>.</p>
<p>"Misty didn't just perform ballet," Winfrey said of the ballerina who has achieved a unique crossover fame. "She changed it. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead."</p> <p>In a way, the gala was both a return and a departure for Copeland, 43. She was dancing with the company for the first time in five years. During that time, Copeland has been raising a son, Jackson, with her husband. The 3-year-old came onstage to hug his mother during curtain calls, wearing a tuxedo.</p>
<p>Copeland has also been continuing her career as an author — the second volume of her <em>Bunheads</em> series appeared in September — and working to increase diversity in the dance world with her namesake foundation, including "Be Bold," an afterschool program designed for young children of color.</p> <p>But she decided to dust off the pointe shoes so she could have one last spin on the ABT stage — including as Juliet, one of the most passionate roles in ballet and her personal favorite. Copeland's Romeo in the balcony pas de deux was Calvin Royal III, who in 2020 became ABT's first Black male principal dancer in two decades.</p> <p>The duo later reappeared for another duet, this time a modern one, in <em>Wrecka Stow</em>, by Kyle Abraham. For Copeland's final performance of the night, she performed Twyla Tharp's <em>Sinatra Suite</em> with another of her favorite partners, Herman Cornejo.</p>
<p>The night, which also celebrated ABT's 85th anniversary and was curated in large part by Copeland herself, included speeches and film clips about her career. And her fellow dancers performed excerpts of ballets in her honor. At the end, a beaming Copeland was given a quintessential ballet farewell, as colleagues, teachers, friends and family came out to greet her, one by one, with hugs and bouquets while glittery confetti poured from the rafters.</p> <h3 class="edTag">On to the next stage</h3> <p>Though Copeland has not closed the door on dancing altogether, it's clear an era is ending.</p> <p>"It's been 25 years at ABT, and I think it's time," she told The Associated Press in an interview in June, when she announced her retirement. "It's time for me to move to the next stage."</p> <p>She added: "You know, I've become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying 'thank you' to the company. So it's a farewell. (But) it won't be the end of me dancing. … Never say never."</p>
<p>On the carpet Wednesday before her performance, she said: "I feel good. I feel ready to take this next step." She noted that she would be continuing her work promoting diversity: "There's so much work and effort that has to be continuous."</p> <p>Allen told reporters that Copeland had "helped to redefine the face of ballet. She's inspired millions of people around the world and hopefully, American Ballet Theatre will not wait another 50 years before they have another beautiful Black principal dancer."</p> <p>The evening at Lincoln Center's David H. Koch Theater was streamed live to nearby Alice Tully Hall across the plaza, with attendance free to the public — another sign of Copeland's unique brand of fame in the dance world.</p>
<p>Copeland was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and raised in San Pedro, California, where she lived in near poverty and through periods of homelessness as her single mother struggled to support her and five siblings.</p> <p>For a future professional dancer, she came to ballet relatively late — at 13 — but soon excelled and went on to study at the San Francisco Ballet School and ABT on scholarship opportunities. After a stint in the junior company, Copeland joined ABT as a member of the corps de ballet in April 2001, becoming a soloist six years later.</p> <p>In June 2015, Copeland was promoted to principal dancer. Unlike other promotions, which are announced quietly, Copeland's was announced at a news conference — a testament to her celebrity. Only days before, she'd made a triumphant New York debut in <em>Swan Lake</em> in the starring role of Odette/Odile, drawing a diverse and enthusiastic crowd to the Metropolitan Opera House.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Trying times for DEI efforts</h3> <p>In the AP interview, Copeland acknowledged that it's striking that when she leaves ABT, there will no longer be a Black female principal dancer at the company.</p>
<p>"It's definitely concerning," Copeland said. "I think I've just gotten to a place in my career where there's only so much I can do on a stage. There's only so much that visual representation … can do. I feel like it's the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture."</p> <p>She also noted this is an especially trying moment for anyone working in the area of diversity, equity and inclusion.</p> <p>"It's a difficult time," she said. "And I think all we can really do is keep our heads down and keep doing the work. There's no way to stop the people that feel passionate about this work. We will continue doing it."</p>

<div class="article-title">This nation has the fastest rising rate of cancer cases -- and deaths -- in the world</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Ali Mokdad stands in the heart of Beirut. Cars and trucks and motorcycles rumble everywhere.</p> <p>"If you look at a car passing by, you see smoke coming out of it — that's illegal in Lebanon. But nobody enforce[s] it," says Mokda, the chief strategy officer of population health at the University of Washington.</p> <p>As a result, Beirut has terrible air quality and is often submerged under a blanket of exhaust. And it's not just in the big cities — vehicles belch pollution across the country.</p> <p>It's one reason that cancer is surging in Lebanon. Mokdad co-authored a global survey that revealed that the tiny nation on the Mediterranean is experiencing the fastest increase in cancer incidence and mortality anywhere in the world. According to the study, published in <em>The Lancet</em>, the frequency of new cancer cases in Lebanon has increased by an astounding 162% from 1990 to 2023, with cancer-related deaths increasing by 80% over that same period. In 2023, for every 100,000 people in the country, there were 233.5 new cancer cases.</p>
<p>The news is sobering elsewhere too. The survey predicts that cancer cases and cancer deaths will continue to rise worldwide through at least 2050, especially in low- and middle-income countries.</p> <p>Still, Lebanon has reason to be especially alarmed.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>What's behind the dramatic rise in cancer in Lebanon</strong></h3> <p>Mokdad grew up in Lebanon before moving abroad almost 40 years ago. For him, like many here, the disease is personal.</p> <p>"I'm losing cousins," he says. "I'm scared. I'm losing them at a very young age. It's not only death. It's also diseases. They have so many health problems."</p>
<p>There are various reasons why cancer is surging in Lebanon. A big one is air pollution from both vehicles and diesel-fueled generators that many homes and businesses use due to unreliable state electricity.</p> <p>In addition, "we overuse chemicals for our agriculture," says Mokdad. Some of these compounds along with sewage ends up in certain rivers. "People don't drink it but they wash their tabbouleh and their fattoush with it. They're consuming this."</p> <p>By far the biggest risk factor, however, is smoking.</p> <p>"There is no more taboo about smoking," Mokdad says. "Everybody smokes. Kids smoke in front of their parents. Yesterday, I went with some of my friends for dinner. You come home, you stink of tobacco."</p>
<p>It's gotten to the point where Mokdad keeps a set of clothes in Lebanon that he only wears there.</p> <p>There are no public health campaigns warning against the dangers of smoking or secondhand smoke. Instead, Mokdad says the government is actually in the business of buying and selling tobacco.</p> <p>The inevitable result is that lung cancer rates have jumped nationwide. In addition, leukemia and pancreatic and liver cancers have risen. The increases in prostate, colon and breast cancers are all preventable through early screening and detection.</p> <p>The issue, says Mokdad, is that although screening is available, most people don't know to seek it out. "Health education is a problem," he explains. "If you caught [cancer] earlier," people wouldn't have to die.</p> <p>The global survey on cancer and Lebanon's troubling trends with the disease caught the attention of members of the Lebanese parliament. It's why they invited Mokdad to come talk to lawmakers and experts about his findings.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Change will be a journey, a slow one at that </strong></h3> <p>Earlier this month, Mokdad traveled to Beirut for the meeting, which was held inside one of the Parliament buildings. After walking through the results of the study and describing the peril that cancer poses, Mokdad suggested to the officials that Lebanon could improve its health screening, ban smoking in public spaces and launch a set of aggressive anti-tobacco ads. By way of example, he pointed to a public health campaign launched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. a decade ago, one that the CDC and other researchers say prevented 129,100 early deaths between 2012 and 2018.</p>
<p>Inaya Ezzeddine is a member of parliament and a physician who ran the proceedings. She explains that any kind of government response will take time. "It's a journey," she says. "It's not something that we can implement overnight because it has to do with a lot of sectors. We have to work hard toward this political will."</p>
<p>A committee will be formed to examine the data and determine which laws will need enacting or strengthening to address the problem.</p> <p>One of the attendees, Iman Nuwayhid, a professor of public health at the American University of Beirut, believes that individuals should take responsibility too. "We're accountable to making our country cleaner, reduce pollution, improve the environment," he says. "Of course, the government plays a bigger role, but we have a big responsibility. Local communities again should push in that direction."</p> <p>Mokdad argues that the time is now for the government to act and support people in making the right decisions about their health.</p> <p>"I know Lebanese have to deal with a lot of things," he says. "But cancer is killing. Many people in the parliament said, 'I'm not surprised with this finding.' And my question: What are you doing about it? Why have you been waiting so long to take action?"</p> <p>A couple blocks from the building where the meeting was held, a mother and son are seated outside, taking a break from work. The mom, 57-year-old, Najah Mourda, is smoking.</p>
<p>She says she's recently lost several loved ones to cancer — her mother, her sister and a close friend. "It's very dangerous and I'm afraid of it," she says.</p> <p>Mourda is hopeful that the government will do something, even while acknowledging that she shouldn't be smoking. She knows it's bad for her. She's tried to stop but hasn't been able to kick the habit.</p> <p>Her son, Marwan Bizri, looks on. "Lebanese people are dying because of cancer," he says. "We're losing people we love."<br/></p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Icelanders may be the last group of people on Earth to experience the pesky bite of a mosquito.</p> <p>This week, Iceland recorded the presence of the insects within its borders for the first time in the Nordic nation's history.</p>
<p>The discovery of three <em>Culiseta annulata</em> mosquitoes was confirmed Monday by the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, which said the mosquitoes likely arrived by freight and appeared to be able to withstand Iceland's climate. (There have been previous reports of mosquitoes found in airplanes in Iceland.)</p> <p>The institute noted that the mosquitoes were one of a number of new insect species discovered in Iceland in recent years due to a warming climate and the growth of international transportation.</p> <p>Insect enthusiast Björn Hjaltason said he found the mosquitoes on a farm in Kjós, just north of Reykjavík, earlier this month.</p>
<p>"At dusk on the evening of October 16th, I caught sight of a strange fly on a red wine ribbon," Hjaltason told Icelandic broadcaster RUV. "I immediately suspected what was going on and quickly collected the fly. It was a female."</p> <p>Hjaltason later trapped two more. All three insects were turned over to authorities for testing, which revealed that they were two female and one male mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Antarctica is now the only place in the world believed to have no mosquitoes.</p> <p>Climate change is causing temperatures to rise across the world, and the Arctic region is warming at more than double the rate of the global average.</p> <p>According to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, the species <em>Culiseta annulata</em> are large mosquitoes present in Europe and other Nordic countries that can live in cold weather, usually finding shelter in outbuildings and basements.</p> <p>Though they sting, the institute said they don't carry known infections in those areas. One study from 2017 said <em>Culiseta annulata</em> are often "regarded as a biting nuisance, rather than a deadly foe."</p> <p>There are more than 3,000 species of mosquitoes around the world, some of which can transmit severe and even fatal diseases through their bites such as malaria, dengue fever and West Nile virus.</p>

<p>TERRY GROSS, HOST: </p><p> This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. President Trump's immigration policies, his tariffs, enabling DOGE to fire or lay off tens of thousands of federal workers are all creating an environment of financial uncertainty. It's rattling consumers, as well as many businesses, investors and global leaders, and yet the stock market has remained high. Why?</p><p>To explain the impact of these policies and proposals, with an extra portion of uncertainty caused by the government shutdown, we invited the editor-in-chief of The Economist, Zanny Minton Beddoes, to join us. She's also the host of "The Insider," The Economist's new streaming show. She previously was the publication's business editor and economics editor and is a former economist for the International Monetary Fund. We recorded our interview yesterday.</p><p>Zanny Minton Beddoes, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Of all the financial moves Trump and his administration have been making, is there any one thing that you find most confounding or most...</p><p>ZANNY MINTON BEDDOES: (Laughter).</p><p>GROSS: ...Impactful? Yeah.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Well, first of all, it's very nice to join you again. That's a hard one to answer because, you know, what is remarkable is that in the face of a lot of shocks - some positive, many negative - the economy is doing remarkably well. And the stock market is doing remarkably well. And I think the sort of simple way to explain that is that on the one hand, we have a number of policy shocks - and I would put the president's immigration policy right at the top and his tariff policy right at the top, and we can talk about both of those - but also, generally, the uncertainty that surrounds what President Trump does. You know, he is very pro-business on one hand, but on the other hand, it's very, very hard to plan and predict.</p><p>But set against that, there is a frenzy, almost a euphoria in the United States right now around artificial intelligence. And that frenzy is driving investment, and it is really what is behind the stock market. So you have this sort of tale of two economies, if you will - the real economy right now in the here and now, I think, being hit by particularly the tariffs, and on the other hand, this optimism in the markets that comes around the expectations for AI.</p><p>GROSS: So how much of the stock market's boom right now is a result of AI? I think you've written that like 40% of...</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Yeah, a huge amount. If you look at really the stocks that are doing extraordinarily well, it is the Big Tech companies, the Magnificent Seven, as they're often called - Meta, Tesla, Alphabet - formerly Google - Amazon, NVIDIA, Microsoft and Apple. It is the Big Tech companies that are driving this frenzy, and then other companies that investors think are going to benefit from it. If you took those out, the performance of the stock market is much more lackluster.</p><p>GROSS: So for people who aren't invested in those companies, how are they doing?</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Well, if they're invested in the stock market at all, they're not doing nearly as well as if they were invested in those companies. And if they don't hold hold shares - and many Americans don't - then the economy is much tougher 'cause you're seeing inflation quite a lot higher than it really should be, maybe not as high as we might have feared six months ago, but still pretty high. You're seeing the labor market weakening. Although the unemployment rate hasn't risen very much, the pace of job growth was slowing. Of course, we don't exactly know what's going on right now because we aren't seeing any economic figures being published because of the government shutdown. But you can see...</p><p>GROSS: And the tariffs aren't all in place yet, so businesses really don't know what to do, so we're also not seeing the effects on consumers yet because of that.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Well, the story of the tariffs, Terry, is interesting because if you cast your mind back to the beginning of April, if you remember, President Trump stood in the Rose Garden with that big board on which somebody had printed countries and the new tariff rates, and it was called Liberation Day. And there were incredibly high tariff rates being proposed. And at that point- and I think you and I spoke soon after that.</p><p>GROSS: Yes.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: There was a very real fear that we would go into something like the 1930s, when there was a trade war, you know, globally, and the U.S. put up its tariffs under the Smoot–Hawley Act, and then other countries retaliated, and the Depression was made much worse by that. Compared to that outlook, it hasn't been as bad as we feared. In fact, I would be the first to admit that the impact of the tariffs has not been, in the short term, as dramatic as I think I probably suggested it would be back in April. And the reasons are severalfold.</p><p>Firstly, President Trump threatened a lot of tariffs and then backed down. You know, there's now this acronym, the TACO. He's the TACO president - Trump Always Chickens Out. And so a lot of the tariffs have not been put in place. Many countries, rather than retaliating against the United States with their own tariffs, have actually cut a deal with the U.S. And so if you went back to April, economists were looking at the threats the president made, and they thought that the overall average, what economists call the average effective tariff rate, which means the kind of average rate for the economy overall, was going to rise to something well above 20%.</p><p>In fact, if you look at how much revenue is being raised from tariffs, the actual rate right now is closer to just over 10%, which is still significant increase. It's still the biggest increase since the 1930s, but it's much, much less than people feared back in March. And then, not only is that tariff level lower, interestingly, many, many companies have not passed on the cost of that tariff to consumers. They have swallowed the cost of the tariff in their profit margins. And in the long run, that's not going to be possible. Companies will have to pass on to their customers the cost of the tariff. But in the short run, probably one of the reasons they haven't done so is partly, I think they're scared of being the target of the president's ire, but also because there's so much uncertainty, people aren't sure what is going to happen with tariffs going forward.</p><p>But all this means that right now, we haven't - I don't think - seen the full impact of the tariffs. It is going to put pressure on consumers in an ongoing way. And actually, if you look at some sectors of the economy, it's already hitting very hard. I mean, I'm sure you've been following what's happening to American farmers. It's really tough if you're in the farming industry now. And so you're seeing parts of the economy that are already feeling the pain.</p><p>GROSS: Well, the most consequential of the tariffs right now will probably be the tariffs with China and China's retaliation against the tariffs. And that's - there's threats, but it's not worked out yet. The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, is going to meet with China's No. 2 later this week. President Trump is going to meet with President Xi sometime soon, they say. So we don't even know what the result of that is, but Trump is threatening, like, 100% tariffs on Chinese goods. Or is it 100% in addition to what he's already proposed?</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: He - it's hard to...</p><p>GROSS: I lose track.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: You're right. It is hard to keep track, but China is a really interesting case. And it's, to me, an interesting case of a country that has stood up to President Trump and actually prevailed, because if you look at what happened - in April, there was a mini, you know, war of tariff threats between President Xi and President Trump. I can't even remember what it went up to, but they threatened retaliatory tariffs and counterthreatened, and at one point, it looked like they were both going to be well over 100%. But then, ineffectively, President Trump chickened out, and a deal was struck. And I think it shows that President Xi and China realize that actually the U.S. couldn't afford to put the kind of tariffs on China that it wanted to 'cause it would - just would have hurt consumers too much.</p><p>And now, if you fast forward to what's happening now, it's now China that is playing hardball with the United States. Just a few days ago, the Chinese laid out a new set of export controls and licensing requirements on rare earths, which are these kinds of base metals that are required and minerals that are required particularly for computer chips and for the magnets that go into all manner of vehicles and so forth. And they're also very, very important for the defense industry. China essentially controls the production of those rare earths, and it's just announced that it's going to require, you know, essentially a complicated licensing arrangement for anybody to have any access to rare earths. And it's really flexing its muscles and saying to the United States, we can play at this game of using our economic power as a weapon, too.</p><p>And I think what you're seeing, and the reason that there's a lot of uncertainty about the meeting now, both between the Treasury secretary and his Chinese counterpart and the president, is that there's a big game of sort of threats and counter-threats and chicken going on. And the brutal truth is that, yes, the United States has a lot of leverage over China, particularly in financial area, but China also has a lot of leverage over the United States. And it's really the one country that I think the U.S. can't essentially push around through using economic weapons.</p><p>GROSS: Do you think that Trump did not count on retaliation?</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: I think President Trump has a very strong sense of America's ability to use its military and economic power to push countries around.</p><p>GROSS: And also of...</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: And he's...</p><p>GROSS: ...His own personal power.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Yes. I think he's extremely good at that. He's extremely good at recognizing weakness in others and using the clout that he has as America's president to further, in - what in his view is, you know, America's advantage. I would not be so sure that often it is in America's advantage, but he sees it as that. But I think China is a case where he's sort of met his match, and President Xi is being as tough in return and is playing hardball.</p><p>And when President Xi's playing hardball, it becomes clear that President Trump is keen to negotiate, but - whereas with other countries, he and his team have been able to bully them into deals where they have agreed to pay tariffs on their exports to the U.S. because - for example, let's take the case of the European Union, very close to home here for me. You know, the EU did a deal with the United States, which essentially accepted tariffs on European goods going into the United States and made all kinds of promises about investing in the United States. And the reason that the Europeans went along with this is that they really, really need the U.S.' support in NATO. They're worried that, you know, President Trump would no longer be committed to the NATO alliance or indeed might try and push a very pro-Russia peace in Ukraine.</p><p>And so where the U.S. has clout in this administration, it's very effectively using it. I - there's a phrase that I've heard used to describe this, which is that the U.S. is monetizing its military and economic power. It is essentially - and the way the Trump administration would describe it, they would say, look, the international system was essentially rigged against us. And we are, you know, moving the goalposts more in America's direction. We're getting a fairer deal for America. But they make no apology about the fact that they are using America's power to push other countries to do something differently. But I think in the case of China, it's proving hard to do 'cause China also has power.</p><p>GROSS: My guest is Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of The Economist. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF HOWARD FISHMAN SONG, "DIRTY")</p><p>GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of The Economist. We're talking about the impact of Trump's tariffs, immigration crackdown and other policies and plans on everything from consumers to the global economy. We recorded our interview yesterday.</p><p>Something that I'm really struggling to understand is one of the things Trump is proposing is a 100% tariffs on brand-name drugs - not generics, but brand-name drugs - that are manufactured outside of the United States. He has an exception for companies working to try to manufacture drugs in the U.S. So if you add 100% tariffs to brand-name drugs manufactured outside of the United States and, at the same time, you're allowing - 'cause this is what Republicans are trying to do - you're allowing Obamacare costs to skyrocket for individuals on Obamacare, that's a kind of bad recipe for a lot of people's health care.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Yes, it is. But I think - to be fair to the administration, I think President Trump has identified something that he sees as an unfairness, which is that global drug companies sell their drugs more cheaply in other countries than they do in the United States. The United States is the biggest market. It's the place where the newest and best drugs come to market first. But consumers pay more in the United States, whereas in somewhere like in the U.K., where I'm from, where we have the National Health Service, the National Health Service drives a very hard bargain with drug companies and will only agree to buy drugs if they feel that they are not just effective but also cost-effective. And so they end up forcing the drug companies to sell at a much cheaper price.</p><p>And the Trump administration has basically said, this is not fair on Americans. We're being ripped off. But the sort of remedy that he has proposed, as you've described, of tariffs is not one that is going to help this. And certainly, the impact of having tariffs on imported drugs, plus the end of subsidies for health care, is a double whammy for the U.S. patients. Absolutely.</p><p>GROSS: So if you have, like, over 90 countries with different tariffs for each country and then cutouts for certain goods that Trump does not want to impose tariffs on, it sounds to me - and I don't know anything about the administration of tariffs, but it sounds to me like an administrative nightmare. And I've been wondering - is Trump going to have to reestablish part of the, quote, "administrative state" that he's been trying to destroy just to administer the tariffs?</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: You raise a very important point, which is - and this sounds abstract, but it's actually really important. For most of the world for the last 80 years, in the postwar era, we had a system of global rules for trade which was based on something called MFN - most-favored-nation status. And what that meant was - it was essentially a rule that said when a country imposed a tariff, it had to impose the same tariff on all countries. So you couldn't, you know, have one tariff on France and another tariff on India. If you imposed a 5% tariff on a good coming into your country, you'd impose it on everybody. And what the United States has done under the Trump administration essentially has completely thrown away that system and said, we're not playing by those rules any longer. We are going to have different tariffs for different countries. And indeed, we reserve the right to change those tariffs all the time, and we're going to threaten to change them.</p><p>And remember that President Trump has used tariffs not just to negotiate trade deals, but to impose punishments on countries for all kinds of things. You know, tariffs were imposed on Brazil in August because President Trump didn't like the way that the current government was, you know, prosecuting former President Bolsonaro. And he made very clear that was one of the reasons that very high tariffs were imposed on Brazil.</p><p>So if you're using tariffs to punish countries for all manner of things and you change your mind about tariffs a lot, you have, as you say, an incredibly uncertain system. And you have an uncertain system that has different tariff rates for all manner of countries. So yes, it's extraordinarily complicated and confusing. The other thing is that the U.S. has now recently got rid of what's called the de minimis provision. And the de minimis provision meant that any imports of a small amount - and I think it was up to $800 - were tariff-free. And those big Chinese consumer companies, like Shein, that were the ways in which people could buy very cheap clothes from China, they were coming...</p><p>GROSS: Very cheap. Yeah.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Very cheap. Yeah. I'm not passing judgment on whether they were a good idea or not. But they came in through this de minimis arrangement. And now lots of small importers - kind of mom-and-pop stores that import goods from China and then sell them on - they can no longer bring their goods in through that provision. And so it is - the impact is at the very least confusing. But I think you're right. It's a kind of bureaucratic nightmare. And there are quite a lot of countries and companies that are simply no longer willing to provide courier services or packaging services to the United States 'cause it's just too complicated to do the administration of the tariffs.</p><p>GROSS: Now, it's not even clear if these tariffs are legal, because it's Congress' power to inflict tariffs. It's not the president's power. But the president is using a provision of a federal law that addresses trade issues. This is trade issues that present a threat to national security. And this part of the federal law doesn't even mention the word tariff. So the Supreme Court is scheduled to rule on the legality of these tariffs. And if the Supreme Court rules they're not legal, then what? Do we pay the countries back? I mean, where does that leave us?</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: You're right. The broad tariffs have been put into place under this emergency - so-called emergency...</p><p>GROSS: Economic power of the president.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Yeah. Exactly. And that is being challenged, and it's going all the way to the Supreme Court. And I don't think it's at all clear which way the Supreme Court will rule. And we've developed, my colleagues, a SCOTUS bot, which is an AI spot that on the basis of the justices' previous writings and so forth, predicts what the outcome is. And I believe our SCOTUS bot suggests that it isn't going to be struck down.</p><p>If it is struck down, there are other laws under which the administration can impose tariffs, Section 301, Section 201 laws, which are narrower but do give the administration the ability to impose tariffs. And I think that the U.S. trade representative and his staff have been working very hard to figure out the sort plan B route to imposing tariffs. So unfortunately, I think this administration is going to find a way to continue to use tariffs, even if this sweeping ability is removed by the Supreme Court. But yes, you're right that technically, if that is the case, then they would have to technically pay back the tariffs that have been collected under that ruling.</p><p>GROSS: Do you think if there is any hint that they're going to strike it down, that they would do it on an emergency basis? - because if they strike...</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: I don't know.</p><p>GROSS: Yeah.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: I think this is such a central part of this administration's economic policy platform, it would be a big decision for the Supreme Court to rule against the president on that. And thus far, if you look at the behavior of the Supreme Court, it's shown itself disinclined to pick those kind of fights. But I also think that even if it is struck down - as I said, I think there are other ways in which the administration will use tools to continue to impose tariffs.</p><p>It's worth remembering that, you know, President Trump has been in favor of tariffs for 40 years. He first took out ads in The New York Times in the 1980s, railing against Japan - it was Japan in those days that was the object of his ire - and saying that you had to have tariffs. He's a tariff person. He said, I love tariffs. This is central to his presidency. And he campaigned on it, and everyone knew that's what he wanted to. And so I can't imagine that the administration will suddenly go, oh, oh, OK, we can't use tires, right? We're going to - that's not going to be part of our policy any longer.</p><p>GROSS: Let's take another break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of The Economist. We recorded our interview yesterday. We'll be right back. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p><p>GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of The Economist. We're talking about the impact of Trump's tariffs, immigration crackdown and other policies and plans, the impact on everything from consumers to the global economy. We recorded our interview yesterday.</p><p>Let's talk about immigration. So I think you've said that we don't quite appreciate how much Trump's crackdown on immigration is affecting the American economy. Can you elaborate on that?</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Yes, of course. We've spent a lot of time talking about tariffs, and rightly so, because tariffs have been a big part of the discussion over the last six months. But one of the striking things, and I think much less remarked on, is just how dramatic the shift in the numbers of people coming into the U.S. has been.</p><p>Now, we all know that President Trump proudly says that he has, you know, stopped the flood of people coming across the southern border, and he has. But the consequences that - the U.S. has gone from a country that had, under President Biden, net immigration of some 2.5 million people a year to this year having - the estimates are, you know, very, very low hundreds of thousands. Or even some forecasts I've seen have suggested that this year, the U.S. could see a net outflow of people, I E, more people leaving the U.S. than coming into the U.S. And that would be the first time since the Depression that the U.S. would have a net outflow.</p><p>And on the one hand, that is exactly what the president said he was going to do - you know, stop people coming in. But that's a very big shock to the labor market, and to understand the impact of that, I think it's worth separating two things - the stop of low-skilled people, the people broadly coming across the southern border, and the much more unfriendly attitude towards higher-skilled people. And if you remember, just a few weeks ago, the administration suddenly announced that H-1B visas, which are the high-skilled visas, would now - henceforth, companies would have to pay $100,000 to get one of these visas.</p><p>So if we split those two up, low-skilled immigrants coming across the border - you can argue about whether it was a good or bad thing, and I'm not going into that here. But what is certainly true is that there are a large number of industries in the U.S., particularly agriculture and construction, where foreign workers particularly, and many of them there in the U.S. illegally, were a huge part of the workforce. I mean, the estimates suggest it's, I think, you know, as high as 50% in agriculture and 25% in construction. You know, that's a big hit if suddenly the sort of pipeline of those workers is cut off. And because of the aggressive actions of ICE, of the immigration enforcement agency, you know, you are seeing a lot of people very worried and very worried about going to work in those communities. So it's hitting poorer Americans.</p><p>The other impact on - at the top end of the labor market, I think, is a much more medium- to long-term impact. But there are in certain areas - I mean, take AI, for instance. You know, many, many, many of the top researchers in AI in the United States are foreign-born.</p><p>GROSS: Elon Musk...</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: I know that I'm...</p><p>GROSS: ...For heaven's sake.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Yes. Four - in fact, four of the CEOs of the Magnificent Seven that we were talking about - four of them are foreign-born. And so if the U.S. genuinely becomes a place that is less hospitable to foreign-born folk, then I think it has a very big medium- and long-term cost to the United States because, by and large, these people are some of the most productive and most skilled. And they are the people who have come to the U.S. 'cause the strength of the U.S. has been that this is a place which attracts the best and the brightest from around the world, has the biggest and deepest capital markets, and so is a magnet for, you know, smart people, good ideas. And they get them funded there, and that's the engine of U.S. growth.</p><p>And if you suddenly develop a reputation for being a place that doesn't really like foreigners and doesn't want high-skilled foreigners, I think it will really hurt the U.S.' ability to maintain its position as one of the most, you know, innovative and successful economies. There's a study that suggests that something like between 30% and 50% of America's productivity gains between 1990 and 2010 were thanks to skilled immigrants. It's an extraordinarily high share.</p><p>GROSS: Can I ask you...</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: And so if you...</p><p>GROSS: ...A question, though? What is the logic behind President Trump placing a $100,000 fee, you know, for visas on high-skilled workers coming to the U.S.?</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: I think if you asked a member of the administration, it would be these H-1B visas have, for too long, been a way for companies to get cheap skilled workers from abroad, whereas in fact they can and should give those jobs to Americans. And by raising the price of H-1Bs, you know, we're encouraging companies only to apply for those if there is a really high-skilled person that they need from abroad.</p><p>At some level, there is an economic logic that says you should create a market and pay a price for these visas. But I don't actually think that's really what's motivating this. I think that there are a number of people in the administration who are just migration restrictionists and who just don't want foreigners. And it's for that reason that I think it's a dangerous direction to go in.</p><p>And for us in Europe, you know, this is a tremendous opportunity, yet I'm not at all sure that European governments will grab it. But Europe has a huge number of highly skilled people, particularly in areas like AI. And many of these people have been going for years now to the United States because that's where a lot of the opportunities were. Well, if the United States doesn't want high-skilled foreigners any longer, then they are coming back to Europe, which is a huge, you know, influx of talent potentially for Europe.</p><p>GROSS: What about, like, hospitals and doctors? I know from personal experience in - with, you know, family doctors and emergency room visits and, you know, all of that that so many doctors and nurses are foreign-born. And if we cut off that flow, if we make it more difficult for hospitals and other medical practices to have foreign medical workers come to the U.S., we're hurting the health care system. We're hurting people who need doctors and nurses. I mean, there already seems to be a shortage.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Yeah. I think that's absolutely right. And I think that's - you know, that is true in the medical area. It's true in the high-tech area. It's true in lots of areas.</p><p>GROSS: Oh, and I...</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: And that's what's so...</p><p>GROSS: I should also mention caregivers. So...</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Yeah.</p><p>GROSS: ...Many caregivers are...</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Absolutely.</p><p>GROSS: ...Foreign-born.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: And the United States has always been - or at least for most of the past hundred years has been - a country that has been, you know, a magnet for migration. Now, what is certainly true is that under the Biden administration in particular, there was an absolute surge of migration, illegal migration, across the southern border. And it's also true that that caused real political disquiet, I think, frankly, in both parties. I understand that, and I understand that people felt that there was a sort of loss of control of the border. And what the Trump administration is doing is in reaction to that. And the reason it is actually quite popular is because people felt the border was out of control. So I absolutely understand why a country needs to be able to secure its borders.</p><p>But we are now, it looks like, going from a world of extremely high levels of migration to what looks to be zero or possibly negative. And my worry is if that is sustained for any number of years, particularly in high skilled migration, but frankly, also in less skilled migration because you need farm workers, you need construction workers, you need - the U.S. needs people for its economy to grow, I think it will really hurt the U.S. economy.</p><p>GROSS: OK, I've got to reintroduce you again. We have to take a break.</p><p>If you're just joining us, my guest is Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of The Economist. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF CAKE SONG, "TOUGHTER THAN IT IS")</p><p>GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of The Economist. We're talking about the impact of Trump's tariffs, immigration crackdown and other policies and plans on everything from consumers to the global economy. We recorded our interview yesterday.</p><p>Let's get back to AI. The frenzy around AI is driving up the stock market. But what impact do you think AI is going to have on the larger economy since so many jobs are already being replaced by AI?</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Well, let's stand back. Artificial intelligence is, I think, going to prove to be the biggest transformational technology since the Industrial Revolution. I do think this is a sort of epochal change over the next few years in the way our economies are run and in the capacity that artificial intelligence brings and the potential disruption. So I think this is a big, big deal. I don't think it's a question of the next year or two. It'll be, you know, probably decades until we see the full effect. What we're seeing in the stock market is a kind of collective realization by investors that this could indeed be a big, big thing and then a massive frenzy, a sort of gold rush, if you will, of piling into the companies that investors think are going to be the winner. So take Nvidia, for example, which is the chip company, its share price has absolutely gone through the roof because it is essentially part of this gold rush. But the impact on the broader economy depends on the time frame you're looking at. What I think it will do will improve the productivity of the economy. It'll make us, as a society, much more productive. There'll be lots of ways in which our lives will be transformed for the better, but it is going to be very disruptive.</p><p>And I think as there have been in previous bouts of technological innovation, there are definitely going to be losers from this. And I guess what worries me a bit, particularly given the political environment we're in right now, is that we don't have the political capacity to deal with the consequences of that kind of disruption on ordinary workers. 'Cause if you look back, Terry, at the whole era of the sort of, you know, '90s and 2000s after NAFTA and after those trade deals and jobs moved, jobs were displaced thanks to trade, you know, that was really the origin of a lot of the polarization and anger in many parts of the United States. And if you imagine that the impact on jobs from AI could be even bigger than that and faster than that, you can imagine that it's going to be politically very, very difficult to deal with. So that's the sort of worrying scenario.</p><p>On the other hand, it could also be technology that really allows the U.S. economy to grow much faster and to have, you know, a kind of prosperity that it hasn't had for a long time or indeed ever. And so, it's just we're at the very beginning stages of this, and what the stock market is doing is essentially, you know, encapsulating all of the hopes around the technology. But at the same time, as you point out, it could have all kinds of impacts for real people in the real economy, which are much more negative.</p><p>GROSS: So there's a debate going on about whether the stock market gains are a bubble, whether the valuation of AI-related stocks are a bubble. If it is a bubble, and the bubble bursts and the stock market crashes, would it be different than previous crashes?</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: The word bubble is one that is bounded around a lot and certainly I use, too, but we have to be a little careful what we mean by bubble. Clearly, these are very richly priced stocks, and it's pretty clear that even if the AI delivers in the most optimistic way possible, not every company is going to do as well as its current stock market price assumes it will do in terms of future revenues. So there will be some losers and there'll be companies that don't fulfill the expectations that are currently priced into their stock prices.</p><p>However, does that mean it is a dangerous and pernicious bubble? You know, in 2007 and 2008, we had a housing bubble, and the bursting of that housing bubble caused the global financial crisis. And the reason that was so catastrophic and painful was because essentially, it was - the ripple effects to banks and the financial system from the collapse of that asset price, the housing prices.</p><p>This time around, it's much less connected to the banking system. And the financial consequences, they're not going to be zero. There's definitely going to be a hit to those people who invested in the stock market who will lose a lot of money. And there will be some knock on consequences to the financial institutions that have lent to these companies or lent to companies that are investing in data centers and so forth. But I think it is likely to be less sort of financially corrosive than the global financial crisis.</p><p>GROSS: Is Trump still interested in investing money from the Federal Reserve in crypto? Is that still a thing?</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: I don't actually know, but what is very clear - that this is an administration that is extremely pro crypto. I'm not as convinced as those in the Trump administration are that this is a sensible direction to really go in. But what's very clear is that crypto is going mainstream for good or ill, and this is a bit of a gold rush. It's one that the president and his family are personally benefiting from to an extraordinary degree. It's more broadly an administration that, you know, has legislatively now underwritten, you know, we want America to be a place where cryptocurrencies blossom and where the whole crypto universe blossoms.</p><p>And actually, this is something that leads - and I will say this very quickly, but this is an administration that from financial services to energy to all manner of areas, is trying to cut regulation and make it easier for business to do things. And I think that's an important thing to remember because it's - you know, CEOs in the United States are very upbeat right now, and they're certainly not saying anything publicly against the president, perhaps because they're worried. But they are also seeing an administration that is trying to, you know, make it easier to invest in the United States and is trying to make it easier for businesses to do well.</p><p>So I do think it's kind of important that we don't focus only on one side of the ledger. It's not that the Trump administration is only doing things that are hurting the economy. It is also trying to do things that encourage investment, that encourage businesses to invest. In financial services, they're definitely pushing back against regulation. That may or may not be a good idea, but broadly, I think most people agree that there was too much and too onerous regulation in the Biden administration and having a bit less of it would be a good thing.</p><p>GROSS: But also, just one thing in terms of encouraging business, not the alternative energy world. Those companies are not being encouraged by the Trump administration.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Absolutely. You're absolutely right. If you stand back a bit, what is really striking is how willing this administration is to pick winners and to say, you know, this is a good company, it's a bad company, you know, essentially the government taking a stake in Intel. These are kind of remarkable things for a, you know, notionally Republican administration to be doing. It's essentially intervening in business in a very, very sort of heavy-handed and overt way. You know, calling out CEOs when they're not doing what the president wants. Punishing those who have an agenda that he doesn't like.</p><p>You know, look, I'm still a, you know, free marketeer. I'm still a good English liberal who believes in a limited state and is skeptical of untrammeled power and authority, but I'm really struck that, you know, the U.S. now almost seems to be sort of normalized, this kind of behavior by the government. And it's, to me, very un-American.</p><p>GROSS: My guest is Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of The Economist. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p><p>GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of The Economist. We're talking about the impact of Trump's tariffs, immigration crackdown and other policies and plans on everything from consumers to the global economy. We recorded our interview yesterday.</p><p>So after slashing so many federal positions and, you know, Trump is cutting back on spending, meanwhile, Trump wants to bail out Argentina to the tune of $20 billion. And that's only if the current president, Javier Milei, gets reelected in the October 26 election, 'cause Milei is an ally of Trump's. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has advocating (ph) for raising the American contribution of $20 billion to as high as $40 billion. What does this bailout mean? I'm unclear about whether we'd be giving them the billions, loaning them the billions or investing the billions in the Argentine peso.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: The U.S. is essentially trying to provide enough financial muscle to shore up confidence in Argentina and in President Milei. I actually think that what President Milei has done in Argentina is pretty impressive, and it's been a pretty remarkable turnaround in a country that has, you know, for decades, failed to get to grips with its fiscal problem. Basically, there's an election coming up. There's a lot of fear that he will lose in that parliamentary election and thus be unable to continue his reform program. And so the investors are nervous about Argentina.</p><p>And what the U.S. Treasury has essentially done is to try and sort of provide, with its U.S. dollar lifeline, the confidence that prevents a run on the peso. Now, the peso needs to float the currency, and it's not sort of, in principle, crazy that the U.S. should provide a sort of underpinning of support. It's exactly what the International Monetary Fund was set up to do for countries. What's interesting is that this is done with such a sort of clear political condition, you know, as I think President Trump said pretty explicitly, you know, we're going to pull the plug if he doesn't win. So it's one country, rather than the International Monetary Fund has for decades supported Argentina.</p><p>The U.S. is now coming in with its own sort of bilateral support plan, but very clearly, as you say, for a political ally. It's an odd thing for the U.S. to do, given that just, you know, earlier this year, there was - it's pulled back from all manner of, you know, USAID and foreign assistance of all sorts. So it's showing that, you know, the United States under the Trump administration is indeed willing to support countries if they are countries where it particularly likes the leadership.</p><p>GROSS: Looking at the larger picture in the U.S. right now and in the economy, not knowing what the future brings, what do you see as the best- and worst-case scenarios when you try to look ahead? Is that a manner of a question to...</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: OK, let me...</p><p>GROSS: Yeah.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Let me give you the best case. The best case is that the damage from the tariffs is limited, modest corrosion of U.S. competitiveness, nothing too terrible, that the damage from immigration is such that they don't go full restrictionist, but they do continue to make America be a place that welcomes particularly the highly skilled and that the AI revolution is both an elixir for the economy but not so sudden that it causes extraordinary disruptions in the job market. If all of those things go well, then the United States, I think, will remain the most dynamic economy in the world, and it will be able to essentially absorb the - some - these shocks if they're not too big.</p><p>And, you know, I've learned in - gosh - almost 30 years about writing about the U.S. economy that you bet against it at your peril. And there are far more times that I have written pieces saying the U.S. is heading for a terrible period and been wrong than the converse. So I'm generally an optimist about the U.S. So my upbeat case would be this is a huge country full of very incredibly hardworking, smart people, a magnet for talent from around the world. It's clearly ahead in AI. It has all of the ingredients for being an extremely prosperous country that can also deal with its very real challenges. And one we've hardly talked about, but the budget deficit and the debt problem are all dealable (ph) with if you have economic growth and rational policymakers. Now, I'm not sure how much faith I put in that, but that's my upbeat scenario.</p><p>The negative one, you know, it depends how dark you want me to get. You know, I think that if you have continued protectionism, high tariffs, continued immigration restriction, a growing overvaluation in the stock market, which is ever more reliant on a frenzy in a few Big Tech companies, an administration that wants to punish its critics, that wants to use the tools of economic policy to punish its critics, whether it is to push around the Fed or whether it is to go after companies that it doesn't like, then you are systematically, I think, undermining the pillars that have made the American economy strong. And, you know, things could unravel quite quickly.</p><p>And, you know, things like - the U.S. right now, because it has the dollar, the world's reserve currency, because it's the biggest, strongest economy in the world, I think there is a kind of presumption often in the U.S. that it must always be this way. And that's not necessarily the case. Foreigners could take fright. They could leave dollar assets. The dollar could tumble further, interest rates could rise. The U.S. could suddenly become much less productive and a much tougher place and a much worse place for ordinary American workers who have already had - many of whom have already had quite a tough time. So you can paint a pretty grim picture if you put your mind to it.</p><p>GROSS: Well, it sounds like you didn't have to work that hard (laughter) to paint that grim...</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: It's fine.</p><p>GROSS: ...Picture.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: I really want to - I don't think that has to happen. I'm not only, by nature, an optimist, I do think the resilience of the U.S. economy is remarkable. I also think that, in the end, this administration will not want to preside over the destruction of the American economy. And so in areas where it sees that happening, it will actually reverse course.</p><p>GROSS: Well, Zanny Minton Beddoes, thank you so much for returning to our show.

<p><em>Good morning.

Vance says the deal is continuing to progress despite the fighting between Israel and Hamas over the weekend. The vice president, along with several other U.S. officials in Israel, is working to get the two sides to take the next steps under the deal.</p>
<ul class="edTag"><li>🎧<strong> The next phase of the ceasefire poses challenges as Gaza doesn't have a government</strong>, and it isn't clear when it will have one, NPR's Greg Myre tells <em>Up First</em>. Vance says other things, like getting the people of Gaza food, medicine and security, should happen first. Other big issues that need to be addressed are the next phase's calls for Hamas to disarm, Israeli troops to pull back and international troops to take their place in Gaza as a stabilization force. To work on these priorities, U.S. troops built a civilian-military coordination center outside of Gaza for officials from the U.S. and other countries, as well as other organizations working in Gaza, so that they can synchronize efforts.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries believes that public pressure will intensify on Republicans in the coming days</strong> to extend health insurance subsidies, which are a key sticking point in the shutdown fight. The federal government remains shut down after the Senate failed to pass a spending bill again on Monday. Congressional leaders continue to avoid negotiating an end to the shutdown. The White House has attempted to end the standoff between the two sides by threatening Democrats with more cuts to spending and the workforce. <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>🎧<strong> President Trump has praised Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought for cutting "Democrat priorities"</strong> that the party will not get back. The president has repeatedly referred to "Democrat programs," but NPR's Stephen Fowler says there are no such things, because the federal employees who process Social Security payments and handle taxes work in a nonpartisan manner. Vought has announced plans to cancel grants for energy projects in Democratic-led cities and states and other efforts to make Democrats feel the fiscal impact. The off-year elections are on Nov. 4, and they could reflect voter discontent with Republican governance, including the shutdown, Fowler says.</li></ul> <p><strong>Images of an excavator demolishing the facade of the East Wing of the White House went viral this week.</strong> The construction marks the groundbreaking for the president's $250 million ballroom project. Trump has wanted to build the ballroom for more than a decade, but not everyone is pleased with the developments, and historic preservation groups are expressing concerns. <br/></p>
<ul class="edTag"><li>🎧 <strong>The demolition has taken many people by surprise because Trump downplayed the impacts</strong> when he announced the project in July, says NPR's Tamara Keith. The National Capital Planning Commission would typically have a role in approving a project like this, but it is currently not operating due to the government shutdown. Trump says he is funding some of the ballroom project, and other donors include major corporations with business before the government, Keith says. Google is donating over $20 million to settle a civil suit that Trump filed. Watchdogs say this is one of many reasons the project is an ethical red flag.</li></ul> <h3 class="edTag">Today's listen</h3>

<div class="article-title">Mental exercise can reverse a brain change linked to aging, study finds</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Scientists are reporting the first compelling evidence in people that cognitive training can boost levels of a brain chemical that typically declines with age.</p> <p>A 10-week study of people 65 or older found that doing rigorous mental exercises for 30 minutes a day increased levels of the chemical messenger acetylcholine by 2.3% in a brain area involved in attention and memory.</p>
<p>The increase "is not huge," says Étienne de Villers-Sidani, a neurologist at McGill University in Montreal. "But it's significant, considering that you get a 2.5% decrease per decade normally just with aging."</p> <p>So, at least in this brain area, cognitive training appeared to turn back the clock by about 10 years.</p> <p>The chemical change observed after intensive brain training is persuasive, says Michael Hasselmo, director of the Center for Systems Neuroscience at Boston University, who was not involved in the study.</p> <p>"It was compelling enough that I thought, 'Maybe I need to be doing this,'" he says.</p>
<p>The result backs earlier research in animals showing that environments that stimulate the brain can increase levels of certain neurotransmitters. Studies of people have suggested that cognitive training can improve thinking and memory.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Never skip brain day </h3> <p>The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, comes amid a proliferation of online brain-training programs, including Lumosity, Elevate, Peak, CogniFit and BrainHQ.</p> <p>But it has been hard to know whether these programs really work, says de Villers-Sidani, who directs the cognitive disorders clinic at McGill's Montreal Neurological Institute.</p> <p>"They had a positive impact on some cognitive measures," he says, "but then the question was, how much is it changing the brain and how is it changing the brain?"</p> <p>So de Villers-Sidani and a team of researchers decided to see whether mental exercise could increase levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that's closely associated with cognitive performance.</p> <p>Acetylcholine levels typically begin a gradual decline around middle age. The levels drop sharply, though, in people with Alzheimer's disease.</p> <p>The team studied 92 healthy people who were 65 or older.</p>
<p>Half the participants spent 30 minutes a day playing computer games like solitaire and Candy Crush.</p> <p>The others spent the same amount of time each day doing cognitive exercises that are part of the scientifically tested program BrainHQ. The program challenges users to remember the type and location of items that appear and disappear with increasing speed.</p> <p>"It's really targeted at attention and speed of processing, and it kind of pushes you to the limit," de Villers-Sidani says.</p> <p>The researchers used a special kind of PET scan to detect changes in acetylcholine levels in the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region that's important for making decisions and detecting errors.</p>
<p>"I was not sure we would find anything, to be honest," de Villers-Sidani says.</p>
<p>But they did. In people who played games like solitaire, acetylcholine levels were unchanged. But in people who did cognitive training, there was a significant increase.</p> <p>Acetylcholine levels also increased in other brain areas, including the hippocampus, which plays a key role in memory.</p> <p>Even modest changes are meaningful, Hasselmo says, because acetylcholine does more than carry messages in the brain. It also modulates the behavior of neurons in ways that affect learning, memory and attention.</p> <p>So when a person takes, say, a high dose of the motion sickness drug scopolamine — which blocks the effects of acetylcholine — things start to go awry.</p> <p>"If you block the neuromodulator function in the brain, a person can't even think," Hasselmo says. "You go into a delirious state."</p> <p>On the other hand, even small increases in acetylcholine can have a "profound and notable effect" on memory and thinking in older people.</p> <p>Hasselmo notes that the earliest Alzheimer's drugs reduced symptoms by increasing levels of acetylcholine. Now, he says, intensive brain training has the potential to achieve similar gains and stave off cognitive decline.</p>

<div class="article-title">The federal government is still shut down. Here's what that means across the country</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>It's Day 22 of the federal government shutdown, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to an agreement to end it.</p> <p>Without a fix, many federal employees will not be getting paid this Friday, the first full paycheck they'll miss as a result of the shutdown. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has tried to cast doubt on that.</p> <p>Meanwhile, President Trump has tied the shutdown to his overall goal of shrinking the size of the government, laying off workers en masse while it continues — and promising more — while specifically targeting what he calls "Democrat programs." </p>
<p><em>Read the latest on a case brought by some fired federal workers to pause the latest wave of shutdown layoffs.</em></p> <p>As the shutdown drags on, here's the latest on what we know.</p> <p><em>Jump to state-specific impacts.</em></p> <p><strong>Why did the federal government shut down?</strong> </p> <p>A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.  </p> <p>Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the heath care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.</p> <p>Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer. </p> <p>NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock. That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when most states will send notices to subscribers laying out the cost of coverage without subsidies.</p>
<p> In Vermont, where notices started going out on Oct. 15, for example, some families are facing increases of $25,000, according to Sen.

That includes nearly 42 million who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. Their debit-like cards were funded a month in advance through October, but the Trump administration has warned the program will run out of money Nov. 1. In a letter dated Oct. 10, the USDA told state agencies to hold off distributing November benefits "until further notice" because of insufficient funds. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has called on the agency to shift money from its contingency fund and other places to keep SNAP at least partially funded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) — which helps 7 million mothers and young children — was initially slated to lose funding after only a couple weeks. The Trump administration shifted $300 million in tariff revenue to keep it afloat, but the National WIC Association says that emergency funding will only last through October. It's calling for an additional $300 million to keep WIC operating for a couple more weeks. Some states could step in to help fill the gap, depending on their resources.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Jennifer Ludden</em><em>, NPR</em></p> <p><strong>And what about school lunches?</strong></p> <p>Some state agencies say they may not have the funds to reimburse schools providing free and low-cost meals.</p> <p>Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, says some agencies have told her organization they don't have the money to pay schools back for meals during the shutdown.</p> <p>"There is a strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to make sure that kids have access to healthy meals at school, so we are hopeful that the administration and Congress will act before this becomes an issue."</p> <p>According to Pratt-Heavner, USDA released funds to regional offices for meals served in October. But some states report they have yet to receive any money, she said. Before the shutdown, USDA released a contingency plan outlining funds states could tap into to cover any gaps. A USDA spokesman did not directly answer NPR when asked if the agency would advance funding to state agencies should the shutdown persist. </p> <p>— <em>Kadin Mills,</em><em> NPR</em></p>
<p><strong>USPS is 'open for business as usual'</strong></p> <p>"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown," according to a statement by USPS. The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.</p> <p><strong>IRS furloughs nearly half its staff</strong></p> <p>A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.</p>
<p>The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data. </p> <p><em>— </em><em>Scott Horsley</em><em>, </em>Andrea Hsu and Stephen Fowler, <em>NPR</em></p> <p><strong>National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees</strong></p> <p>On Monday, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines. </p> <p>According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the "Democrat shutdown." </p> <p>Around 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Geoff Brumfiel</em><em>, NPR</em></p> <p>In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open.</p> <p><strong>Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might</strong></p> <p>Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans. </p> <p>At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department. </p> <p>This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. According to multiple sources, the special education office is now left with just a handful of top executives and support staff. </p>
<p>In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Shannon Bond</em><em> and </em><em>Cory Turner</em><em>, NPR</em></p> <p>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October.

<p><strong>National Parks are a mixed bag</strong></p> <p>Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt. That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.</p> <p>As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails "will generally remain accessible to visitors" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.</p> <p>Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.</p> <p><strong>Salem will be open through Halloween thanks to community support</strong></p> <p> WBUR's Andrea Shea reports that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open. </p> <p>Shea reports that NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2.</p>
<p><strong>Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue</strong></p> <p>Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue. </p> <p>But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits. </p> <p>In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters.</p> <p>As NPR's Scott Horsley reports some furloughed employees at the Labor Department are coming back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. "We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work," McLaughlin said.</p> <p>According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown.</p> <p>"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period," Noem posted on X last week. "By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a "super check" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period."</p>

<div class="article-title">Mamdani's rise in NYC reflects a generational fight within the Democratic Party</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>When state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo faced off in the first New York City mayoral debate of the general election, the generational battle within the Democratic Party was on full display.</p> <p>Cuomo was long a member of Democratic royalty, leading New York as governor for nearly 11 years after serving in the Clinton administration.  His late father, Gov. Mario Cuomo, was a Democratic Party icon. </p> <p>Again and again, Cuomo hammered the idea that his deep resume makes him uniquely qualified to lead America's biggest city.</p> <p>"This is no job for on-the-job training," Cuomo said during the Oct. 16 exchange, painting Mamdani as a political novice with left-leaning ideas outside the mainstream. "He never has had a job. On his resume it said he interned for his mother. This is not a job for a first-timer."</p>
<p>But Cuomo is running in this race as an independent after Mamdani, who turned 34 last weekend, trounced him during the Democratic Party primary. Mamdani was an unknown outside his state Assembly district until this year, but has led consistently in the general election by double-digit margins, according to polls.</p> <p>"What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity," Mamdani said during the debate. "And what you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience."</p>
<p>That barb pointed to the downside of Cuomo's long track record in office: It comes with some gritty political baggage, including a sexual misconduct scandal that led Cuomo to resign as governor in 2021. </p> <p>Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing. But Andres Bernal, a political analyst who lectures at the City University of New York, thinks many young voters look at Cuomo's history of controversy and are reminded of the Democratic Party establishment that has left them disillusioned.  </p> <p>"It's a revolving door with a lot of corporate America, a lot of funders and lobbyists," he said.</p> <p>Bernal says Mamdani overcame Cuomo's attacks over his relatively thin resume by offering big progressive ideas, like freezing apartment rents and offering free city bus service, that appeal to many young voters.  </p>
<p>"Be ambitious and look for fundamental changes that I think inspire a lot of people and I think are associated with Mamdani's youth," Bernal said.</p> <p>It seems to be working. The latest poll by AARP and Gotham Polling shows over half of Mamdani's support comes from young New Yorkers, under age 50. For Cuomo, meanwhile, 76% of his support is over age 50. </p> <p>But it's not only serious policy issues that set these men apart. It's also lived experience and style. When asked during the debate whether they've bought marijuana in New York City's legal cannabis shops, Mamdani laughed and said yes.  Cuomo offered a terse no. </p> <p>Their starkly different tones have played out in social media, where Cuomo offered conventional campaign ads, often attacking Mamdani. Mamdani's campaign, meanwhile, posts upbeat, often funny and hopeful videos that regularly go viral.  </p>
<p>"Zohran Mamdani is right now the epitome of what you're going to see every other candidate trying to do," said J.C. Polanco, a political analyst and professor at the University of Mount St. Vincent in the Bronx. </p> <p>Polanco is critical of many of Mamdani's left-leaning policy ideas. But he says Mamdani's use of social media to reach young voters is a game changer, allowing him to overcome his relative lack of experience.</p> <p>"He has rewritten the book. I love his style; he's a happy warrior," he said.</p> <p>During last week's debate, Cuomo said his campaign's social media messaging has gotten better since he lost the Democratic primary, but he acknowledged playing catch-up.  "I did not do enough on social media, which is a very effective medium now," he said.  </p> <p>While Cuomo and Mamdani have sparred, often bitterly, across this generational party divide, the Republican in the race, Curtis Sliwa, has suggested they're closer on policy issues than their campaign rhetoric suggests. "We have the architect and the apprentice," Sliwa said during the debate.</p>
<p>Early voting is now underway. If Mamdani holds onto his lead through Election Day on Nov. 4, he will represent one more big generational change, serving as the first Muslim mayor in a city that's home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel.</p> <p>Cuomo has attacked Mamdani repeatedly for criticizing Israel, but that hasn't appeared to slow Mamdani's momentum. Mamdani has picked up some key endorsements from  Jewish leaders in the city and a New York Times-Siena poll last month found most young voters in New York City sympathize more with the Palestinians than with Israel over the war in Gaza.</p>
