<div class="article-title">Trump drives the shutdown coverage, but leaderless Democrats have broken through with healthcare message</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Spoiler alert: I’m about to tell you how the government shutdown ends.</p><p>Bill Clinton held the record, at 21 days, but Donald Trump easily beat that with 35 days in his first term.</p><p>Barack Obama weighed in with a mere 16-day shuttering of the government.</p><p>So I’ve lived through enough of these things to know the pattern as we pass the one-week mark today.</p><p>President Trump has a huge advantage with his giant megaphone. But isn’t it fascinating that, until yesterday, he hadn’t spoken to reporters since the government went to what must be called a partial shutdown? He doesn’t want to own this if it turns unpopular. So he’s happy to let Mike Johnson and John Thune spar with Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer while he stays above the fray.</p><p>But there’s a twist this time. Republicans are suddenly rushing to defend federal programs. </p><p>The speaker told Fox News Digital he is concerned about the Special Nutrition Program for Women, Children and Infants (WIC), as well as FEMA grants.</p><p>"You have FEMA – I mean, I'm from a hurricane state. We're in the middle of hurricane season. I’ve got two of them off the coast of the U.S. right now."</p><p>He’s also concerned about a lapse in the federal flood insurance program. And Johnson expressed concern about the troops serving without pay.</p><p>On the Fox and CNN weekend shows, Johnson said he doesn’t want telehealth and mental health to be halted. "That’s what Chuck Schumer is holding hostage."</p><p>I suppose it would be unsporting of me to point out the hypocrisy here. This is the Republicans’ own budget we’re talking about, reflecting Trump’s priorities. But the Democrats play the same game when they hold the White House. Nobody has clean hands here.</p><p>Surprisingly, given their usual distaste for the federal bureaucracy, the Dems have broken through the static with their message of fighting for health care, Marjorie Taylor Greene, breaking with Trump yet again, has joined them: </p><p>"I’m absolutely disgusted that health insurance premiums will DOUBLE if the tax credits expire this year."</p><p>Greene called Obamacare BS and the insurance industry a "scam." But as she noted, the expiration of the subsidies means premiums will soar.</p><p>"I’m going to go against everyone on this issue because when the tax credits expire this year my own adult children’s insurance premiums for 2026 are going to DOUBLE, along with all the wonderful families and hard-working people in my district," she posted on X.</p><p>The Republicans say, gosh, all we’re asking for is a seven-week kick-the-can delay that would end this shutdown. The Democrats, the party of government, will counter with a shorter delay, maybe three or four weeks, congratulate themselves on being fighters, and extract a commitment that they’ll be consulted on extending the Obamacare tax credits to avoid kicking millions off the rolls. And that ends the shutdown.</p><p>Then the Republicans will do whatever they want.</p><p>Except they can’t. They’re unable to get to 60 votes without some Democratic defections.  </p><p>Unless… hmmm… Trump and his party go nuclear. </p><p>He could declare one of his national emergencies and declare that he has the unilateral authority to change the budget however he likes.</p><p>Harry Reid, as Democratic leader, was the first to go partially nuclear by saying the normal rules would no longer apply to most judicial nominations. </p><p>Trump did talk to reporters yesterday at a bilat with Canada’s Mark Carney, saying the Democrats are "the ones who started it, and it’s almost like a kamikaze attack by them."</p><p>Schumer’s reputation has sunk so low that Jon Stewart called the minority leader "a human flat tire." </p><p>Axios reports on a draft White House memo saying furloughed workers aren’t guaranteed compensation for their forced time off. That’s a pressure tactic against the Democrats to end the shutdown by denying back pay to as many as 750,000 workers. </p><p>It will also never happen. The backlash would be fierce. So it’s telling that it leaked. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Treasury, which like every other department carries out Trump’s will, attempted to justify a study of a $1 coin emblazoned with his visage.</p><p>Secretary Scott Bessent said he was using his authority to issue coins "with designs emblematic of the United States semiquincentennial," or 250th birthday. </p><p>Small problem, aside from the tackiness: An 1866 law requires that anyone pictured on U.S. currency must be deceased.</p><p>Trump has shattered every norm in today’s society. You think he’s going to let an 1866 law stop him? It’s not exactly the Posse Comitatus Act.</p><p>Everyone hates government in the abstract, but especially with a shortage of air controllers slowing up traffic, the pain level will keep increasing. And a couple of reports say that while the president is openly cutting programs that benefit blue states and cities, this is, perhaps inevitably, starting to hurt red states as well. </p><p>Now you have the strange situation of both parties embracing federal spending, which is usually a big fat target for the GOP. Things look different when you’re defending your state, your district, your backyard.</p><p>So now that I’ve spoiled the suspense, you can go back to being nervous. It’s a perfect storm that, for all the partisan finger-pointing, has weirdly brought the parties together.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Aaron Judge's clutch home run leads Yankees to historic comeback in must-win Game 3 over Blue Jays</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The New York Yankees are not done yet. They rallied from a 6-1 deficit for their largest comeback win in an elimination game in franchise history, taking Game 3 of the ALDS against the Toronto Blue Jays.</p><p>The Yankees scored eight unanswered runs in the middle innings to secure a 9-6 victory. They'll now turn to rookie Cam Schlittler – whose first postseason start was a masterpiece in the Wild Card Series win over the Boston Red Sox – as they face elimination again Wednesday night. </p><p>Meanwhile, Blue Jays manager John Schneider will likely rely on a bullpen game to try to cool off a suddenly red-hot Yankees lineup. </p><p>After being outscored 23-8 in the first two games, the Yankees needed to strike early. But the Yankee Stadium crowd was silenced almost immediately by another Vladimir Guerrero Jr. home run.</p><p>The red-hot slugger hammered a Carlos Rodón changeup over the left-center-field fence to make it 2-0 right away for Toronto. The Yankees responded with a Giancarlo Stanton two-out single in the bottom of the first inning, but the Blue Jays took the wind out of any Yankees sails in the top of the third.</p><p>Toronto put up a four-spot as a slew of RBI singles from Daulton Varsho, Ernie Clement and Anthony Santander made it a 6-1 game and knocked Rodón out, much like Max Fried in Game 2 when he couldn’t go more than three innings.</p><p>But the Yankees continued to hang around and responded as Aaron Judge hit an RBI double in the bottom half of the third, while Stanton came through again with a sacrifice fly to score Cody Bellinger and make it a 6-3 game.</p><p>The Blue Jays still owned a solid lead after three innings, but the Yankees were simply looking for that one break and one moment that could potentially turn everything around in this series. That’s what they got when what seemed to be an easy pop-up by Austin Wells turned into a crucial error by Addison Barger in short left field. </p><p>With Wells on second base and Trent Grisham walking, Judge came to the plate with a chance to tie the game with one swing. Judge has been critiqued heavily for his postseason career, and though he has a playoff-high total of hits thus far, he hasn’t done what he does best — hit the ball out of the ballpark.</p><p>If there was ever a time for another signature Judge moment, this was it — against Louis Varland, the Blue Jays’ high-leverage reliever who has given up two long balls to No. 99 in his career.</p><p>With a two-strike count, Judge swung at a 99.7 mph fastball well off the plate inside and roped it down the left-field line. It banged off the foul pole for a three-run home run to tie the game at six, and the Yankee faithful awoke with a collective roar.</p><p>Of course, the Yankees knew the game was only tied and they needed more runs to keep their season alive. In the bottom of the fifth, Jazz Chisholm Jr. knew he got all of a Varland fastball when he hammered it to the second deck in right field for the team’s first lead of the series. Wells added some insurance with an RBI single to make it 8-6.</p><p>The Yankees, now holding a 9-6 lead thanks to a Ben Rice sacrifice fly in the bottom of the sixth, needed nine outs from their top two bullpen arms, Devin Williams and David Bednar, to move on to Game 4. Williams came through with four outs, including two strikeouts, while Bednar provided the final five outs without allowing a hit.</p><p>New York also wouldn’t have been in position to win this game if it weren’t for Fernando Cruz, Camilo Doval and Tim Hill shutting down the Blue Jays’ offense while the Yankees chipped away at the deficit.</p><p>Game 4 will be an 8:08 p.m. ET first pitch at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday night. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Arizona Cardinals have reportedly fined head coach Jonathan Gannon $100,000 for his sideline altercation with running back Emari Demercado. </p><p>Gannon was upset after Demercado dropped the football before crossing the goal line on what should have been a 72-yard touchdown that would have put Arizona up 28-6 early in the fourth quarter. </p><p>Instead, the Cardinals went on to lose to the Tennessee Titans, 22-21. </p><p>A video posted to social media showed Gannon approaching Demercado, who was being consoled by left tackle Paris Johnson after the mistake, and confronting him. Gannon appeared to get in Demercado’s face before making brief contact with the running back's arm as he walked away. </p><p>Gannon apologized for his actions on Monday, saying, "I kind of let the moment get the better of me there." </p><p>There will be no other discipline for Gannon than the fine, according to ESPN. </p><p>This is the first time an NFL head coach has been fined for a player altercation since Bruce Arians, who was coaching the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was disciplined for hitting safety Andrew Adams’ helmet during a Wild Card Round game against the Philadelphia Eagles. The Bucs docked Arians $50,000 for the incident. </p><p>Demercado’s blunder allowed the Titans to get back into the game, as rookie Cam Ward orchestrated a touchdown drive to cut the deficit. </p><p>Demercado wasn’t the only Cardinals to falter. Several defenders failed to recover a red-zone fumble following an interception, allowing Tennessee’s Tyler Lockett to fall on the ball in the end zone for a wild touchdown. </p><p>After the Cardinals failed to pick up the first down, Ward led the Titans on a final drive capped by a walk-off field goal as time expired. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Country singer Zach Bryan released a statement on Tuesday insisting that he did not intend his new song to cause controversy after it went viral over the past few days.</p><p>On his Instagram account, Bryan previewed a new song titled "Bad News" that appeared to lament the policies and general spirit of America under President Donald Trump. </p><p>The song included lyrics such as, "My friends are all degenerates, but they’re all I got, the generational story of dropping the plot. I heard the cops came, Cocky motherf-----s, ain’t they?" and, "And ICE is gonna come bust down your door, try to build a house no one builds no more, but I got a telephone, Kids are all scared and all alone."</p><p>The song continued, "The bar stopped bumping, the rock stopped rolling, the middle fingers rising, and it won’t stop showing. Got some bad news. The fading of the red, white, and blue."</p><p>In a statement posted on an Instagram Story, Bryan wrote that "Bad News" was written months ago and that people need the "full context" of the song.</p><p>"This shows you how divisive a narrative can be when shoved down our throats through social media," Bryan said. "This song is about how much I love this country and everyone in it more than anything. When you hear the rest of the song, you will understand the full context that hits on both sides of the aisle. Everyone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are. We need to find our way back."</p><p>He continued, "I served this country, I love this country and the song itself is about all of us coming out of this divided space. I wasn’t speaking as a politician or some greater-than-thou a--hole, just a 29-year-old man who is just as confused as everyone else. To see how much s--- it stirred up makes me not only embarrassed but kind of scared. Left wing or right wing we’re all one bird and American. To be clear I’m on neither of these radical sides. To all those disappointed in me on either side of whatever you believe in just know I’m trying my best too and we all say things that are misconstrued sometimes."</p><p>Hours later, he posted an additional statement expressing heartbreak over being scrutinized for the last few months.</p><p>"The last few months of my life I’ve been scrutinized by more people than I ever thought possible. I feel like I’ve tried my hardest in so many ways and it’s so had to see where my bearings even are anymore. Been falling off a cliff while trying to grow wings at the same time," Bryan wrote. "I am SO proud to have served in a country where we can all speak freely and converse amongst each other without getting doxxed or accosted on the internet or worse; the violence and heartbreak we’ve faced in the last few months!

"This was her life until she got injured, so she’s just going to give it everything she has.

"He's doing a movie, he's doing a show, he's been traveling so much. He'll be here next week, but we're juggling."</p><p>"We had a certain plan to be in New York right now and then all of a sudden the universe opened and I was offered this incredible experience.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell roasted CNN’s Jake Tapper on Monday in a rare instance of mainstream anchors shooting inside the tent. </p><p>Tapper on Sunday touted an "exclusive interview with President Donald Trump" that was conducted through text messaging. CNN’s "State of the Union" anchor asked Trump about Hamas’ response to his ceasefire proposal, if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on board and the government shutdown, but O’Donnell suggested Tapper was either duped by White House staffers or simply conducted lazy journalism. </p><p>"CNN presented a so-called interview… that they can’t even prove was Donald Trump. They called it ‘breaking news,’ they called it ‘an exclusive, new interview with President Trump.’ That’s what they called it, before the interviewer said this," O’Donnell said before playing video of Tapper saying Trump answered his questions via "text."</p><p>"What? You gave him the questions in writing? So now, instead of letting Trump hide behind a phone call, where we can at least know that it’s him talking, Donald Trump gets to hide behind the black screen of texting? We actually have no idea who texted the replies in that so-called interview," O’Donnell said. </p><p>The MSNBC host said "CNN is unable to prove" it was actually Trump responding. </p><p>"CNN has not revealed how long it took to get a reply to each of the five written questions that apparently got replies from someone," O’Donnell said.</p><p>O’Donnell continued to belittle Tapper, suggesting "slow-pitch softball" questions were lobbed at the president. The MSNBC host was particularly bothered when Tapper asked, "How do you think the government shutdown is going to end?"</p><p>O’Donnell said Tapper received the "empty answer" he "deserved," and scolded his liberal media peer for not revealing which questions Trump failed to respond to. </p><p>"What could be more relevant in reporting an exchange than that is supposed to be with the President of the United States, then, including the questions he refused to answer? We have no idea," O’Donnell said.</p><p>O'Donnell suggested  Trump is suffering from mental decline and accused Tapper of helping out the White House communications staff.</p><p>"When the history of Donald Trump’s mental decline is written, it will no doubt include that so-called interview yesterday as a turning point in Donald Trump’s White House dealing with the challenge of Donald Trump trying to answer questions during this period of obvious mental decline for Donald Trump," O’Donnell said. </p><p>"Donald Trump was allowed to become, by CNN, the first president in history to get questions in writing for an interview, questions that he could take home… and then Donald Trump was allowed to take -- we don’t know how much time to reply to those questions," he continued. "We do know CNN is still waiting for some of them."</p><p>O’Donnell wasn’t finished firing his ire at Tapper and said "this particular interviewer" would be "outraged" if former President Biden had ever answered questions via text message. </p><p>"This particular interviewer wrote an entire book condemning Joe Biden because he didn’t like the way Joe Biden answered questions. He thought Joe Biden wasn’t up to the job of answering questions as a presidential candidate, particularly in the presidential debate," O’Donnell said, referring to Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson's book, "Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again."</p><p>O’Donnell even believes Tapper could have set a dangerous precedent. </p><p>"In the Sunday morning interview business, and it is a business, every time they lower their standards for Donald Trump, that becomes the new standard," O’Donnell said. </p><p>A CNN spokesperson defended Tapper. </p><p>"Jake Tapper is a journalist — CNN journalists will always take any opportunity to ask questions of those in power and share what we learn with our audience," the spokesperson told Fox News Digital. </p><p>Tapper said Tuesday on The Bulwark podcast he casually texted Trump and didn’t expect to be lauded for the "achievement." </p><p>"I would much prefer to be doing an interview with him in person, on-camera, but he has not given me an interview since that one in June 2016," Tapper said. </p><p>Tapper also read the questions that Trump failed to respond to, which included thoughts about Hamas, Obamacare subsidies and whether he would commit to an interview.</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> Federal and local law enforcement officers arrested 14 suspected leaders of the Rancho San Pedro gang Tuesday in Los Angeles, capping a yearslong investigation into what the FBI called one of the most violent street crews in Southern California and a known arm of the Mexican Mafia.</p><p>FBI Director Kash Patel told Fox News Digital the bust marks a turning point in the fight against cartel-linked gangs.</p><p>"The era of cartels operating freely in America is over," Patel said. "Every day, the FBI and our partners are dismantling violent networks at the source, stripping their resources, taking criminals off the streets and saving American lives."</p><p>The FBI's Los Angeles Field Office said agents executed 16 search warrants across San Pedro and nearby communities with help from the LAPD, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the California Department of Justice.</p><p>The case began in Los Angeles and targeted the gang’s leadership, seizing weapons, narcotics and records from homes and meeting spots.</p><p>Investigators said the probe uncovered links between Rancho San Pedro, the Sinaloa Cartel and the 13th Street gang — groups allegedly working together to distribute methamphetamine, fentanyl and heroin throughout Southern California.</p><p>Officials said the takedown hit a gang with roughly 500 members spread across six cliques that pay "taxes" to Mexican Mafia bosses in state prisons.</p><p>"This action will cause a significant setback to Rancho San Pedro and their Mexican Mafia overlords and lead to safer streets for San Pedro residents," said FBI Los Angeles Assistant Director Akil Davis.</p><p>Davis said the arrests dismantled "the command structure" of the gang.</p><p>LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell praised Harbor Division detectives for building the case "step by step."</p><p>The federal complaint charges 13 defendants under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and a 14th as a felon in possession. Prosecutors say the crew trafficked meth, fentanyl, heroin, cocaine and PCP while stockpiling guns to enforce orders.</p><p>Agents also served warrants at affiliated gang locations across the South Bay, as they pursued cartel supply lines tied to the Sinaloa network.</p><p>Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said the case shows "the power of partnerships," and California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the raids "took illegal weapons and dangerous drugs off our streets."</p><p>Rancho San Pedro, founded in the 1970s, mirrors the Mexican Mafia’s prison-based hierarchy and punishes disloyalty with assaults or executions, according to the complaint.</p><p>If convicted, most defendants face life in federal prison. </p><p>All 14 were due in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Tuesday. Officials said more arrests could follow as the investigation continues.</p></body></div></body></html>

Mark Green, who resigned from office in June to take a private sector job.</p><p>Trump's endorsement of Van Epps in a field that also included state Reps. Jody Barrett, Gino Bulso and Lee Reeves, shaped the outcome of the primary battle even though the president's backing came after the finish of early voting in the contest.</p><p>The race among the major GOP contenders turned into a test of loyalty to Trump, and with the president's endorsement, Reeves suspended his campaign and backed Van Epps.</p><p>"Matt knows the WISDOM and COURAGE required to Defend our Country, Support our Incredible Military/Veterans, and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH," Trump said in his endorsement statement.</p><p>Van Epps, who was also endorsed by Green and Republican Gov. Bill Lee, called Trump's support "an incredible honor."</p><p>And on Monday night, on the eve of the primary, the president joined Van Epps for a tele-rally that was co-hosted by the politically influential conservative outside group Club for Growth, which also backed Van Epps.</p><p>Trump carried the district, which is located in central and western Tennessee and stretches from Kentucky to Alabama, by roughly 20 points in last year's presidential election.</p><p>Van Epps, a lieutenant colonel in the Tennessee Army National Guard and a former Army helicopter pilot, was also backed by prominent House Republican Rep.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> As the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement efforts are met with continued resistance in Chicago, FBI Director Kash Patel passionately defended the bureau’s supporting role in the Windy City, telling Fox News Digital that agents are "just doing their job to safeguard the streets."</p><p>Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche were on the ground touring the Chicago field office on Tuesday morning and explaining why the FBI needed to "flex resources" to help DHS.</p><p>"The environment here in Chicago needs a focused effort, not just on crushing violent crime, but also, removing the illegal aliens that are correlated to that violent crime," Patel told Fox News Digital. "And that's a result over years of failures in policies by the prior administration to allow so many illegal aliens and so much criminal activity to occur here in Chicago, in the state of Illinois."</p><p>While immigration enforcement isn’t a typical part of the FBI’s job, Patel said that "every single three-letter agency" in the Trump administration is "driving towards the same mission." He called the concerted campaign a "whole-of-government approach."</p><p>And Patel added that the mission goes well beyond immigration enforcement, also touching on narcotics distribution, government officials who are suddenly being targeted for death and agents whose lives are being endangered.</p><p>Patel lauded the efforts of the officers serving with the Chicago Police Dept., calling them "great partners" and saying "they are doing their job with us every single day."He drew a stark contrast, however, between the rank-and-file and their bosses."</p><p>But they report to the elected leadership," he said. "And I think it's our duty to call those out who prioritize illegal immigrants and crime over those that they serve in the city they're supposed to protect. So I'll call it out for as long as it takes."</p><p>President Donald Trump’s efforts to deploy National Guard troops to protect federal officials and property in Chicago has already been kicked to the courts.</p><p>But Blanche said it’s clear that the Guard is needed to help clean up the high-crime streets of Chicago.</p><p>"I mean, at this point, it's almost laughable, laughable that the state government is standing up and saying, don't let the National Guard in," Blanche said. "I mean, they have access to the same TV that I have access to. And of course, we need the National Guard."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Democratic candidate for Virginia attorney general Jay Jones canceled a fundraiser scheduled for Thursday night in the wake of backlash he has faced over past text messages in which he fantasized about putting "two bullets" in the head of a Republican colleague.</p><p>The fundraiser was planned to be held at the home of author David Baldacci, but donors expected to attend reportedly received a memo that their contributions would be refunded since the event will be canceled, a person familiar with the matter told Axios.</p><p>The canceled fundraiser suggests the Jones campaign could still be in crisis repair mode after news of his violent rhetoric, which even fellow Virginia Democrats running alongside Jones have condemned. However, those same Virginia Democrats have stopped short of calling for Jones to exit the race.</p><p>On Tuesday, in a new campaign advertisement titled "Two bullets," Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears blasted her Democrat opponent, former Virginia member of Congress from the state's seventh congressional district, Abigail Spanberger, for failing to explicitly call for Jones to bow out of the race.  </p><p>"Jay Jones says he wants to put two bullets in a political opponent," the ad starts out, before pivoting to Spanberger saying, "Let your rage fuel you." The narrator then comes back and begins citing headlines that "Jones says he hopes an opponent’s children die," before, again, highlighting Spanberger's "rage" comments. </p><p>"Abigail Spanberger continues to support Jones," the ad's narrator continues. "She stands with him, not us."</p><p>Jones' opponent, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, released his own massive $1.5 million ad buy in response to Jones' text messages as well.</p><p>The text messages came from Jones in 2022, as he was attempting to describe a hypothetical situation about who he would kill if Jones had a gun with just two bullets and there were three people standing in front of him.</p><p>"Three people, two bullets," the text messages read. "Gilbert, hitler, and pol pot. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head," Jones wrote, referring to then-Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert. He added: "Spoiler: put Gilbert in the crew with the two worst people you know and he receives both bullets every time."</p><p>The surfaced text messages from 2022 come at a time of heightened sensitivity to inflammatory and violent political rhetoric following the assassination of Charlie Kirk and two attempted assassinations of President Donald Trump.</p><p>Even Democrats have warned – in the wake of Kirk's recent assassination – that "violent words precede violent actions" and "we should have a culture of condemning any rhetoric that glorifies violence."</p><p>Jones did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on this story. Representatives for Miyares declined to comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Deion Sanders' health has been a closely followed topic this offseason. In June, reports surfaced that the Pro Football Hall of Famer was sidelined with an unspecified illness.</p><p>In July, Sanders revealed he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of bladder cancer. During a news conference with his doctors, Sanders shared that a portion of his intestine had been surgically reconstructed to function as a bladder.</p><p>In his postgame press conference on Saturday, Sanders predicted he was facing more blood clots. "Cat’s out of the bag, all right. I think I’ve got more blood clots," Sanders said on Saturday. "It don’t make sense. I’m hurting like crazy… I’m not getting blood to my leg. That’s why my leg is throbbing."</p><p>The blood clot issue resulted in the amputation of two toes on his left foot in 2021. Sanders was coaching at Jackson State at the time. In 2023, the two-time Super Bowl champion missed Pac-12 media day to address a blood clot in his right leg and another surgery to correct curved toes on his left foot.</p><p>Sanders said Tuesday's operation, which is known as an aspiration thrombectomy, is expected to take several hours. He plans to return to the sideline in time for Colorado's practice on Wednesday.</p><p>"I am having a procedure today," Sanders said during a press conference on Tuesday. "Prayerfully, I’ll be right back tomorrow ‘cause I don’t miss practice. I don't plan on doing such. It is what it is, and we found what we found… I have a wonderful team of doctors at UC Health and a wonderful team of trainers here."</p><p>He added: "It has nothing to do with me working at the level I'm trying to compete at. It is hereditary. It is what it is… I trust God with all my heart and all my soul and all my mind."</p><p>Former NFL player Adam "Pacman" Jones attended Tuesday's media session as a show of support. Sanders appreciates all the texts and phone calls from people expressing their concern over his health.</p><p>"I’ve got a lot of well-wishes, of people talking about: ‘You need to slow down. You need to take a break,’" Sanders said. "There’s nothing that I could’ve done to stop what’s transpiring. Nothing that I could’ve taken or something that I’m just not abiding by. It is what it is."</p><p>Following his bladder cancer diagnosis and treatment, Sanders frequently needs to use the restroom, so the school introduced a portable sideline bathroom for him during games that’s sponsored by Depend underwear.</p><p>"I’m going to go in there [surgery], and I’m going to get some of the best sleep in the world for, I think, four hours, the surgery is going to be," Sanders said Tuesday.</p><p>"I’ve never been high a day in my life. I’ve never drank, smoked or anything. But when I get those surgeries, I am there on time."</p><p>The Buffaloes are 15-16 since Sanders took over as their coach leading into the 2023 season.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>HarperCollins UK issued an apology to First Lady Melania Trump after it published "unverified claims" about her in a book. </p><p>"HarperCollins UK recently published a book by Andrew Lownie titled ‘Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York.’ We have, in consultation with the author, removed passages of the book that referenced unverified claims about the First Lady of the United States Melania Trump," HarperCollins UK wrote in a statement Tuesday. </p><p>"Copies of the book that include those references are being permanently removed from distribution. HarperCollins UK apologizes to the First Lady," the statement added. </p><p>Melania Trump shared the statement, which was first posted on HarperCollins UK's X account, to her nearly 4 million X followers.  </p><p>The book, which focuses on Prince Andrew, examines the disgraced royal's ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Lownie alleged that Epstein introduced Donald Trump to Melania. Representatives for the first lady rejected the claim, pointing to her own book which states she met her husband at New York City's Kit Kat Club in 1998 and was not introduced to him by Epstein. </p><p>Melania Trump's team has taken swift action towards those who've promoted the false claim. Back in July, The Daily Beast retracted an article it had published based on comments made by Michael Wolff, who echoed the fabricated Epstein connection. The outlet later issued an apology. </p><p>"The Daily Beast recently published a story headlined ‘Melania Trump ‘Very Involved’ in Epstein Scandal: Author’ based on an interview with Michael Wolff. Upon reflection, we have determined that the article did not meet our standards and has therefore been removed from our platforms," The Daily Beast said in a statement last month.</p><p>"In response to a letter from the first lady’s attorneys, The Daily Beast has also removed a portion of an episode of The Daily Beast Podcast titled ‘Trump’s Epstein Scandal Can’t Stop Won’t Stop’ referencing the first lady," the statement continued. "The first lady points to her bestselling book ‘Melania’ as the definitive account of her life story. We apologize to the first lady and our readers."   </p><p>Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville repeated the claim on his own podcast and similarly issued a retraction and an apology. </p><p>"In last week's podcast episode, we spoke with Judd Legum," Carville said. "After the episode, we received a letter from Melania Trump's lawyer. He took issue with our title of one of those YouTube videos from that episode and a couple of comments I made about the first lady. We took a look at what they complained about, and we took down the video and edited out those comments from the episode. I also take back these statements and apologize."</p><p>Attorneys for Melania Trump also sent a $1 billion legal threat against Hunter Biden after he made the claim as a guest on Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan. Biden dismissed the threat and refused to apologize. </p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Three victims remained in critical condition in a Sacramento hospital on Tuesday night, a day after <span class="link">a medical helicopter crashed onto Highway 50.</span></p><p>On board the REACH flight were the pilot, a paramedic and a nurse who was <span class="link">identified to CBS Sacramento by family as Suzie Smith</span> of Redding. The pilot and paramedic have not yet been identified.</p><p>The Sacramento Fire Department said, when they first arrived on scene after 7 p.m., its crew called on drivers to help them lift the helicopter to free Smith, who was pinned under the wreckage.</p><p>Terry De Crescenzo captured the moment on video as her husband, Ken, and more than a dozen other bystanders raced to help. </p>
<p>It came after <span class="link">the chopper crashed</span> just feet in front of their car. No drivers or passengers on the highway were injured.</p>
<p>"I realized there were no other cars around that were hit, and I thought, how did that happen?" Terry asked, with Ken calling it "a miracle."</p><p>The group of people is captured on video lifting the chopper as paramedics free Smith.</p><p>"We just ran up to it and found a spot to grab onto the helicopter and just pushed and lifted it best we could, we had to lift it up," said Ken.</p><p>Another driver, Priscilla Cochran-Navarra, also ran to help. She was in the first row of cars that slammed on their brakes as the chopper came crashing down before her eyes.</p>
<p>"A few of us tried to lift the helicopter at first and, initially, when I felt how heavy, like there was no movement, it wouldn't budge at all. But when fifteen people or so came to do it, it was just seemed like the impossible became possible," said Cochran-Navarra.</p><p>Not only that, Cochran-Navarra  also says she was the first to get to Smith's side, comforting the nurse as she was pinned and pleading for help.</p><p>"I lay down on the ground, and I just tell her, 'You're alive. You're alive. Just stay still.' I said, 'You're not alone. I'm not going to leave you. You're not alone.' It was just crazy. It was crazy. Sorry, I keep playing it. She's screaming for help, like, 'Help me. Help me,' " said Cochran-Navarra through tears.</p><p>She said she was proud to see her city come together in that moment.</p><p>"It was good to see Sacramento united," said Cochran-Navarra. "I don't think I've ever felt that since 9/11, you know? At that time, everyone came together. It didn't matter what you did, who you are, who you love, who you prayed to. None of that made a difference."</p><p>These good Samaritans say they were grateful they were in the right place at the right time to help and that no one was injured.</p><p>"My first thought was, how amazing. And I mean this sincerely, that nobody questioned. Everybody was just like, these are human beings that need us, and everybody just ran to help them," said Terry.</p>
<p>Cochran-Navarra said her prayer is to reunite with Smith after she hopefully makes a full recovery.</p><p>"I hope that I'm able just to, just to tell her how incredibly happy I am that she's alive and and I would tell her I'm so grateful that I was able to help her," said Cochran-Navarra through tears.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Officials are investigating after a medical helicopter crashed on a Sacramento freeway Monday evening, critically injuring the three people on board, authorities said.</p><p>The Sacramento Fire Department said a REACH helicopter went down shortly after 7 p.m. on eastbound Highway 50 near 59th Street. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, the helicopter had just taken off from the UC Davis Medical Center and was destined for Redding. </p><p>Three crew members — a pilot, a nurse and a paramedic — were in the helicopter and suffered critical injuries, Captain Justin Sylvia of Sacramento Fire   said. All three were taken to the UC Davis Medical Center for treatment, UC Davis officials stated.   </p><p>The family of the nurse identified her in a statement as Suzie Smith.</p><p>"Suzie is currently receiving amazing care at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. She is in critical condition with multiple serious injuries.  Those who know Susie know that she is a tough and strong woman," the statement said.</p>
<p>The helicopter had taken a patient to a hospital and was returning to its dispatch point when it had an "in-air emergency," The Associated Press quotes Sylvia as saying.</p><p>No vehicles on the freeway were involved, which Sylvia told the AP was "mind blowing" since the aircraft crashed in the center of the freeway.</p><p>Video obtained by CBS Sacramento from a person inside a vehicle in the westbound lanes of the highway captured the moment the helicopter went down.  </p><p>Two crew members were located in the roadway while one of the crew members was trapped under the helicopter when the first unit from the fire department arrived, Sylvia said. A fire captain and bystanders who offered help were able to lift the aircraft off the trapped crew member.</p>
<p>"We are in the process of determining the details of this situation, as well as the condition of the REACH crew involved, who were all taken to area hospitals," REACH said in a statement, adding that it is "keeping all those impacted in our thoughts and prayers."</p><p>The helicopter involved was an Airbus EC-130 T2, according to the NTSB. </p><p>One lane of Eastbound Highway 50 had been reopened at 59th Street to allow for traffic to pass through, the California Highway Patrol said. All Highway 50 lanes were reopened by early Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>The cause of the crash remains under investigation. The Sacramento County Sheriff's Office said it is assisting the CHP, which said it will help the NTSB in the probe. The Federal Aviation Administration says it will be investigating. </p>

<p>Members of the Texas National Guard have begun arriving at a U.S. Army Reserve facility in Chicago's far southwestern suburbs, where they're expected to participate in training before they are sent on their assignments to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and facilities.</p><p>On Tuesday afternoon, CBS News Chicago crews spotted National Guard troops dressed in camouflage with Texas National Guard patches walking around the U.S. Army Reserve Training Center in Elwood, near Joliet, about 50 miles southwest of Chicago. </p><p>Several trailers have been set up as temporary living quarters. Several soldiers were seen moving in with bags of belongings; some holding rifles and carrying folding chairs, possibly for meetings or other trainings. Fencing was also put up around the facility late Tuesday.</p><p>Retired U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Richard Hayes was the highest-ranking member of the Illinois National Guard. In his 30-plus-year career, he said he's never seen a National Guard from a different state federalized and then sent to another state.    </p><p>"This is novel.

It's not a political organization, they're just here to do what they're being asked to do."</p>
<p>State Representative Larry Walsh Jr. said he got word late Monday that the Elwood site would be the home base for the troops. </p><p>"This is a lot of political theater," he said. "There's a whole communication disconnect between the federal and local governments."</p><p>If federalized, the National Guard would take their orders from the federal government and not the state.</p><p>"If the courts later say it's not proper or not legal, then they'll stand down," Hayes said.</p>
<p>"I would ask the federal government and the administration, come on… let's just start working as adults," Walsh Jr. said.<strong> </strong></p><p>Roughly 200 members of the Texas National Guard will deploy to Chicago this week, sources familiar with the operation told CBS News.</p><p>Members of the Texas National Guard are expected to begin their assignments in Chicago as soon as Wednesday, after receiving an operational brief, ahead of a federal court hearing on Thursday on a lawsuit filed by the state of Illinois and city of Chicago, which are seeking to block the troop deployment.</p>
<p>State and local leaders said they have largely been left in the dark about the troop deployment and given no details on the troops' mission.</p><p>Will County Executive Jennifer Bertino-Tarrant, a Democrat, said her office was not notified by the Trump administration about the National Guard deployment in Elwood, including how many troops were being stationed there or how long the operation would last.</p><p>"The arrival of the National Guard by the Trump Administration is an aggressive overreach. Our federal government moving armed troops into our community should be alarming to everyone," she said in a statement. "I will be coordinating with local leaders to make sure we are doing everything in our power to protect the rights of our residents and the safety of everyone. Hopefully, the federal court hearing on Thursday will end this attack on our community."</p><p>The Illinois National Guard has also been ordered to report for training on Tuesday, although it's unclear if they'll also be stationed in Elwood.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has said members of the National Guard will be assigned to the protection of federal facilities and federal law enforcement personnel, including the ICE facility in the west Chicago suburb of Broadview, and in downtown Chicago. </p>
<p>On Monday evening, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott posted a photo to X with a caption reading, "The elite Texas National Guard. Ever ready. Deploying now." The photo shows Texas National Guard members boarding a plane.</p><p>On Sunday evening, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said President Trump had ordered <span class="link">National Guard</span> members from <span class="link">Texas</span> to be deployed to Illinois.</p><p>In a statement, Pritzker said 400 members of the Texas National Guard will be deployed to Illinois, Oregon, and other locations within the U.S.</p><p>As members of the Texas National Guard were arriving in Illinois, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson – who has vehemently opposed the deployment – was asked about their mission.</p><p>"There is a process that the National Guard goes through before they're actually released into the streets of Chicago or anywhere," he said. "But what's really disturbing about all of this is that the National Guard, they have no policing authority or any policing powers. It's not what they're trained to do."</p><p>While a West Coast federal judge approved a temporary restraining order blocking Texas National Guard troops from deploying to Portland, Oregon, a federal judge in Chicago declined to immediately grant a similar request on Monday to halt the deployment in Illinois. The judge has scheduled a hearing for Thursday to rule on the request to block the deployment.</p><p>On Sunday, a <span class="link">memo obtained by CBS News from the Pentagon</span> called for hundreds of National Guard troops to be sent to Illinois. Pritzker on Saturday said that the Trump administration intended to <span class="link">federalize 300 Illinois National Guard members</span> after he was offered an ultimatum on troop deployment. The ultimatum by the Trump administration, according to Pritzker, was "call up your troops, or we will."</p>
<p>The Illinois National Guard members were not expected to be ready to deploy prior to Thursday's court hearing, sources said. Those personnel will undergo additional training, including civil disturbance training in the coming days, and be assigned necessary protective equipment.     </p><p>"Bringing in Texas National Guard is really a vast overreach of the federal government here," former Illinois National Guard Adj. Gen. William Enyart said.  </p><p>Enyart said that without roots in Chicago and a nuanced understanding of the area, troops from another state would be at a severe disadvantage. </p><p>"To bring in someone from 1,000 miles away, who doesn't have any of those contacts, who doesn't have any of that network developed, is absolutely a hazard to public safety," he said.</p><p>Pritzker has repeatedly declined to call up the guard during the period of increased immigration enforcement, which the federal government has dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz." <span class="link">Pritzker has also accused</span> the Trump administration, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino of intentionally sowing chaos in order to justify the deployment.</p><p><span class="link">The Illinois Attorney General's team</span> and Chicago city attorneys will be back in federal court this coming Thursday in an effort to stop the mobilization of troops.</p><p>Meanwhile, attorneys for the Village of Broadview, home of an ICE processing center that has drawn heated protests and confrontations, were to appear in front of a judge on Tuesday to argue for the removal of a fence the federal government put up outside an ICE facility on Beach Street in Broadview.</p>
<p>They said the federal government did not get a permit for the fence and that it is illegal to block a public street. The judge in the case said they would rule on the village's bid to take down the fence in the next couple of days.</p><p>Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson could also see legal action soon regarding a protest curfew she enacted Monday night. She said village resources cannot keep up with repeated demonstrations outside the ICE processing center, so she is limiting gatherings there to be between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.</p><p>"Let me be clear, I will always support the First Amendment and right of people to peacefully protest," Thompson said Monday. "But as mayor, I must also balance the right with the safety and well-being of Broadview residents and the businesses."</p>

<div class="article-title">Tropical Storm Jerry forms over the central Atlantic Ocean</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Tropical Storm Jerry formed Tuesday over tropical waters in the central Atlantic Ocean, the National Hurricane Center said. It is the 10th named storm of the 2025 hurricane season.</p><p>The newly developed system was far from land when the hurricane center issued its first advisory for Jerry. Forecasters said the storm was more than 1,030 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands, the Caribbean chain east of Puerto Rico that starts with the Virgin Islands and extends down to Guadeloupe. </p><p>Jerry had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as it tracked west-northwest at 23 mph across the open ocean as of Tuesday night, according to forecasters. It was expected to steadily strengthen and eventually grow into a hurricane in a day or so, the hurricane center said in its 11 p.m. ET update.</p><p>A tropical storm watch was in effect for the Caribbean islands of Barbuda, Anguilla, St. Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat, St. Barthelemy, Saint Martin, Sint Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Guadeloupe and the adjacent islands. </p>
<p>On its forecast track, Jerry is expected to be near or north of the northern Leewards by late Thursday or Friday, the hurricane center said. Although the storm isn't currently expected to make landfall, the swells it generates will likely reach the islands on Thursday, causing life-threatening surf and rip currents, according to the latest advisory.</p>
<p>It is forecast to bring up to 4 inches of rain to the Leeward Islands, the hurricane center said, including the risk of flash flooding.  </p><p>Jerry developed on the heels of several Atlantic storm systems, including <span class="link">Hurricane Humberto</span> and <span class="link">Hurricane Imelda</span>, which emerged at the end of September. Concerns that both could strike Bermuda briefly circulated, but only Imelda ultimately brushed the coast of the island as a Category 2 hurricane, before quickly weakening on its way out to the open ocean. </p>
<p>Humberto and Imelda also threatened the southeastern United States with destructive surf, causing multiple coastal homes in North Carolina's Outer Banks <span class="link">to collapse</span>.</p><p>This has been a relatively <span class="link">quiet hurricane season</span>, which typically runs annually from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. While Jerry is the 10th named storm this year, just one of the nine others — <span class="link">Chantal</span> — actually made landfall in the U.S. </p>
<p>When the current season began, <span class="link">an outlook</span> released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration indicated that between 13 and 19 named storms would form in the Atlantic, with up to nine becoming hurricanes and as many as five strengthening into powerful Category 5 storms. But, as the months progressed, <span class="link">NOAA revised its outlook</span> in August to predict that 13 to 18 named storms would form, including five to nine hurricanes. </p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Hurricane Priscilla intensified into a Category 2 storm off the west coast of Mexico, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said Tuesday. </p><p>Priscilla's outer bands were spreading over Baja California Sur. Forecasters anticipate that the storm will bring heavy rains and gusty winds to sections of the peninsula into Wednesday, with a tropical storm watch in effect from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro, Mexico.</p><p>As of Tuesday night, Priscilla had maximum sustained winds of 105 miles per hour, the hurricane center said. It was moving northwest at 9 mph. </p>
<h2>aHurricane Priscilla's track and forecast</h2><p>On the forecast track, Priscilla's center will move parallel to the coast of west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur over the next several days, while remaining offshore. </p><p>"Additional weakening is expected on Wednesday, continuing through the rest of the week," the hurricane center said.</p><p>According to the center's latest update Tuesday, the storm was located about 375 miles west of Cabo Corrientes, Mexico, near the resort town of Puerto Vallarta, and about 190 miles south-southwest of Baja California's southern tip.</p>
<p>From Tuesday into Wednesday, the hurricane center said, 1 to 2 inches of rain are forecast in southern Baja California Sur and parts of west-central Mexico, with local totals up to 4 inches. </p>
<p>"This rainfall could bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain," the center cautioned.</p><p>Forecasters also warned of dangerous swells generated by Priscilla, which were impacting coastal areas of southwestern and west-central Mexico, in addition to the southern Baja California peninsula.</p><p>"These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions," the hurricane center said.</p><h2>Possible U.S. impact</h2><p>The southwestern U.S. may feel the effects of Priscilla later this week, too.</p>
<p>"From late this week into this weekend, moisture from Priscilla leads to heavy rainfall and a flash flood risk over portions of the U.S. Desert Southwest," the center said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Veterans' group invests $1 million between Virginia, New Jersey gubernatorial contests</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>VoteVets, a liberal group that typically backs veterans running for office, is pouring $1 million into aggressive ad campaigns backing the Democratic candidates in Virginia's and New Jersey's gubernatorial contests with less than 30 days until Election Day.</p><p>Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor of New Jersey, is a former Navy helicopter pilot. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for the same job in Virginia, was a CIA operations officer before entering politics. </p><p>The $500,000-apiece ad campaigns take direct aim at the Republican nominee for governor of New Jersey, Jack Ciattarelli, and the GOP candidate in Virginia, Winsome Earle-Sears. VoteVets says both ads feature veterans of the armed services discussing economic difficulties and alleging a GOP governor would make things worse for them.</p><p>"After a decade of Coast Guard rescues, I came home to make a go of it. But Jersey is so damn expensive right now," a Coast Guard veteran says in the New Jersey ad. "And Jack Ciattarelli will make it worse. He already voted to raise property taxes and was even talking about a 10% sales tax."</p><p>Ciattarelli has pushed back on allegations that he supports raising the state's sales tax to 10%, a claim also made in ads paid for by his Democratic opponent's campaign. He says his comments were taken out of context.</p>
<p>"Mikie Sherrill and her allies are lying about Jack," a spokesperson for Ciattarelli said in a statement. "As governor, he has a plan to cut taxes for working and middle class New Jerseyans, while Mikie Sherrill has a history of voting to raise taxes again and again in Congress."</p><p>In the Virginia ad, a Navy veteran attempts to connect Earle-Sears to President Trump's economic policies, although she has not been endorsed by the president. </p><p>"Instead of fighting for Virginia, Winsome Earle-Seals went right along with the Trump budget that's raising our costs even higher," the veteran says in the ad. "Health care. Housing. Electricity. And those tariffs, driving up prices on just about everything else."</p><p>CBS News has reached out to Ciattarelli and Earle-Sears' campaigns for comment and will update this story if they respond.</p>
<p>VoteVets placed a separate half-million-dollar ad campaign supporting Spanberger in August, and the group's political action committee directly invested another $500,000 into her campaign earlier in the cycle.</p><p>VoteVets additionally transferred nearly $80,000 to the Democratic Party of New Jersey and launched a $100,000 cable ad buy in the contest for Virginia's 64th state House district. </p><p>Virginia and New Jersey are two of the only states to hold statewide elections a year after the presidential race, so their gubernatorial contests are typically closely watched — and are often treated as referenda on the newly elected president.</p><p>Both races have heated up significantly in recent weeks, with news stories threatening to upend the contests. </p><p>In New Jersey, legal <span class="link">threats</span> linger over the contest after CBS News reported that a branch of the National Archives admitted to releasing a mostly unredacted version of Sherrill's military records to a Ciattarelli ally, including her Social Security number and other private information. Sherrill has alleged her records were released intentionally, which Ciatarelli's campaign has denied. Sherrill has also faced attacks from the right seeking to link her to the 1994 Naval Academy cheating scandal — she was not accused of cheating, and she says her only involvement was her failure to inform on her classmates.</p><p>Meanwhile in Virginia, Spanberger has faced attacks after Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones <span class="link">admitted</span> he sent text messages in 2022 that contained violent and inflammatory language about several Republicans.</p><p>Spanberger condemned Jones's violent rhetoric, but she has faced criticism from the right for not calling on him to drop out of the race. Earle-Sears's campaign also released an ad connecting Spanberger to Jones.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump-backed Matt Van Epps wins GOP primary in Tennessee House race</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Matt Van Epps is projected to win a crowded Republican primary Tuesday in the special election to replace a former Tennessee GOP congressman, according to The Associated Press.</p><p>Van Epps will face off in December against Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn, who is projected to win a four-way primary for the Democratic nomination.</p><p>Van Epps clinched the GOP victory following an endorsement from President Trump that came after in-person early voting ended. Eleven Republicans were on the ballot for the seat vacated by former Rep. Mark Green, who <span class="link">resigned over the summer</span> due to "an opportunity in the private sector that was too exciting to pass up." Among them, two candidates suspended their campaigns after Mr. Trump weighed in and joined the president in endorsing Van Epps.</p>
<p>"Thank you to the people of Middle and West Tennessee! Our Donald J. Trump-endorsed campaign won in a landslide tonight," Van Epps said on social media. "Now, on to December 2nd! We're going to win the general and keep this seat RED!"</p><p>If Republicans hold onto the seat, it would slightly expand their margin in the U.S. House, where the GOP holds a single-digit majority. The general election in December could also gauge the popularity of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, especially with Republican-leaning suburban voters in the Nashville area.</p><p>The 7th Congressional District spans 14 counties, bordering both Kentucky and Alabama. Along with parts of Nashville, it includes rural areas, wealthy suburbs and part of a military installation, Fort Campbell. The seat is one of three districts that GOP lawmakers drew as safely red in 2022 by dividing left-leaning Nashville. Its voters elected Green by 21 percentage points in 2024 and by nearly 22 points in 2022.</p>
<p>Of its nine seats in the House, Tennessee currently has one Democrat, Rep. Steve Cohen of Memphis. Republican redistricting in 2022 allowed the GOP to flip another Democratic seat that was drawn to include only part of Nashville.</p><p>Van Epps previously served in several roles under Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee. During the primary campaign, Van Epps leaned into his military experience, including as a Tennessee Army National Guard lieutenant colonel and as an Army Special Operations helicopter pilot. Among the competitors he defeated were state Reps. Jody Barrett and Gino Bulso.</p><p>Behn is a social worker and community organizer who has focused on women's reproductive health rights, including as a plaintiff in a lawsuit against a Tennessee law banning adults from helping minors get an abortion without parental permission. A judge has halted the provision's enforcement.</p><p>Mr. Trump endorsed Van Epps in a Truth Social post late last week that praised him as an "America First Patriot."</p>
<p>"A West Point Graduate, and Combat Decorated Army Helicopter Pilot, Matt knows the WISDOM and COURAGE required to Defend our Country, Support our Incredible Military/Veterans, and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH," Mr. Trump wrote.</p><p>The nod from Mr. Trump followed Van Epps' prior endorsements from Lee, Green and Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. </p><p>Outside groups spent more than $3.1 million on the race, almost all on the GOP side, with about $1.1 million opposing Barrett.</p><p>The Republican primary contenders praised Mr. Trump and expressed staunch opposition to anything perceived as liberal or "woke." Meanwhile, in the Democratic primary, the four candidates attacked the legislation Mr. Trump dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," in addition to his tariffs.</p>

<html><body><div><article class="content content-article lazyload" data-index="0" data-path="/news/herschel-walker-trump-ambassador-bahamas-senate/" id="article-0">
<section class="content__body">
<p>The Senate on Tuesday confirmed former football star Herschel Walker to serve as U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas. </p><p>President Trump nominated Walker for the diplomatic post <span class="link">last year</span>, after the retired running back entered the political fray by running as the Republican nominee in Georgia's 2022 Senate race. <span class="link">He lost to</span> incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock by 2.8 points in a runoff.</p><p>Walker is the <span class="link">first Senate-confirmed ambassador</span> to the Bahamas in over a decade.</p><p>Walker won the Heisman Trophy in 1982 with the University of Georgia Bulldogs, and played professionally for three years for the U.S. Football League's New Jersey Generals — a team that Mr. Trump bought toward the end of Walker's career with the upstart league. After the USFL folded, Walker played in the NFL for more than a decade.</p><p>He ran for Senate three years ago with Mr. Trump's backing. Walker's campaign was dogged by <span class="link">accusations that he paid</span> several women to get abortions in the 1990s and 2000s, despite his opposition to the procedure while on the campaign trail. Walker vehemently denied the allegations.</p>
<p>Walker was also named to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition during Mr. Trump's first term, but was removed during the Biden administration.</p><p>"Herschel has spent decades serving as an Ambassador to our Nation's youth, our men and women in the Military, and athletes at home and abroad," Mr. Trump wrote in a December Truth Social post nominating Walker to the ambassador role.</p><p>Walker and more than 100 other Trump nominees were confirmed Tuesday in a single 51-47 vote, part of a <span class="link">rules change</span> by Senate Republicans that allows them to approve large groups of executive branch nominees "en bloc" with a simple majority rather than voting on them one by one. They changed the rules <span class="link">amid frustration</span> that Democrats had slowed the nomination process to a crawl — though Democrats accused Republicans of going "nuclear."</p><p>Another high-profile nominee who was approved in Tuesday's package is former White House aide Sergio Gor for ambassador to India.</p>
<p>The nominees were approved while the Senate remained at an impasse <span class="link">over the government shutdown</span>. The body is expected to weigh competing Democratic and Republican proposals to reopen the government Wednesday — but both bills have been voted down multiple times.</p>

<div class="article-title">California's redistricting plan sparks fierce debate in 2026 governor's race</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>California's controversial plan to redraw its congressional maps mid-decade is among the most pressing issues discussed by <span class="link">candidates in the 2026 gubernatorial race</span>.</p><p>Proposition 50, placed on the ballot by the state legislature for a November special election, would authorize California lawmakers to redraw the state's congressional districts.</p><p>The redistricting effort, backed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, is aimed at sending more Democrats to Congress by redrawing<span class="link"> five of the state's districts for U.S. House seats</span> to be more favorable to Democrats in next year's midterm elections. California Democrats call it a countermeasure to President Trump's push for <span class="link">Texas' recent redistricting</span>, which favors Republicans in the midterms.</p><p>Unlike in Texas, California voters took the power to draw these maps away from lawmakers in 2020 and established an independent redistricting commission. Proposition 50 would give that power back to lawmakers for the next five years, through the next presidential election.</p><p>Over several weeks in September, CBS News California Investigates sat down with each candidate to ask questions on a variety of issues that matter to voters, including Proposition 50. </p>
<p>While Democratic candidates generally backed Proposition 50 along party lines, some admitted unease when pressed on the controversial partisan details. Republican and Green Party opponents defended their opposition as they responded to arguments in favor of the measure.</p>
<h2>What do you think of the governor's plan?</h2>
<p>Former Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat who served as Health and Human Services Secretary in the Biden administration, defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington, saying it would "make sure that Donald Trump doesn't put his thumb on the scale on the votes in Congress."</p><p>Republican candidate Steve Hilton condemned the plan, saying outright that it is "totally corrupt and it's unconstitutional and it is illegal."</p><p>"Politicians shouldn't draw their own maps," Hilton said. "I mean, that's obviously wrong and corrupt. Common sense tells you that."</p>
<p>Former state Assemblymember Ian Calderon, also a Democrat, said he supports the plan and emphasized California's position as a donor state.</p><p>"At the end of the day, if we're going to have hope of any type of leverage throughout the next couple of years during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress, so that we could fight back and secure the money that is coming to California," Calderon said.</p><p>However, he acknowledged unease with the Democratic gerrymandering and noted that his wife vehemently opposed Prop 50.  "She thinks that districts should be drawn by independent redistricting commissions and that it is wrong for the state to be putting its finger on the scale, Calderon said.  </p><p>Republican candidate Leo Zacky called the proposal "unconstitutional," criticizing Democratic lawmakers for redrawing the independent redistricting commission's maps for their own partisan purposes. </p><p>"The way that it's set up is that we, the people, are supposed to figure out how the districts are supposed to be drawn," he said. "[Newsom is] violating the Constitution. He's spending a ton of money doing it. It's trash. It's a waste."</p><p>Green Party candidate Butch Ware accused Democrats of consolidating power under the guise of fighting Republican overreach.</p><p>"In the state of California, are y'all feeling that this has been a state that has been well-run and for your best interest? So you're going to essentially hand them the keys to make sure that they own every district in the state? You imagine thinking that you can fight fascism with fascism," Ware said.</p>
<p>While Democratic former State Controller Betty Yee called the redistricting effort "essential" to prevent the manipulation of elections, "as the president has asked the state of Texas to do."</p><p>"We have a process for this. It's after every decennial census… And just the idea that there is manipulation that is being directed from the top, that's going to affect California's representation, our proportionate representation," Yee said. "We have to fight that."</p><p>Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, who is running as a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is California's opportunity to counter "gerrymandering coming out of states like Texas."</p><p>"Not only will it give voters something better and the chance to gain five new Democratic seats. We're doing it in a way that is transparent," he said. "We're going to do it in a way that lets the voters decide."</p><p>Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, also a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is a necessary response to Republican attempts to rig elections elsewhere.</p><p>"Let the people decide, and I'm for it. I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do," Villaraigosa said.</p><p>Businessman Steve Cloobeck, a Democrat, supported the plan and said "we have to preserve Democracy." Another Democrat, Katie Porter, who's a law professor and former member of Congress, said she is in "support of the governor's plan."</p>
<p>Republican Sheriff Chad Bianco of Riverside County expressed opposition.</p><p>"It's like saying murder is not acceptable, so I'm going to go murder you," Bianco said. "Let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more."</p><h2>Message to Californians who voted for Trump</h2>
<p>The Democratic candidates also explained their message   to the roughly 40% of California voters who supported Donald Trump in 2020, voters whose political representation could be diminished under the new district maps.</p><p>Becerra said he would talk to them "straight out" and emphasized his intention to win every vote. Becerra also emphasized that now is the time to stand up for the rule of law and Democracy.</p><p>"No one should do power grabs. No one is a king. No one has a right to deny you your vote," he said.</p><p>Like Becerra, Calderon said his campaign would focus on listening to all voters, not just talking at them.</p><p>"There are a lot of Republicans in the state who don't necessarily love everything Trump is doing," Calderon said. "They just want to be heard."</p>
<p>Thurmond echoed similar arguments, saying that many of Mr. Trump's voters may not support all of the president's policies.</p><p>"Most Americans do not support attacks on the immigrant communities or education cuts," he said. "Just because they voted for Trump doesn't mean they agree with everything."</p><p>Yee acknowledged that some voters, particularly in rural Republican districts, may feel disenfranchised.</p><p>"What I will say to them also is, look, these are areas of the state that actually want to become vital economies. These are areas that actually have probably disproportionate rates of people on Medicaid. These are parts of the states where people are relying on food assistance more than probably other parts," Yee said. "I would just say, who's going to best represent those interests when those cuts are upon you?"</p><p>Businessman Steve Cloobeck emphasized loyalty to California's interests rather than party politics.</p><p>"I would look at the polls of the state right now. The polls say protect California. Whatever the California customers want, I will be their leader and represent them," Cloobeck said.</p><p>Villaraigosa said he expects to alienate some voters on both sides, but believes many are still looking for leadership that bridges divides.</p>
<p>"I know there are Democrats that I might alienate in the course of this race, and there will be Republicans I alienate. There will also be Democrats and some Republicans that want a leader who's a uniter who wants to work with both sides, who wants the focus on common sense. So you win a few, you lose a few."</p><p>Porter, who has represented a swing district in Orange County, was the only candidate to refuse to directly answer the question, taking issue with the premise that she might need republican voters to win.</p><p>"How would I need them in order to win?" Porter asked. "If it is me versus a Republican, I think that I will win the people who did not vote for Trump."</p><p>As several of her opponents noted, in California's top-two open primary system, Republican voters could help put a Democratic candidate over the top.  </p><p>Porter then threatened to call off the interview, taking issue with too many follow-up questions. She ultimately stayed and continued answering questions. </p><p>The Republican and Green Party Proposition 50 opponents also defended their opposition to pro-redistricting arguments.  </p><h2>Do two wrongs make a right?</h2>
<p>The candidates also confronted the ethical dilemma that even some Prop 50 supporters acknowledge: Does fighting one partisan maneuver with another set the wrong precedent? In other words, do two wrongs make right?</p>
<p>"It's let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more," Bianco said.</p><p>Becerra defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington.</p><p>"Donald Trump is afraid he's going to lose his slim majority of Republicans come 2026," Becerra said. "So he's trying to rig the process to give himself more Republicans. That is not a Democratic process. We're going to fight as we need to make sure our votes count."</p><p>Calderon offered a conflicted view, calling it "kind of a sh---- choice" but emphasizing the political stakes.</p><p>"If we're going to have hope of any type of leverage during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress."</p><p>Ware warned voters not to fall for partisan manipulation.</p><p>"This doesn't serve the voters of California. It serves the DNC. It does not help us. It helps them," Ware said. "They are using Californians essentially as a prop in their battle between Democrats and Republicans."</p>
<p>Porter said it's not two wrongs, highlighting the nature in which Texas approached its redistricting.</p><p>"What Texas is doing is acting out of the course of the census, not following new census data… They're doing it because Donald Trump instructed them to do it," she said.</p><p>Villaraigosa said he's for letting the people decide on the matter to challenge corruption.</p><p>"I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do," he said.</p><p>Thurmond called the special election on Proposition 50 "an important moment for voters to decide."</p><p>Yee reaffirmed her stance on California's move to counter Texas' redistricting effort.</p><p>"Just the idea that there's manipulation that is being directed from the top that's going to affect California's proportionate representation, we have to fight back," she said.</p>
<p>Cloobeck also highlighted California's position as a donor state.</p><p>"Donald Trump's actions have been such that he wants to just attack California. He has not shown us any gratitude for all the billions of dollars of tax dollars the federal government gets from California," he said.</p><p>Hilton described the difficulty California faces in properly redrawing its congressional districts mid-decade rather than after the federal census every 10 years.</p><p>"By drawing these maps in the middle, they don't know who lives where," he said. "Millions of people have left California. In Los Angeles, whole communities have burned down. Who knows who lives there? There's no way that they can honor that constitutional requirement."</p><p>Hilton stressed that even before Newsom's redistricting effort, California already had "a massively distorted political map."</p><p>Acknowledging that Republicans make up about 40% of the vote in California but have just 17% of the congressional seats, Hilton said, "With this new plan that they've got, it would be down to 6%."</p><p>Hilton argued that those voters are being pushed out of representation altogether, saying that the plan would unfairly increase the weight of Democratic votes by as much as eight times compared to Republican ones.</p>
<p>"We're completely violating the principle of equal protection, the whole idea," Hilton said.</p><p>While candidates differ sharply on Proposition 50, voters will have the final say. The redistricting plan will go before voters in a special election on November 4. If approved, the new congressional maps would remain intact through the 2028 presidential election, until 2030.</p>

<div class="article-title">Kentucky attorney general sues Roblox alleging a "playground for predators"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Kentucky has sued <span class="link">Roblox</span>, alleging that children are accessing violent simulation games on the popular gaming platform, including depictions of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, just weeks after the conservative activist's killing.</p><p>In the 68-page complaint filed Tuesday in Madison Circuit Court in Madison County, the state Attorney General's Office alleges that it is not uncommon for the more than 85 million daily active players on the platform to find themselves in violent or sexual situations, with few safeguards put in place by Roblox. </p><p>"For years, Roblox has ignored this crisis so it could continue turning a profit. Our responsibility is to protect Kentucky children from online exploitation by these predators and the companies like Roblox that knowingly facilitate it," Attorney General Russell Coleman said Tuesday in a statement, referring to the platform as a "playground for predators."</p><p>The complaint alleges Roblox knowingly enabled and facilitated the sexual exploitation and abuse of children across the United States, including in Kentucky. The in-game currency, known as "Robux," is allegedly used by predators to entice children into dangerous situations, court documents state. Several examples cited in the lawsuit include games where Roblox avatars engaged in simulated sexual activity in addition to the graphic shooting of Kirk. </p><p>"We filed a lawsuit to come after Roblox with the full force of the law. My message to parents: get your kids off Roblox," Attorney General Russell Coleman said in a post on X. </p>
<p>Roblox said in a statement to CBS News that the lawsuit was based on "sensationalized, outdated and out-of-context information."</p><p>"At this time, we have had no contact from the Attorney General's office regarding our platform or safety features, but we welcome a direct conversation with the AG's office and all policymakers to ensure they have a clear understanding of all Roblox is doing to keep users safe," Roblox said in its emailed statement. "Keeping kids safe online requires a collaborative industry-wide effort, which we welcome."</p><p>Roblox said it shares "the critically important goal of keeping kids safe online and have years of experience working collaboratively with law enforcement, child safety experts, and families in pursuit of our vision to be the safest platform on the internet."</p><p>A CBS News investigation in August <span class="link">found</span> that Roblox users can bypass safety moderations to expose children to inappropriate content, including swastikas, hate speech and graphic sexual imagery. Several lawsuits were filed against the company, according to the investigation, alleging exploitative practices aimed at children, with more filed in recent weeks. </p>
<p>In August, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill filed a child protection lawsuit against Roblox, alleging the platform is "overrun with harmful content and child predators." Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced in April that he issued a subpoena to Roblox, while the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office recently requested proposals for legal services to investigate and possibly sue Roblox.</p><p>"Our children are not safe on Roblox. Predators and criminals aren't just lurking in the platform's shadows; they've been allowed to commit their crimes out in the open," Attorney General Coleman said Tuesday.</p>

<html><body><div><article class="content content-article lazyload" data-index="0" data-path="/news/comet-passing-by-mars-images/" id="article-0">
<section class="content__body">
<p>A rare interstellar comet — only the third ever confirmed to enter our solar system — was photographed last week, closely approaching Mars, the European Space Agency said Tuesday. </p><p>The images taken on Friday by two Mars orbiters show a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet, also known as <span class="link">3I/ATLAS</span>, appearing to move against a backdrop of distant stars as it was about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars. The comet poses no threat to Earth, NASA has previously said. </p><p>"This was a very challenging observation for the instrument," Nick Thomas, principal investigator of the CaSSIS camera, said in a statement. "The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target." </p>
<p>Since its discovery in July, comet 3I/ATLAS has been photographed several times. In early August, NASA and the European Space Agency <span class="link">shared images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope</span>, which captured the comet from about 277 million miles away.</p><p>Last month, a <span class="link">new image showed the growing tail</span> of 3I/ATLAS from another star system streaking across our solar system. </p><p>NASA has said the comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, passing between the orbits of Mars and Earth. It should remain visible through September before moving too close to the sun to observe, reappearing on the opposite side in early December.</p>
<p>The European Space Agency said Tuesday that scientists will keep analyzing data from both orbiters, combining multiple images from Mars Express in the hope of detecting the faint comet.</p><p>Interstellar comets are very rare, astronomers said. Only two other examples have ever been confirmed: <span class="link">1I/'Oumuamu</span> in 2017 and <span class="link">2I/Borisov</span> in 2019. </p>

<div class="article-title">Illegal crossings at U.S.-Mexico border plummet to lowest annual level since 1970</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2025 plummeted to the lowest annual level since the early 1970s, amid the Trump administration's sweeping clampdown on illegal immigration, internal federal statistics obtained by CBS News show.</p><p>U.S. Border Patrol agents recorded nearly 238,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border illegally in fiscal year 2025, which began in October of last year and ended on Sept. 30, according to the preliminary Department of Homeland Security data, which has not been previously reported.</p><p>The number is the lowest annual tally recorded by Border Patrol since fiscal year 1970, when the agency reported roughly 202,000 apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border, historical figures indicate.</p><p>It also represents a seismic change from the record-high levels of Border Patrol apprehensions recorded under the Biden administration, which faced an unprecedented humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. In fiscal year <span class="link">2022</span>, Border Patrol made 2.2 million apprehensions there — a record, and almost 10 times the levels recorded in 2025.</p><p>More than 60% of the apprehensions made by Border Patrol in fiscal year 2025 along the U.S.-Mexico border were recorded in the last full three months of the Biden administration, the preliminary data shows. Government fiscal years start in October and end in September, and some of them encompass different administrations.</p>
<p>Over President Trump's first full eight months in office, Border Patrol agents assigned to the southern border have recorded fewer than 9,000 apprehensions each month — a number that the agency recorded in 24-hour periods during some days under former President Joe Biden.</p><p>The internal DHS figures show Border Patrol made nearly 8,400 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border in September, an increase from 6,300 in August and 4,600 in July, a monthly record low.</p><p>Border Patrol apprehensions denote the number of times agents intercepted and processed migrants entering the country between official ports of entry, which is illegal. Some migrants can be counted multiple times, if they attempt to enter the U.S. more than once after being turned back to Mexico.</p><p>In a statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, "President Trump has overwhelmingly delivered on his promise to secure our Southern Border."</p>
<p>"As a result, Americans are safer — unvetted criminal illegal aliens and dangerous drugs are no longer pouring over our border unchecked," Jackson added. "And for all the Democrats who claimed it was impossible to secure the border or that they needed new policy, turns out all we needed was a new President."</p> <h2><strong>"A new normal"</strong></h2><p>Ariel Ruiz Soto, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, noted that illegal border crossings began to fall sharply in the summer of 2024, after the Biden administration enacted strict limits on asylum. But he said the Trump administration had set "a new normal" for migration flows in just a few months.</p><p>Ruiz Soto said the Trump administration's stringent policies — at the border and inside the U.S. — "have had a significant effect on people being deterred from coming illegally to the United States." </p><p>Soon <span class="link">after Mr. Trump took office</span> for a second time, his administration moved to seal and militarize the southern border, closing down the American <span class="link">asylum system</span> using emergency powers, <span class="link">dispatching thousands of soldiers</span> to repel illegal crossings and <span class="link">shutting down Biden-era programs</span> that allowed some migrants to enter the U.S. legally.</p><p>While parts of the asylum ban have been <span class="link">curtailed and declared illegal by courts</span>, the Trump administration has virtually ended the practice of releasing migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally, deporting them quickly or holding them in detention while their cases are reviewed. </p><p>Beyond the border, the Trump administration has staged <span class="link">highly publicized operations</span> targeting those living in the U.S. illegally, dispatching teams of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents across the country with the objective of overseeing a deportation campaign of unprecedented proportions. </p><p>The crackdown has not been without controversy. The administration's border policies have been denounced as inhumane, draconian and illegal by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which has challenged them in federal court on the grounds that they are at odds with U.S. and international asylum law as well as the Constitution.</p>
<p>The federal immigration raids well beyond the border have also triggered significant backlash, particularly in major American cities like <span class="link">Chicago</span> and Los Angeles, where large-scale protests have erupted. National and local Democrats have decried the raids as indiscriminate and overly harsh, accusing the Trump administration of not solely focusing on deporting violent offenders.</p><p>Citing confrontations and instances of violence, Mr. Trump in recent days has ordered National Guard troops to deploy to <span class="link">Chicago</span> and Portland, Oregon, to protect immigration agents and facilities there. A federal judge has so far blocked the plan to send National Guard units to Portland.  </p><p>Amid the national debate over immigration enforcement, those living along the southern border say there's no denying the reality on the ground has changed markedly.</p><p>John Martin said his network of shelters in the Texas border city of El Paso housed hundreds of migrants during spikes in illegal crossings during the Biden administration. On Monday, he said his organization was not housing a single migrant, saying he's received "little to no" new arrivals who are not local homeless residents in recent months. He attributed it to Mr. Trump's crackdown.</p><p>"If the goal is to decrease the number of individuals, I would say that appears to have been successful, without getting into the politics about whether or not I like it or dislike it," Martin said. "We're just simply not seeing the people."</p>

<div class="article-title">For older Americans, the cost of poverty is 9 years of life, study finds</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Wealth has long been tied to longevity in the U.S. and other countries, but a new analysis helps quantify the gap between how long low-income older Americans and their more affluent peers tend to live. </p><p>Low-income people over 60 years old die an average of nine years earlier than high-income older Americans, according to the new study from the National Council on Aging﻿ (NCOA) and University of Massachusetts Boston's LeadingAge LTSS Center, which studies aging.</p><p>Generally, middle-income older Americans are also dying younger than wealthier people, the researchers founds. About 15% of seniors with annual household incomes of roughly $60,000 died during the four-year study period, compared with about 11% in households with incomes of around $120,000. </p><p>"This is the first time we've tied health and wealth together — this was really shocking for me," said Jessica Johnston, senior director of the NCOA's Center for Economic Well-Being, of the nine-year life gap. "We all traditionally and culturally were taught to value our elders, and if we played by the rules we could age well, and I think that's changing."</p><p>The study is based on an analysis of data from 2018 to 2022 gathered through the University of Michigan's Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal panel study that tracks 10,000 households. NCOA, a nonprofit group based in Arlington, Virginia, advocates for older adults. </p><p>The findings have implications for an aging society that has seen widening economic inequality, with the income gap between the richest and poorest households growing wider in recent decades, according to the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., as well as to other researchers. </p>
<p>As the U.S. population ages, the divide between rich and poor is also reflected in the experiences of senior citizens, with many reaching retirement age without the financial resources to handle shocks like a health emergency or the loss of a spouse, the NCOA study found.</p><p>The difference in average mortality age by income could be due to a lack of preventative care for low-income seniors, an inability to pay for care as they age or the stress of financial instability, Johnston said. </p><p>The poverty rate among U.S. seniors rose to 15% last year from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to Census data.</p><p>"Older adults are placed into situations where they are going to have to make really difficult decisions: Am I going to go to the grocery store, am I going to pay rent or am I going to get my medication?" Johnston told CBS News. "It's not only about forgoing one of those things, but it's the added stress about those decisions."</p>
<p>About 80% of people over 60 have few, or even zero, financial assets and would struggle to cope with a financial shock like the loss of a spouse or needing long-term care, according to the report. Most of those Americans will face financial insecurity in their later years, the researchers said. </p><p>"If older adults can't afford long-term care or can't afford medicine, family members are often picking up that cost," Johnston said. "The lost economic productivity among Gen Xers and millennials will play out over the next one to two decades."</p>

<div class="article-title">Bob Ross paintings to be auctioned to raise money for public TV after cuts</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Thirty paintings created by the bushy-haired, soft-spoken Bob Ross will soon be up for auction to defray the costs of programming for small and rural public television stations suffering under <span class="link">cuts in federal funding</span>.</p><p>Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, "dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone," said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. "This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades."</p><p>The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, "The Joy of Painting." Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only "happy accidents." He died of cancer complications in 1995. </p><p>Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.</p>
<p>The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.</p>
<p>The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include "The Best of Joy of Painting," based on Ross' show, "America's Test Kitchen," "Julia Child's French Chef Classics" and "This Old House."</p><p>As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has <span class="link">eliminated $1.1 billion allocated</span> to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources. </p><p>Many stations launched emergency fund drives. Some stations have received <span class="link">more help than they expected</span>, CBS News previously reported. North Carolina public radio station WQHR raised more than $200,000 in just three days, surpassing the $174,000 they needed to fill. Hawaii Public Radio lost $525,000, but donations raised $650,000.</p><p>NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs. </p>
<p>Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS <span class="link">slashed its budget</span> by 21% and <span class="link">laid off about 100 employees</span> in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up. </p><p>"I am a realist," PBS president Paula Kerger said in September. "I have to believe that there are some vulnerable stations that are not going to make it."</p><p>National Public Radio president and CEO Katherine Maher <span class="link">told CBS News in July</span> that defunding public media services "is a real risk to the public safety of the country." </p><p>"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation," Maher said in an interview with CBS News. "If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time" to future natural disasters.  <strong>  </strong></p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>BEIJING — About 900 hikers, guides and other staff who were stranded by a weekend snowstorm on the Chinese side of Mount Everest have reached safety, state media said late Tuesday.</p> <p>A severe storm struck the area Saturday night, cutting off access to where the hikers were staying in tents at an altitude of more than 4,900 meters (16,000 feet).</p>
<p>In all, 580 hikers and more than 300 guides, yak herders and other workers were stranded. About 350 hikers were able to descend by noon Monday and the rest had arrived by Tuesday, state media said, citing the local government.</p> <p>Some hikers reportedly had hypothermia, and the official Xinhua News Agency said about a dozen of them were escorted to a meeting point by teams with food, medicine, heating and oxygen supplies.</p> <p>The scenic area at Mount Everest in China's Tibet region has been temporarily closed. The 8,850-meter (29,000-foot) peak, the world's highest, straddles the border with Nepal.</p>
<p>The storm struck during a weeklong holiday that ends Wednesday. Many Chinese travel at home and abroad during the holiday, which marks the anniversary of the start of Communist Party rule in China on Oct. 1, 1949.</p> <p>In Nepal, a South Korean climber died in a weekend storm near the summit of Mera Peak, a 6,476-meter (21,250-foot) Himalayan mountain south of Everest.</p> <p>Early-season snowstorms hit at least two other areas in western China over the weekend, killing one person and stranding motorists on an icy and snowy highway near a scenic hiking spot.</p>
<p>More than 200 people were evacuated from a remote and rugged valley in the Qilian Mountains in Qinghai province. One person died of hypothermia and altitude sickness.</p> <p>The area is undeveloped, and authorities later warned people against entering without permission, citing the difficult terrain, unpredictable weather and an average altitude of more than 4,000 meters (13,000 feet).</p> <p>In northwest China's Xinjiang region, the Kanas scenic area was closed after a snowstorm Sunday that stranded motorists on a nearby highway. The road had been cleared by Monday, state media said.</p>

<div class="article-title">The costs of Israel's longest war, for Israelis</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p><em>This story is part of NPR's coverage of two years since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and the ongoing war in Gaza. For more reporting, analysis and different views of the conflict, go to </em><em>npr.org/mideastupdates</em><em>.  </em></p> <p>JERUSALEM — On a street named Gaza lives Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a top-floor apartment near a sushi restaurant.</p> <p>Outside, one recent afternoon, a father stood holding a megaphone.</p>
<p>"Bibi and Sara," he calls out to the prime minister, using his nickname, and his wife. "It's Rom's dad."</p> <p>Ofir Braslavsky's 21-year-old son Rom is still being held hostage in Gaza, two years after Hamas led an attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, sparking the devastating Gaza war.</p>
<p>As Netanyahu intensified the war this year, families of hostages have intensified their own war with Netanyahu — pressing him to strike a deal with Hamas to get their loved ones back before it's too late.</p>
<p>These families are among those in Israel who have paid the most agonizing personal cost of two years of prolonged war.</p> <p>"I'm not going to let you kill my son and bring him back in a body bag," Braslavsky shouts.</p> <h3 class="edTag">The cost of unprecedented national division during wartime</h3> <p>Camped outside Netanyahu's home with other families of hostages was Mor Goddard, who survived the Hamas-led attack on her kibbutz on the Gaza border, but lost her parents — and more.</p>
<p>"I lost my trust in the country, my trust in the army. Terrorists entered my house, tried to open the safe-room door, and when they didn't succeed, they set the house on fire. And nobody came," Goddard says. "I know what the feeling of abandonment is. Hours when nobody comes. Hours when I hear my friends and parents being murdered."</p> <p>Every day since, she has mourned the road her country has taken in its war against Hamas to retrieve the body of her father, held by Palestinian militants in Gaza as a bargaining chip, and the other hostages.</p> <p>"I think that from Oct. 8 until today, [Israel is] acting out of revenge, and not out of values," she says. "It's like a snowball that rolls and rolls and rolls, that you cannot stop."</p>
<p>This is one cost of the prolonged war: Not all Israelis believe in it any more. A recent poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found some 66% of Israelis want it to end.</p> <p>"The consensus that ... started this war has very much eroded through the time," says Oren Tene, a psychologist and head of the Public Mental Health Institute at Tel Aviv Medical Center. "When a nation goes to war and is not unified in belief that we are doing the right thing, then the propensity for suffering is much higher."</p> <h3 class="edTag">The cost of a national mental health crisis, including among soldiers</h3> <p>In the last two years, Israel's military has battered its enemies and reshaped the region, with its troops invading parts of Lebanon and Syria, and striking Yemen and Iran, all while carrying out a deadly military campaign in the Gaza Strip.</p> <p>At home, Tene has tracked a rise in the use of anti-anxiety medications like Valium and Klonopin. The 12-day war with Iran in June was especially traumatizing, as Iranian missiles pounded Israeli cities and families slept in bomb shelters. He's seen an influx of patients.</p>
<p>"They don't sleep well. They can't concentrate, they feel worried all the time. They don't know if they have a future here," he says.</p> <p>After the Oct. 7 attack, Israel relaxed gun license rules, and issued thousands of firearms a day to civilians shaken by the attack, giving rise to increased cases of domestic violence, according to authorities.</p>
<p>Tene has also treated young soldiers coming back from Gaza traumatized by survivor's guilt, watching their friends get killed alongside them. A total 466 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza, with a high rate of friendly fire accounting for 15% of soldier deaths, according to military figures.</p> <p>He says he has treated many soldiers who acknowledged shooting Palestinian civilians, and who are experiencing what mental health practitioners call moral injury or moral trauma.</p> <p>"Many people describe the fact that they have betrayed their values," he says. "If you shot a child, the child walks with you."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">The cost of apathy to Palestinian suffering</h3> <p>What soldiers see in Gaza, most Israelis do not see. Israeli news has mostly shielded audiences from it.</p> <p>That is another cost of the war for Israelis: a loss of empathy for Palestinian suffering.</p>
<p>Keren Gill, an economist attending a demonstration to end the war and free the Israeli hostages, is sad to see her sympathies toward Gaza change so much in the last two years.</p> <p>"Before Oct. 7, my thinking was, there are families there and there are people who want to live quiet and have their own life," she says. "But today, I don't think that anyone in Gaza is innocent."<strong> </strong></p> <p>She is appalled by Israeli hostages' accounts of some being held captive in families' homes. The military says some were held captive in the home of a Gaza doctor.</p> <p>"Is it reasonable that a doctor in Gaza was taking hostages to his home? I cannot believe it happened. So for me, I don't care about the Gaza people," she says.</p> <h3 class="edTag">The attempt to build empathy</h3> <p>An Israeli researcher of Middle East politics is trying to help restore empathy. Assaf David built an online following by translating to Hebrew the Facebook posts of ordinary Palestinians in Gaza.</p> <p>This post got a lot of attention, written by a father in Gaza, Saed Abu Eita. Roughly translated, it says: "This is my picture with my daughter Mira before the war. I love her very much. I lost her. I didn't get the chance to say goodbye to her, and I don't know who buried her.<em>"</em><strong> </strong></p>
<p>"It got a lot of reaction from Israelis, which was a surprise to me, because I didn't think that Israelis cared much about the suffering of Gaza," David says.</p> <p>He believes social media posts from Gaza help skeptics in Israel gain awareness of the costs Israel has exacted on Palestinians in the war.</p> <p>" I'm too terrified to think about the long-term costs of this lack of empathy, because it feeds on itself," David says. "The psychological costs and mental costs and ethical costs, they affect your soul, and these will be the hardest costs to compensate."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">The cost of global fury at Israel</h3> <p>Protests against Israel's war are common across Europe. Israeli authorities have documented attacks on Jews and Israelis abroad throughout the war. International sports and music competitions are considering bans on Israeli participation. Countries are imposing weapons embargoes, including Israel's staunch ally Germany.</p>
<p>From global sympathy in the days that followed the Oct. 7 attack, Israel is fighting genocide and war crimes accusations in international courts.</p> <p>The Israeli government has warned Israelis to lower their profile abroad, and delete social media posts about their military service. Some countries have pursued war crimes charges against visiting Israelis who have served in the military.</p> <p>That hasn't stopped them from traveling.</p> <h3 class="edTag">The cost of traveling the world as an Israeli</h3> <p>The Tel Aviv international airport is Israelis' gateway to escape the intensity of life at war. That escape route is no longer a given — international flights have been canceled repeatedly with missile fire from Yemen and Iran.</p> <p>In the departure hall is Oshri Avata, 25, traveling to the Eastern European country of Georgia after multiple tours of duty in Gaza and Lebanon serving in an elite undercover unit. While the rest of his unit is doing group therapy with a psychologist to process their experiences, he skipped out.</p>
<p>"I ran away from this. I don't wanna do that. I wanna fly. I wanna see the world ... this is another kind of treatment," he says.</p> <p>Another traveler is Aviv Hajaj, 30. She was supposed to fly to Paris to see Beyoncé perform this summer, but the war with Iran canceled her flight. She is nervous before boarding a flight to Athens, Greece.</p> <p>" I probably will not speak in Hebrew at streets or metros or stuff. So it sucks," she says. "The fact that we need to be scared to travel the world ... I just want it to be over."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">"Our story will have a good ending"</h3> <p>Stickers cover the walls of the airport parking lot bear the smiling faces of young Israeli soldiers killed in the war.</p> <p>One sticker stands out, with a quote from a mother's eulogy to her son, a soldier killed in Gaza: "Our story will have a good ending."</p> <p>When the war does end, Israelis will begin to reckon with the costs they've paid over the last two years.</p> <p><em>NPR's Carrie Kahn contributed to this report from Tel Aviv, Israel.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Democrats take legal aim at 'the Radical Left' language during shutdown</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>There are brewing legal fights against the Trump administration for language it's posting on federal websites and in government emails blaming the Democrats for the government shutdown.</p>
<p>The controversy centers on language posted at the top of federal agency websites and in some automated email responses. They warn the public responses could be slow due to "the Radical Left Democrat Shutdown." Some Democrats and a union representing federal workers argue the language violates the 1939 Hatch Act, which bars employees of the executive branch from doing anything partisan while at work.</p> <p>In a complaint filed with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, former Idaho Democratic state legislator Todd Achilles argues the language is a prohibited political message on public infrastructure.</p>
<p>"I filed the complaint because we don't play politics with public lands," Achilles told NPR. "The Forest Service exists to serve all Americans regardless of political affiliation."</p> <p>It's not clear how quickly Achilles' complaint will get addressed though. An automatic reply email from the Special Counsel Tuesday said the Hatch Act Unit is out of office due to a lapse in appropriations.</p> <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service, did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment. But since the government shutdown last week, the agency has also had automated email responses with similar language. The agency's out of office emails and the website banners also read: President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel and clothe the American people.</p> <p>On Friday, the American Federation of Government Employees, a federal workers union, sued the U.S. Department of Education against similar automated emails from that agency, and sent a cease and desist letter.</p>
<p>Retired federal land managers say the language casts a chill over the work of civil servants, many of whom have already been targeted for layoffs or early retirement as part of the Trump administration's attempts to radically downsize the federal bureaucracy.</p> <p>Steve Ellis, a former deputy director of the Bureau of Land Management under the Obama administration, said blatantly partisan political messages have no place on agency websites.</p> <p>"In our careers, we have never seen anything like it," Ellis said in an email.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">These numbers show how 2 years of war have devastated Palestinian lives in Gaza</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>JERUSALEM — Numbers alone cannot capture the toll the Israel-Hamas war has taken on the Gaza Strip.</p> <p>But they can help us understand how thoroughly the conflict has upended the lives of 2.1 million Palestinians living in the territory and decimated the territory's 365 square kilometers (140 square miles).</p> <p>Out of every 10 people, one has been killed or injured in an Israeli strike. Nine are displaced. At least three have not eaten for days. Out of every 100 children, four have lost either one or both parents. Out of every 10 buildings that stood in Gaza prewar, eight are either damaged or flattened. Out of every 10 homes, nine are wrecked. Out of every 10 acres of cropland, eight are razed (more than three out of every four hectares).</p>
<p>The war began when Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza.</p> <p>In response, Israeli leaders promised a punishing offensive on the strip to annihilate Hamas and free the hostages.</p> <p>Here's a closer look at the devastation that followed, by the numbers.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Roughly 11% of Gaza's population has been killed or injured </h3> <p>Cemeteries are overflowing. Mass graves dot the strip. Israeli airstrikes have killed entire families in their homes. More than 2,000 people seeking food have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. In some cases Israel has acknowledged firing warning shots at chaotic crowds attempting to obtain desperately needed aid.</p> <p>Israeli attacks on health care facilities and limitations on the entry of medical supplies have left overwhelmed doctors to treat advanced burn victims with rudimentary equipment. Israel says it strikes hospitals because Hamas operates in them and uses them as command centers, though it has offered limited evidence. Hamas security personnel have been seen in hospitals and have kept some areas inaccessible. Israel has said restrictions on imports are needed to prevent Hamas from obtaining arms.</p> <p>The war is the deadliest conflict for journalists, health workers and U.N. aid workers in history, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists and the U.N. The British Medical Journal says the prevalence of patients with injuries from explosives in Gaza compares to data on injured U.S. combat forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Experts commissioned by a U.N. body and major rights groups have accused Israel of genocide, charges it vehemently denies.</p> <p>In all, Israel's campaign has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and wounded nearly 170,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. More than 40,000 of those wounded have life-altering injuries, according to the World Health Organization.</p> <p>The death toll does not include the thousands of people believed buried under the rubble. The ministry — part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals — does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. Its figures are seen as a reliable estimate by the U.N. and many independent experts.</p> <p>Israel blames Hamas for the high civilian toll, saying the group's presence in residential areas has turned the population into human shields. Still, its strikes often hit homes, killing many inside with no word of who the target was.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Nearly the entire population is displaced and thousands are missing</h3><h3 class="edTag"></h3> <p>Countless Palestinian families have fled the length of Gaza and back, forced to move every few months to dodge successive Israeli offensives. Many have been displaced multiple times, moving between apartments and makeshift tent camps as they try to survive. Squalid tent cities now sprawl across much of Gaza's south.</p> <p>Displacements have separated families. Heavy bombardment has left thousands buried under the rubble. Troops round up and detain men, from dozens to several hundreds at a time, searching for any they suspect of Hamas ties. The result is families split apart.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Israel occupies the vast majority of Gaza</h3> <p>Israel's military has gained control of the vast majority of Gaza, pushing most of the Palestinian population to a small zone along the southern coast. Under Israeli control, Gaza's land has been transformed. Forces have flattened or bulldozed entire neighborhoods of Gaza City and small agricultural towns dotting the border, carved new roads across the territory and built up new military posts.</p>
<p>Bombardment has carpeted the Gaza Strip in a blanket of rubble roughly 12 times the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Using imagery of Gaza from space, the U.N.'s Satellite Center says that at least 102,067 buildings have been destroyed. In the wreckage lie the ruins of grade schools and universities, medical clinics and mosques, greenhouses and family homes.</p> <h3 class="edTag">At least 30% of people go days without eating</h3> <p>Hundreds of Palestinians crowd charity kitchens jostling for a bowl of lentils. Babies are so emaciated they weigh less than at birth. After months of warnings from aid groups, the world's leading authority on food crises said in August that Gaza City had fallen into famine. Israel disputes the determination.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Towns have been leveled</h3> <p>Towns scattered across the strip, where Palestinian farmers used to plant strawberries and watermelons, wheat and cereals, are now emptied and flattened. Between May and October 2025, Israeli bombardment and demolitions virtually erased the town of Khuzaa, whose rows of wheat and other cereals made it a breadbasket for the city of Khan Younis.</p> <p>With the war entering its third year, Israel has launched an offensive to take over Gaza City and kill the Hamas militants it says are hiding there.</p> <p>Israel says it also aims to free the 48 hostages who remain in Gaza, about 20 of whom the government believes are alive. Since the war began, 465 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza.</p> <p>A new American peace plan is on the table, even as Israeli tanks and ground troops threaten the heart of Gaza City.</p>

<div class="article-title">White House floats no back pay for some furloughed federal workers despite 2019 law</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>President Trump is floating the possibility that some of the roughly 600,000 furloughed federal workers could be denied back pay once the government reopens, despite a 2019 law intended to ensure federal employees are compensated after a shutdown.</p> <p>Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump appeared to publicly back a draft White House memo that includes an argument for denying workers pay.</p> <p>"I would say it depends on who we're talking about," Trump said. "I can tell you this: The Democrats have put a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy, but it really depends on who you're talking about. But for the most part, we're going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we will take care of them in a different way."</p>
<p>When pressed on the legality of such a move, Trump said, "What the law says is correct, and I follow the law."</p>
<p>Trump was responding to questions about a draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by a senior White House official not authorized to discuss the memo, which has not been publicly circulated.</p> <p>The fight over federal worker pay is the latest salvo in the Trump administration's efforts to force Democrats to vote for a clean continuing resolution and drop their demands to extend health care subsidies for millions of Americans.</p> <p>The memo's legal argument contradicts guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management and the wording of a 2019 law signed by Trump during his first term that explicitly guarantees that federal workers "shall be paid" when a shutdown ends, whether they were furloughed or continued working.</p> <p>The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, a bipartisan law enacted after the record 35-day shutdown in 2018, added language to the Antideficiency Act that automatically applies back pay to federal employees for "any lapse in appropriations that begins on or after December 22, 2018."</p> <p>Previously, Congress had to approve retroactive funding after a shutdown with new legislation.</p>
<p>The White House memo notes a clause in the text that says workers shall be paid "at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates, and subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse" and argues that this means congressional action is required to enact back pay.</p>
<p>Guidance published by the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 30 did include a reference to the law's automatic restoration of pay.</p> <p>"The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates," the Sept. 30 memo reads. "Additional guidance for agencies on implementing Public Law 116-1 and treatment of pay and leave is available from OPM."</p> <p>A version updated on Oct. 3 removes those paragraphs.</p> <p>The draft memo is the latest in a multipronged pressure campaign from the White House seeking to punish Democrats during the shutdown, including efforts to cancel grant funding for energy projects and hold up transportation funding in states that did not vote for Trump in 2024. The administration has also threatened widespread reduction-in-force efforts at federal agencies, which have so far not materialized.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Congress responds</h3> <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that while he isn't extensively familiar with the plan and hasn't discussed it with the White House, it is possible there may be a legal justification for the draft. </p> <p>"There are legal analysts who think that is not something the government should do," Johnson said. "If that is true, that should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here."</p> <p>The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., argued that any interpretation to withhold back pay was "lawless." </p>
<p>"They're plotting to try and rob furloughed federal workers of back pay at the end of this shutdown," Murray said in remarks on the Senate floor. "This flies in the face of the plain text of the law, which could not be more clear."</p>

<div class="article-title">The government shutdown is snarling air travel. Officials say it could get worse</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.</p> <p>A dozen Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) facilities saw staffing shortages on Monday, according to an evening advisory from the agency.</p> <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy held a press conference at one of them, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, where he blamed the nationwide delays on a "slight tick-up in sick calls" by air traffic control workers.</p>
<p>Duffy said controllers are concerned about working without pay during the shutdown, with some considering taking on second jobs, like calling in sick to drive for Uber. And he warned that disruptions could worsen until the government reopens.</p> <p>"If we see there's issues in the tower that are affecting controllers' ability to effectively control the airspace, we'll reduce the rate, and you'll see more delays or you might see a cancellation," Duffy said. "I'm willing to do that before we're willing to risk anyone's life in the air."</p> <p>In a statement shared with NPR, the FAA says it "slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations" when there are increased staffing shortages. It directs travelers to its website for real-time flight impacts for every U.S. airport.</p> <p>Politicians on both sides of the aisle are blaming each other for the shutdown and ensuing travel snafus. The government shut down on Oct. 1 after partisan disagreements, largely over health care subsidies, prevented the Senate from passing a funding bill.</p>
<p>Air traffic controllers played a key role in ending the last government shutdown, which stretched on for 35 days, from December 2018 to January 2019.</p> <p>Only an FAA-described "slight increase" in sick leave at two air traffic control facilities threw major East Coast airports into chaos and increased pressure on the Trump administration to ultimately reach a spending deal with Congress.</p> <p>Long-standing controller staffing shortages — exacerbated by insufficient hiring, extensive training timelines and high dropout rates — have remained a problem in the years since. As Monday's events show, even a small number of sick calls can make a big impact.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Which airports were affected?</h3> <p>According to the FAA, Monday's delays affected air space across the country, including Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.</p> <p>The airports in Newark and Denver both saw ground delays due to staffing issues, according to the FAA. Flights were delayed an average of 53 minutes out of Newark and 39 minutes out of Denver, though some were held up by closer to two hours.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest disruptions were felt at Hollywood Burbank Airport near Los Angeles, which saw average ground delays of two and a half hours. It had no air traffic controllers for over five hours on Monday, according to California Gov. Gavin Newsom.</p> <p>Newsom blamed President Trump in a tweet, writing, "Burbank Airport has ZERO air traffic controllers from 4:15pm to 10pm today because of YOUR government shutdown."</p>
<p>A different aviation control facility, Southern California TRACON, ran operations remotely from San Diego during that period.</p> <p>Burbank Airport has not responded to NPR's request for comment. It said in a Monday night tweet that its operations were continuing, and urged travelers to check with their airlines about potential disruptions.</p> <h3 class="edTag">What are air traffic controllers saying? </h3> <p>At Duffy's Newark press conference, Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), specifically steered clear of politics as he called for an end to the shutdown.</p> <p>"We need to bring this shutdown to a close so that the Federal Aviation Administration and the committed aviation safety professionals can put this distraction aside and focus completely on their vital work," Daniels said.</p> <p>NATCA, which represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers, says many of its members were already working 10 hours a day, six days a week, and the shutdown has put them under further strain by furloughing safety support staff and suspending support programs.</p> <p>Its website has a notice warning its members that "participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service," saying such behavior is not only illegal but "also undermines NATCA's credibility."</p>
<p>In a statement to NPR, NATCA said nearly 11,000 fully certified controllers remain on the job, and it is normal for a few of them to call in sick on any given day.</p> <p>But it also says Monday's events underscore the fragility of the country's aviation system and the "urgent need to accelerate training and hiring."</p> <p>Since the start of the second Trump administration, Duffy has pushed for an overhaul of the country's air traffic control systems — parts of which still rely on floppy disks and run Windows 95 — and prioritized efforts to "supercharge" hiring.</p>
<p>Duffy said Monday that the shutdown hampers those efforts, now and potentially in the future.</p> <p>"It has a longer-lasting impact on our ability to make up the ground in the shortages that we have right now with air traffic controllers," he said. "This is having great impact … on our system at a time when we're trying to reduce the stress."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">How else could the shutdown affect air travel? </h3> <p>The government shutdown could also have steep consequences for rural airports.</p> <p>Duffy warned that the Essential Air Service (EAS), a federal program that subsidizes commercial service to rural airports in about 170 U.S. communities, could run out of funding as soon as Sunday.</p> <p>"Every state across the country will be impacted by the inability to provide the subsidies to airlines to service these communities," Duffy said, adding that Alaska will be the hardest hit.</p>
<p>The White House proposed slashing the program's funds by more than 50% earlier this year, despite the fact that it has longstanding, bipartisan support in Congress, as Duffy himself acknowledged on Monday.</p> <p>Natasha Marquez, a spokesperson for the Regional Airline Association, told NPR in a statement that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the EAS supported more than 17,000 U.S. jobs and enabled the operation of hundreds of daily flights from airports with an average distance of 200 miles from the nearest medium or large hub airport — meaning many travelers could feel the impacts.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Alaska Airlines, which holds contracts for six communities in Alaska, told NPR over email that if the government shutdown continues beyond Sunday, "we would be relieved of our obligations as an EAS provider to those communities and the [Department of Transportation] would likely suspend reimbursements."</p> <p>It is not immediately clear when passengers would notice a change. Airlines typically seek reimbursement from the government at the start of the month for the previous month's flights, according to the Department of Transportation.</p>

<div class="article-title">Babies take a lesson from soldiers in the war against malaria</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Babies may soon join soldiers in the fight to ward off malaria.</p> <p>For years, the U.S. military has treated uniforms with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and the malaria they can transmit. Ross Boyce used to wear one before becoming an infectious disease physician and malaria researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p> <p>He wondered if babies could get similar protection – not from a uniform but by treating the baby wraps that many moms in sub-Saharan Africa use to carry their little ones.</p> <p>"It seems sort of an obvious thing to do," he says, especially given the risk — nearly every minute, a child under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria. Plus, existing tools like insecticide-treated bed nets can only protect kids while they're sleeping.</p>
<p>So Boyce and his colleagues tested this idea in a large randomized controlled trial. In a rural part of western Uganda, 200 mothers with kids between 6 and 18 months got a permethrin-soaked baby wrap, while 200 others got a wrap just soaked in water. All participants got a brand-new treated bed net too.</p> <p>Over the course of 6 months, the young participants visited clinics every two weeks to be checked for malaria symptoms and tested. The team also looked for side effects. Every four weeks, the researchers re-soaked the wraps in case the permethrin wore off. "That was probably overkill," says Boyce. "But we really wanted to know, if we have enough permethrin in there, does it work?"</p> <p>The answer: a resounding yes. "It was a level of effect that was beyond even our wildest expectations," says Boyce.</p> <p>Over 6 months, 34 kids in the permethrin-wrap group tested positive for malaria, compared with 94 in the water-soaked wrap group, a reduction of about 65%.</p> <p>"It's a really large reduction, surprisingly so," says Thomas Eisele, a malaria researcher at Tulane University who wasn't involved in the study. The scale of the reduction suggests mosquitoes are biting more often than thought during the daytime, he says.</p> <p>"We've hit a brick wall where we just weren't making progress with our existing tools," says Eisele. "These types of interventions are going to be critical."</p>
<p>The major reductions didn't seem to come with major side effects over the course of the experiment, which was a worry. Permethrin can cause growth and neurological problems if ingested at high levels.</p> <p>"When [permethrin] is treated on fabric, there's much less transmission through the skin," he says.<strong> </strong>Plus, kids were generally clothed underneath the wrap, so there wasn't much direct contact. Still, about 8.5% of babies had a mild rash in the treatment group compared with 6% in the control.</p> <p>"Nothing is zero risk, and it's a tradeoff that needs to be considered," he says, "but we know getting malaria is not good for children either."</p>
<p>In the real world, retreating the wraps as often as they did during the experiment could be impractical, says Boyce. But it also may not be necessary since manufacturers are able to create long-lasting permethrin-treated garments.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Down the line, Boyce imagines mothers could get a long-lasting wrap when they come to clinics to get vaccines, providing some extra protection before the babies start walking around on their own.</p> <p>However the rollout might work, demand would be high, predicts study co-author Edgar Mulogo, a researcher at Mbara University in Uganda. "The excitement to use [the wraps] was just tremendous," he says. He heard one participant say "when the children were under the wraps, they were not getting bitten."</p>

<p><em>Good morning. You're reading the Up First newsletter. </em>Subscribe<em> here to get it delivered to your inbox, and </em>listen<em> to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.</em></p> <h3 class="edTag">Today's top stories</h3> <p><strong>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last night tweeted an image of troops boarding a military plane</strong>, providing an update on President Trump's use of the Texas National Guard. Abbott stated in the post that the troops were "deploying now," but didn't provide additional details of where they were going. Trump has called for the Texas Guard to head to cities led by Democratic mayors, including Portland, Ore. and Chicago. The president says the cities have high crime rates, but elected officials in the cities say this move is a threat to state independence.</p>
<ul class="edTag"><li>🎧 <strong>Trump said that if he wanted to use the Insurrection Act</strong>, which gives a president the authority to use federal troops to calm civil unrest in a crisis and engage in law enforcement-like activities, he would. Instead of invoking the Act, the White House is using Section 12-406 of Title 10, an obscure provision of federal law, to claim authority to bring in National Guard troops, NPR's Jaclyn Diaz tells <em>Up First</em>. The law allows the president to call up the Guard if there's "a rebellion" or danger of one happening against the federal government or the possibility of a foreign invasion. The use of this law has yielded mixed results, as seen in Portland, where a judge rejected the Trump administration's claim that federal intervention was needed to manage anti-ICE protests.</li></ul>
<p><strong>The Supreme Court hears a case today about the government's ability to regulate conversion therapy.</strong> The practice is generally defined as a method to change a person's same-sex attraction, essentially aiming to make a gay person straight. The case pits conservative Christians, who support the practice and say a ban would violate free speech, against the LGBTQ+ community. <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>🎧 <strong>Every major medical association has repudiated conversion therapy</strong>, finding that it doesn't work and leads to depression and suicidal thoughts in minors, according to NPR's Nina Totenberg. Due to the findings, half of states have banned the practice for those under 18 years old. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group, is challenging the ban, saying it violates the free speech rights of therapists in talk therapy. Lawyer James Campbell, a plaintiff in the case, says the state can determine if a therapist has the right education, but cannot dictate the perspective a therapist takes when they talk about a certain subject.</li></ul> <p><strong>Today marks two full years since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. </strong>In Gaza, the anniversary marks the start of a third year of the deadliest and most destructive war the enclave has been subject to. In Israel, people have not been able to move on from the day, as 48 hostages remain in Gaza. <br/></p>
<ul class="edTag"><li>🎧<strong> Yesterday, NPR's Emily Feng, who is in Tel Aviv, went to a commemoration event in the Kibbutz of Nir Oz</strong>, one of the communities hardest hit by the impacts of Oct. 7. She says people there are still grieving and angry about the Israeli military leaving them undefended on that day. Rotam Cooper, the son of a man who was kidnapped by Hamas and died in captivity, says his community feels like the government abandoned them not once but twice. Feng expressed how the community feels Israel has not done enough to get the hostages back, and this has left the country divided when it comes to the war. NPR's Anas Baba, who is in Gaza, spoke to Ahmed Abu Saif, who says that within the last two years, his life went from going to university to being displaced and worrying about his family's lives.</li><li>➡️ <strong>Since the Oct. 7 attack, at least 220 journalists have been killed in Gaza.</strong> War reporters play a crucial role in documenting history, but reaching the front lines to report the truth is challenging.

<p><em>Living Better is a </em><em>special series</em><em> about what it takes to stay healthy in America.</em></p> <p>Women, on average, outlive men by around five years. However, a new study, published in the journal <em>Science Advances</em>, shows men could narrow that gap. This lifespan difference has been discovered across different species, according to a new study from researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. A mix of factors, including genetics, mating habits and caregiving responsibilities, explains the gap. Here's an overview of what impacts men's lives: <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>👫 Men tend to engage in riskier behaviors, like smoking and drinking, at higher rates. Men have been more likely to smoke tobacco, leading to a higher risk of lung cancer.</li><li>👫 Men are less likely to protect themselves from the sun. Only 12.3% of men always wear sunscreen when they spend over an hour outside on sunny days, according to a survey published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.</li><li>👫 The Max Planck study indicates that the sex that invests more time in the care of offspring tends to live longer. The evolutionary reasoning is that the caregiver parent needs to survive until their offspring are independent.</li></ul><h3 class="edTag">From our hosts</h3>
<p>by <strong>Leila Fadel</strong>, <em>Morning Edition </em>and <em>Up First </em>host</p> <p><strong>Just over a week after the October 7, 2023, attack</strong>, I walked through a once manicured Kibbutz in southern Israel on the border with Gaza. The landscape told the horrors of that Hamas-led attack. I surveyed burned-out homes, two unmade children's beds with bloodstained sheets and saferooms where families had cowered.</p> <p>The bodies of those who'd been killed there had been taken away for burial. The rest of the community was evacuated for safety. But I, along with other journalists, was given access to tell the stories of the terror of that day, to name the nearly 1,200 victims and the more than 250 hostages, and to learn who they were in life and the awful way they were killed or taken.</p>
<p>Where I stood, I could hear Israel's punishing response to this attack well underway just a few miles away in Gaza. I could see the plumes of smoke. But I wasn't allowed inside to witness who was being killed and how, to name the dead or to see the destruction. International press was barred from reporting inside independently, so we depended and still depend on our Palestinian colleagues, some of whom have now been killed. At that point, Israel had ordered a complete siege of Gaza, which it could do because it unilaterally controls nearly every border and the water. Along the Sinai, Israel coordinates that control with Egypt. No food, water or electricity would be allowed in for a time.</p> <p>At that time, nearly 3,000 Palestinians had already been killed. That was almost two years ago.</p> <p>I never imagined that today I, along with all international press, would still have no access to report independently in Gaza. I never imagined that the number of Palestinians killed would surpass 66,000 people — so many of them children, according to health authorities there. I never imagined that I would hear UNICEF report that 28 children were being killed a day in Gaza — the equivalent of a classroom. I would become familiar with the term WCNSF: Wounded Child No Surviving Family.</p>
<p>I didn't think I'd be looking at aerial images of neighborhoods, hospitals and roads all obliterated as the world and the American public's deep sympathy began to sour over Israel's prosecution of its war … especially after images of starving children began to emerge this year and a famine was declared in parts of Gaza because aid was being blocked from entry.</p> <p>Right now, Hamas and Israel are negotiating a 20-point peace plan from Trump's administration. It could stop the Israeli bombardment and killing in Gaza. It could force Hamas to finally release the last 48 Israeli hostages it still holds, some dead and some alive.</p> <p>But then what? Who rebuilds? Is the air, filled with chemicals of war, death and debris, safe to breathe? Who will be discovered under the rubble? Will the far right in Israel win out and push Palestinians out of Gaza? Will Hamas abdicate any role in the future governance of Palestinians? Will an actual solution emerge that is free of occupation, as Palestinians want? Will it guarantee security and safety, as Israelis want? What will come out of all of this horror?</p> <p>Those are the questions on my mind as this deal is being negotiated, as this day is marked. In the meantime, we tell you the stories of the Israelis and Palestinians who have paid a price that no one should.</p> <h3 class="edTag">3 things to know before you go</h3>

<div class="article-title">Sen. Jeanne Shaheen: Lawmakers must find 'common ground' to end the government shutdown</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>On the seventh day of the government shutdown, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., called on Republicans and her fellow Democrats to find a way forward while warning of consequences for the nation's health care system.</p> <p>President Trump on social media said earlier Monday he's willing to work with Democrats on health care, but only after the government reopens.</p> <p>When asked on <em>Morning Edition</em> whether anyone from the administration had reached out to her directly, Shaheen said, "No one from the administration." She added that she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to "find common ground."</p>
<p>She framed the negotiations as a realistic effort to reopen the government without sacrificing consumer protections and access to care.</p> <p>Shaheen is not seeking reelection in 2026. The veteran appropriator has long opposed shutdowns and helped broker past bipartisan deals. But negotiations have stalled, as Democrats and Republicans tussle over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces that are due to expire at the end of the year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as four million people risk becoming uninsured if the credits are not renewed.</p> <p>The current stakes are high. "We ought to be able to reopen the government and make sure we're not kicking four million people off of their health insurance," she said, adding that this "has real ramifications for the entire health care system."</p> <p>With health insurers finalizing premiums in October and open enrollment starting Nov. 1, Shaheen warned that millions could "lose their health insurance."</p> <p>In her home state, she said four medical facilities face closure due to spending cuts in the sweeping tax and spending bill passed by Republicans and signed by Trump over the summer.</p> <p>Shaheen called Trump's signature bill a "big betrayal of the American people" and said its impacts need to be addressed. The Democrats' proposal in the Senate includes provisions to reverse some of those spending cuts — a demand Republicans have not supported.</p>
<p>She also pushed back sharply on administration arguments that layoffs are inevitable during a shutdown, calling that narrative "disingenuous."</p>
<p>"From Day One, this administration started firing federal employees," she said, and named the Food and Drug Administration and the Veterans Administration, which she says had to rehire staff.</p> <p>"It is totally inaccurate for this administration to claim that it's the shutdown that's causing them to fire people. It's the shutdown that's giving them more of an excuse, but this has been happening from Day One."</p> <p>Despite tensions and mistrust between the two major parties, Shaheen remained resolute about seeking a bipartisan path forward.</p> <p>"We ought to all be able to agree that the people who need this help the most are the ones who ought to get it," she said. "I think more and more people are recognizing that, yes, there is some real common ground that we should be able to find."</p> <p>With the shutdown's effects mounting, she added, "That's why we need to work together to get this open."</p> <p><em>The digital version of this interview was edited by Obed Manuel, Jason Breslow and Luis Clemens.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Deploying troops to Chicago is not legally justified, says Illinois attorney general</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>President Trump argues the National Guard is needed in Chicago — a city that had its fewest summer murders in 60 years — because it is overrun with crime.</p> <p>But the conditions to legally justify troop deployments in Chicago simply don't exist, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul told <em>Morning Edition</em>. The state filed a lawsuit Monday against the Trump administration in which it argues that the Illinois National Guard can only be federalized if there is a foreign invasion, rebellion or if the federal government is unable to enforce federal laws.</p> <p>The only "agitation" and "chaos" in and around Chicago, Raoul said, is from "[Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and Border Patrol firing pepper gas at civilians, journalists," and "even Chicago police officers."</p>
<p>For weeks, the Trump administration has carried out aggressive immigration enforcement in Chicago, including a recent raid of an apartment building during which agents pulled residents, including children, out of their homes and detained some U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>The actions have led to tense standoffs between protestors and federal agents. A Border Patrol agent shot a woman in the city's southwest side last week. Agents claimed the woman was armed and that she and other protestors were using cars to box in agents, WBEZ reports.</p> <p>Raoul told NPR's Steve Inskeep that it is evident the Trump administration's actions against Chicago are "political in nature." Trump has vowed for weeks to clean up crime in Chicago, though the city has experienced a decline in most major crime categories this year, according to WBEZ.</p> <p>Last month, Trump said he would "love to have" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker call the White House to make a formal request for troops. The president also posted on Truth Social last month that the city was going to find out "why it's called the Department of WAR."</p> <p>"All of these communications coming from the president and members of his administration demonstrate that this is about political targeting, not about conditions on the ground in Chicago or anywhere in the state of Illinois," Raoul said.</p> <p>In an emailed statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said "Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities."</p>
<p>A federal judge did not immediately block the Trump administration from deploying troops to Chicago as Illinois requested in its lawsuit — including the deployment of some troops from Texas and other states. Oral arguments in that suit are set for Thursday.</p> <p>Richard Hayes, who served as former Illinois National Guard Adjutant General — its highest ranking member — said in an interview with <em>Morning Edition</em> if and when troops are deployed, the public should know there are things soldiers are or aren't supposed to do.</p>
<p>"All soldiers — sailors, airmen, Marines, space guardians — they have a duty to follow legal orders just as much as they have a duty to not follow illegal ones. So you're duty-bound either direction," Hayes said.</p> <p>But Raoul said troop deployment is still cause for alarm because these are not "normal times."</p> <p>"I don't have any negative feelings about National Guardsmen when they're serving their country, but it's how they're being directed that I'm concerned about," Raoul said.</p> <p>On the prospect of Illinois' lawsuit being appealed all the way to a Trump friendly Supreme Court and troops being deployed in Chicago, Raoul said "that would be a very dangerous thing to occur."</p> <p>"It's un-American. This is not what we expect in our country, to be subject to military deploying in our streets to do civilian law enforcement work," Raoul continued "It's not what we do in the United States of America."</p> <p><em>This digital article was edited by Treye Green.
