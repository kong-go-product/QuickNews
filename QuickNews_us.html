<div class="article-title">Federal judge blocks Trump's National Guard deployment to Portland amid constitutional challenge</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A federal judge blocked President Donald Trump’s efforts to deploy National Guard troops into Portland in a late-night decision on Sunday.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled the action was unlawful and unconstitutional, issuing an emergency temporary restraining order to halt the deployment of California’s National Guard. The order also bars the use of troops from any other state or Washington, D.C. in Oregon.</p><p>Immergut’s ruling says that the Trump administration’s action violates federal statute 10 U.S.C. §12406 and the Tenth Amendment.</p><p>"It appears to violate both 10 U.S.C. §12406 and the Tenth Amendment," Immergut said during the proceeding, according to reporting from Adam Klasfeld of AllRise News.</p><p>Immergut also pressed Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton on why the DOJ continued to pursue troop movements.</p><p>"How could bringing in federalized National Guard from California not be in direct contravention of the TRO that I issued yesterday?" she asked."You’re an officer of the court. Aren’t defendants circumventing my order?"</p><p>Hamilton went on to deny any wrongdoing but did offer a defense to which Immergut pushed back.</p><p>"You have to have a colorable claim that Oregon conditions warrant deploying the National Guard — you don’t."</p><p>Oregon’s Scott Kennedy said it felt like "a game of rhetorical Whac-A-Mole" and referenced reports that Trump may be considering sending Texas National Guard troops to Chicago.</p><p>DOJ representatives requested a stay, but Immergut denied both the stay and the administrative delay, saying it was an "emergency" and there were no new facts to justify the request to change her previous ruling.</p><p>"I’m handling this on an emergency basis with limited briefing," she said. "No new information has been provided about any new issues in Portland."</p><p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) immediately took to X to boast.</p><p>"BREAKING: We just won in court — again. A federal judge BLOCKED Donald Trump’s unlawful attempt to DEPLOY 300 OF OUR NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO PORTLAND. The court granted our request for a Temporary Restraining Order — HALTING ANY FEDERALIZATION, RELOCATION, OR DEPLOYMENT of ANY GUARD MEMBERS TO OREGON FROM ANY STATE. Trump’s abuse of power won’t stand," the post stated.</p><p>The Justice Department has made indications that it will be appealing the ruling with arguments that the president retains authority under federal law to deploy National Guard forces in cases of "domestic unrest."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Drake Maye leads Patriots to upset victory over previously undefeated Bills</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The New England Patriots made sure every team in the NFL had a loss this season, as they pulled off the upset against the Buffalo Bills in a 23-20 win on the road on Sunday night. </p><p>After the Denver Broncos defeated the Philadelphia Eagles earlier on Sunday, the Bills were the only remaining undefeated team in the NFL. But Drake Maye and the Patriots came into their AFC East battle with confidence and the right answer for Josh Allen on the defensive side of the ball. </p><p>It wasn’t the best start for either team in terms of execution as we had back-to-back fumbles in the first quarter after Allen and Dawson Knox’s handoff fell to the turf. But the Patriots gave it right back as Rhamondre Stevenson, who has had trouble fumbling early this season, was stripped after catching a pass from Maye. </p><p>After multiple punts, Keon Coleman, Allen’s trusty wide receiver, uncharacteristically fumbled later in the first quarter as well. Buffalo was also being penalized during their drives, constantly killing momentum. </p><p>The Patriots finally got on the board first with a field goal in the first quarter, which Matt Prater of the Bills followed up on in the second quarter. There were no touchdowns by either team in the first half, though the Patriots owned a 6-3 lead entering the locker room. </p><p>Both offenses would turn it up in the second half, though, and it began when the Bills used its opening drive to take a 10-6 lead after Curtis Samuel went untouched on a short pass from Allen into the end zone. </p><p>However, Maye had the answer for the Bills, and needed just five plays to do so thanks to a 32-yard catch by Stefon Diggs, who was the game’s leading receiver in his return to Buffalo, a city he was so beloved in for years as Allen’s favorite target. Diggs finished the game with 146 yards on 10 catches. </p><p>Stevenson got into the end zone to retake the lead, and the Patriots’ defense once again came through with a turnover to keep momentum on their side. On the ensuing drive, Allen was moving downfield when Marcus Jones jumped a pass intended for Khalil Shakir and intercepted the Bills’ star to flip the field. </p><p>Maye used that turnover to go 90 yards on 11 plays, capped by Stevenson’s second touchdown of the night to take a 20-10 lead early in the fourth quarter. </p><p>But, as we’ve seen so many times in the past, Allen responded when his team needed to do so. Keon Coleman ran his play-action route perfectly from the New England two-yard line and he was uncovered for a short pass from Allen to make it a three-point game. </p><p>After getting a stop on the ensuing Patriots drive, Allen had the chance for another touchdown drive to perhaps win the game. But a stellar pass deflection by Christian Gonzalez on third-and-10 made Prater try a field goal just to tie the game. </p><p>So, instead of Allen going down the field for the win, it was Maye. With 2:17 left on the clock, Maye was calm as he found Diggs and Keyshon Boutte for chunk yardage as they got into field goal range for rookie Andy Borregales out of Miami. </p><p>From 52 yards out, Borregales’ first nail-biting kick couldn’t have gone better, as he split the uprights right down the middle to take the lead with 15 seconds left to play. That was the game, as the Bills were out of timeouts and couldn’t get the clock on their side. </p><p>In the box score, Maye was 22-of-30 for 273 yards, while a modest 71 yards rushing from the team was seen. For the Bills, Allen went 22-of-31 for 253 yards with two touchdowns and one interception with Dalton Kincaid his leading receiver with 108 yards on six catches. </p><p>The Patriots held James Cook in check throughout the night, too, as he had just 49 yards on 15 rush attempts. Allen led Buffalo in the run game with 53 yards on nine carries. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Bills fan snags Josh Allen's errant pass, immediately leaves with football</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Buffalo Bills fan saw his opportunity for a once-in-a-lifetime souvenir – and took it.</p><p>Josh Allen was leading the Bills down the field on the opening drive of the second half against the New England Patriots on Sunday night. On the Patriots’ 6-yard line, Allen rolled to his right looking for an open receiver. Instead, he threw the ball into the back of the end zone.</p><p>A Bills fan in a Matt Milano jersey caught the ball and immediately ran from his seat at Highmark Stadium up the stairs, presumably looking for the exit. The moment stunned NBC broadcaster Mike Tirico, who wondered where the man was going with the football. Stadium ushers around the fan didn’t attempt to stop him from leaving.</p><p>Like Tirico said, the fan missed the touchdown pass from Allen to Curtis Samuel on the next play. The score gave Buffalo a 10-6 lead at the time. </p><p>Buffalo lost the game, 23-20.</p><p>It’s the second odd moment involving Bills fans at Highmark Stadium during the season so far.</p><p>During the first Sunday night game of the year, a Bills fan hit Baltimore Ravens star DeAndre Hopkins on the helmet following a touchdown celebration. Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson responded by pushing the fan back into their seat.</p><p>The fan was reportedly banned indefinitely from Highmark Stadium and other NFL venues.</p><p>Allen needled Bills fans for leaving early that night as they completed a comeback victory against the Ravens. The star quarterback probably wouldn’t blame Sunday’s fan for getting out of the building fast with the football.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Nicole Kidman makes first public appearance since Keith Urban divorce filing</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Nicole Kidman put on a brave face Saturday, just days after she filed for divorce from Keith Urban.</p><p>The Oscar-winning actress was on hand to present Taylor Sheridan with the Award of Inspiration at the amfAR Dallas Gala. </p><p>Kidman, 58, rocked a long black gown for her first public appearance following the end of her 19-year marriage with Urban, 57.</p><p>The "Let It Roll" singer was seen on Thursday ahead of his gig at the Giant Center in Hershey as part of his "High and Alive" tour. Urban was seen without his wedding band in the pictures.</p><p>Days before Kidman filed for divorce from Urban, Maggie Baugh — a 25-year-old country star who is currently on tour with Urban and his band — posted an eyebrow-raising video from a recent show that left fans questioning the nature of her relationship with the country star. </p><p>"When they’re tryna get to you, Maggie, I’ll be your guitar player," Urban sang onstage — replacing the original line, "When they’re tryna get to you, baby, I’ll be the fighter."</p><p>She wrote in her caption, "Did he just say that," accompanied by the eyes emoji.</p><p>However, according to People, Urban often ad-libs when performing the song live. For example, while singing "The Fighter" with Carrie Underwood at the 2017 CMT Music Awards, he interjected, "Carrie Underwood, I'm gonna be your fighter!"</p><p>While an insider confirmed to Fox News Digital that there have been whispers of another woman, TMZ was first to report that the country star may already be involved with someone else, with a source close to Kidman saying, "All the signs point to the fact Keith is with another woman. Let's just say Nicole doesn't dispute that, but she's still shocked over it."</p><p>Another source claimed to the outlet the news of Urban's rumored new fling is "all over Nashville."</p><p>On Sept. 30, Kidman filed for divorce from Urban, ending 19 years of marriage. She cited "irreconcilable differences" and ongoing "marital difficulties," according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital.</p><p>Kidman listed Sept. 30 as the couple’s date of separation.</p><p>In the filing, the "Big Little Lies" star asked to be named the primary residential parent of the couple’s two daughters, Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret. Additionally, she petitioned the court to approve a parenting plan for their daughters, which allocated 306 days per year with her and 59 days each year with Urban.</p><p>The former couple were last publicly seen together in June at a FIFA Club World Cup match in Nashville between Los Angeles Football Club and Esperance de Tunis. The Oscar-winning actress first met Urban in 2005 at an event in Australia. One year later, the couple married in Sydney.</p><p>Before tying the knot with Urban, Kidman was married to actor Tom Cruise, whom she met on the set of "Days of Thunder." The former couple adopted two children together — Isabella and Connor — before divorcing in 2001.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Christina Dugan Ramirez contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>FBI Director Kash Patel promised justice after two suspects allegedly rammed a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agent's vehicle amid growing unrest across the country.</p><p>The suspects, Marimar Martinez and Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, were described by DHS as being domestic terrorists who "ambushed" agents in Chicago on Saturday.</p><p>Martinez was armed with a semi-automatic weapon and "ha[d] a history of doxxing federal agents," the DHS said in a release.</p><p>"She took defensive fire from CBP agents and has been discharged from the hospital and is currently in the custody of the FBI," the statement said. </p><p>"The driver of another vehicle, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, involved in the ramming has been apprehended by law enforcement."</p><p>In a post on Sunday evening, Patel said that officials "just arrested two individuals who were allegedly driving these vehicles and attacking our federal law enforcement officers."</p><p>"They have been charged for assaulting federal officers with a deadly or dangerous weapon," Patel added.</p><p>"Attack our law enforcement, and this FBI will find you and bring you to justice."</p><p>A source from the FBI told Fox News Digital that the cases are being treated as AFOs, or assaults on federal officers.</p><p>The source added that Martinez and Santos Ruiz are being prosecuted under Title 18, U.S. Code, Sections 111(a) and (b), which make it a federal crime to forcibly assault, resist or impede a federal officer while that officer is performing official duties.</p><p>In the DHS release, officials noted that the scene became "increasingly violent as more domestic terrorists gathered and began throwing smoke, gas, rocks, and bottles at DHS law enforcement."</p><p>"Another domestic terrorist was arrested for assaulting CBP at the scene," the statement added. "Following JB Prtizker’s refusal to allow local police to help secure the scene, Secretary Noem has deployed special operations teams to restore law and order."</p><p>Two suspects were arrested in similar incidents in Chicagoland on Friday. The suspects, Miguel Escareno De Loera and Widman Osberto Lopez-Funes, were both accused of weaponizing their vehicles in "deliberate attempts to ram and injure" ICE officers, according to officials.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker announced on Sunday that President Donald Trump will deploy 400 members of the Texas National Guard to Illinois, Oregon and other locations.</p><p>The deployment came as protests against federal law enforcement ramp up across the country, particularly in Portland and Chicago.</p><p>In the Windy City, multiple people were arrested in recent days for reportedly ramming their vehicles into DHS and ICE agents' cars.</p><p>After announcing Trump's deployment on X late Sunday, Pritzker wrote that "no officials from the federal government called me directly to discuss or coordinate."</p><p>"We must now start calling this what it is: Trump’s Invasion," the Democratic governor wrote.</p><p> "It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state’s military troops."</p><p>Pritzker also disclosed that he called Texas Governor Greg Abbot to "immediately withdraw any support for this decision and refuse to coordinate."</p><p>"There is no reason a President should send military troops into a sovereign state without their knowledge, consent, or cooperation," the governor added.</p><p>"The brave men and women who serve in our national guards must not be used as political props. This is a moment where every American must speak up and help stop this madness."</p><p>In response, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott defended his decision, writing on X that he had "fully authorized the President to call up 400 members of the Texas National Guard to ensure safety for federal officials."</p><p>He then added that federal and state leaders must "either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let the Texas Guard do it," while praising the Guard’s "training, skill and expertise."</p><p>Abbott also noted that thousands of Texas National Guard troops have remained along the southern border to assist with security operations.</p><p>In recent days, large numbers of protesters have rioted against immigration enforcement actions across the country. ICE shared a video of a Portland protester being wheeled into custody on Sunday.</p><p>In Broadview, Illinois, on Friday, more than a dozen people were arrested by federal agents during protests at an ICE processing facility. Agents were seen firing pepper balls, tear gas and rubber bullets to clear crowds.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">National police union calls Chicago's refusal to help ICE agents 'shocking' violation of duty</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The nation’s largest police union condemned reports that Chicago officers were told not to help ICE agents surrounded by protesters, calling it "shocking" and a violation of law enforcement’s duty to protect fellow officers in danger.</p><p>Presidents of the National Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) and Illinois State FOP expressed shock at reports that Chicago's chief of patrol directed officers not to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents as they were surrounded by protesters on Saturday.</p><p>"Details are still emerging, but it appears that officers from the Chicago Police Department were ordered not to assist a group of ICE agents while they were physically threatened by what appeared to be an angry mob," said National FOP President Patrick Yoes in a press release. "Let me be clear, both the National FOP and the Illinois FOP believe that when an officer calls for assistance, you answer, no matter what."</p><p>Yoes and Illinois State FOP President Chris Southwood said the directive violated the most basic principle of law enforcement — officers helping other officers in danger.</p><p>They cited the Illinois Trust Act, which limits local police involvement in immigration enforcement, and said it is contributing to a breakdown between local and federal law enforcement, particularly in sanctuary cities like Chicago.</p><p>The FOP also cited Department of Homeland Security data showing ICE agents have faced a 1,000% increase in violence since the start of the year.</p><p>Southwood called the alleged order a dangerous precedent for all law enforcement officers.</p><p>"The number one unwritten rule in law enforcement is that we respond to any calls from officers in distress," Southwood said. "What would have happened if the local police were facing threats and nearby federal officers were told not to assist? Whether you agree about immigration enforcement or not, when a law enforcement officer is in trouble, nothing should stand in the way of fellow officers rendering assistance."</p><p>Yoes echoed Southwood, stressing that it is more important than ever for police officers to band together to protect their brothers and sisters who wear the badge.</p><p>"We at the National FOP, as well as our members at the Illinois FOP, condemn these actions and urge Chicago officials to ensure that any law enforcement officer needing assistance is guaranteed that their brothers and sisters in law enforcement respond expeditiously," Yoes said.</p><p>Their comments followed Fox News’ report revealing that Chicago police officers were ordered by their chief of patrol not to respond after Border Patrol agents called for help, saying they were boxed in and surrounded following a ramming incident outside the city, according to multiple federal and Chicago law enforcement sources.</p><p>Fox News reviewed the computer-aided dispatch message sent to Chicago police officers by their chief of patrol. It instructed officers not to respond to a Saturday morning ramming incident on the southwest side of the city in which an armed woman was shot and agents were boxed in and surrounded.</p><p>The Chicago Police Department issued a statement on Sunday disputing claims that officers failed to respond, saying they were on the scene to maintain public safety and document the incident.</p><p>"To clarify misinformation currently circulating, CPD officers did in fact respond to the shooting scene involving federal authorities on Saturday to maintain public safety and traffic control," the department said.</p><p>CPD added that federal authorities are leading the investigation into the shooting, but that officers were present to ensure safety. Later that afternoon, police also responded to a separate call involving two hit-and-run crashes affecting federal personnel, the department said.</p><p>"The Chicago Police Department will always respond to anyone who is being attacked or is under the threat of physical harm," the department said.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Washington, D.C. police officers are alleging to the Justice Department that superiors misclassified crimes to make reported statistics look less serious than the reality, according to a Washington Post report.</p><p>Roughly three dozen rank-and-file officers and detectives have lodged complaints with the DOJ as the city faces an investigation into whether crime statistics were intentionally misreported under the Trump administration. In August, President Donald Trump deployed the National Guard to D.C., citing a need to combat "crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor."</p><p>Trump declared that the effort "will go further," saying the administration was "starting very strongly with D.C." and promising, "we’re going to clean it up real quick."</p><p>"It’s becoming a situation of complete and total lawlessness," Trump said at an August 11 press conference, describing the city’s crime conditions as "embarrassing."</p><p>According to officers, MPD leadership has for months — and in some cases years — instructed subordinates to downgrade serious offenses. Some precinct-level reports are said to have contained as many as 150 potentially misclassified incidents in the Southeast D.C. Seventh District alone. In about half of those cases, supervisors later upgraded the charges. </p><p>While city leaders and Democrats point to data showing violent crime is at a 30-year low, the DOJ and House Oversight are probing whether those numbers are being masked by internal manipulation. </p><p>The DOJ’s criminal probe is being run out of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro’s office. </p><p>One area of scrutiny is a new offense category not currently included in D.C.’s violent crime tallies: endangerment with a firearm, which applies when a gun is fired but intent to harm is unclear. Officers say many shootings not resulting in injuries are being relabeled under that category.</p><p>When asked for comment, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, MPD, and the D.C. Police Union did not immediately respond.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Toronto Blue Jays were leaning on Trey Yesavage to keep the New York Yankees’ bats quiet in Game 2 of the ALDS in just his fourth career big-league start. He didn’t just keep them quiet — he dominated them and made MLB history in the process.</p><p>Yesavage became the first pitcher in MLB history with 11 strikeouts while allowing no hits through the first five innings of a playoff game, leading the way for Toronto to take a commanding 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series with a 13-7 victory.</p><p>The Rogers Centre, much like it was on Saturday in Game 1 of the series, was rocking with a sold-out crowd that came alive the second Yesavage struck out Trent Grisham to open the game. He proceeded to strike out Cody Bellinger and Ben Rice to finish off his first frame, showcasing a wicked fastball-splitter combo thrown from a rare over-the-top arm slot.</p><p>Yesavage continued to conquer bats like Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton and others in the Yankees’ lineup, which was the highest-scoring in MLB this season.</p><p>Fox Sports’ Ken Rosenthal found Yesavage’s parents, Dave and Cheryl, in the Rogers Centre stands to discuss their son’s incredible outing.</p><p>"I was hoping that he would do well, but I never expected this, especially against the Yankees. Being that we’re from outside Philadelphia and we’re Phillies fans, the Yankees have not been our top team. This is amazing. He did a great job," Cheryl said.</p><p>Dave added, "He went to work, he did his job. He knows what his job is, and he is not in a better fan base than right here in Toronto with all of these fans right here."</p><p>Yesavage’s mother said he was "born" with a calm temperament, one that was clearly on display in a high-pressure start in the MLB postseason.</p><p>In the end, Yesavage’s line read no hits and 11 strikeouts over 5⅓ innings pitched, as manager John Schneider pulled him after 78 pitches and a giant lead as the Toronto bats were the exact opposite of New York’s — scorching hot.</p><p>The Blue Jays surprised Yankees ace Max Fried, as Ernie Clement got the scoring started with a two-run homer in the bottom of the second. Then the Blue Jays extended their lead with an Alejandro Kirk groundout, a Daulton Varsho double and a Clement single to make it 5-0.</p><p>The wheels fell off for New York when Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who homered in Game 1’s 10-1 victory, launched a grand slam off Will Warren, who came in for Fried after the lefty’s day ended after just three innings.</p><p>With a 9-0 lead, Varsho added the first of two homers in the game, a two-run shot that made it 11-0. George Springer added a homer off Warren in the bottom of the fifth, and Varsho’s second came in the bottom of the sixth.</p><p>The Yankees managed some runs to at least keep the game competitive, with Bellinger hitting a two-run homer followed by a five-run seventh inning.</p><p>But it was all for naught, as the Yankees head back to the Bronx in shambles after two dominant performances by the Blue Jays. New York faces elimination the rest of the way, while Toronto hopes to collect one more win to send it to the ALCS.</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Arizona Cardinals looked like they were cruising to their third win of the 2025 NFL season, but two head-scratching mistakes resulted in the Tennessee Titans’ first win of the year instead. </p><p>The Titans defeated the Cardinals, 22-21, on a walk-off field goal to snap a four-game losing streak to start the year, while Arizona was left flabbergasted after blowing a 21-6 lead they had at halftime. </p><p>Arizona’s first bizarre blunder came on what should’ve been the game-sealing score for the home team, as Emari Demercado broke free on what looked like a 72-yard touchdown run. </p><p>However, he committed the biggest do-not in the NFL as he was seen releasing the ball before he crossed the goal line. So, instead of a 28-6 lead for the Cardinals to start the fourth quarter, the Titans got the ball at the 20-yard line after a horrendous touchback. </p><p>Titans quarterback Cam Ward used that gift to go 80 yards for the team’s first touchdown of the game, as Tony Pollard busted into the end zone from one yard out to make it 21-12 (Joey Slye’s extra point was no good). </p><p>The second blunder for the Cardinals was even more crazy to wrap your head around. It appeared Arizona got the game-sealing interception when Dadrion Taylor-Demerson hauled in a tipped Ward pass while Tennessee was in the red zone. But Taylor-Demerson tumbled to the ground and lost the ball. </p><p>From there, it was pinball as multiple Cardinals players tried to recover the fumble, but the ball managed to ricochet its way into the end zone where Titans receiver Tyler Lockett secured it. It was ruled a touchdown because the ball remained live even with the boots from the Cardinals players. </p><p>The score was now 21-19 and the Cardinals had the opportunity to still salvage a victory despite the horrible mistakes. But after the Titans’ defense forced a punt, Ward had time to get downfield and perhaps allow Slye the chance for the win. </p><p>That’s exactly what he did when he found Calvin Ridley on a 38-yard strike to put the Titans at the Cardinals’ 15-yard line. An 11-yard run from Pollard secured a chip-shot field goal chance and Slye buried the 29-yarder at the buzzer for the impossible win. </p><p>Ward finished the game 21-of-39 for 265 yards with no touchdown passes and one interception, while Pollard had 67 yards rushing on 14 carries with his score. Ridley led the pass game with 131 yards on just five catches. </p><p>For the Cardinals, Murray went 23-of-31 for 220 yards, 98 of those going to Marvin Harrison Jr. on four catches. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Portland police chief touts 'crowd support' approach as ICE facility faces ongoing violence</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Portland Police Chief Bob Day defended his department’s reforms and "crowd support" policing even as federal agents faced violent anti-ICE protesters without help, after city leaders ordered police not to respond.</p><p>Last week, Cammila Wamsley, director of Portland’s ICE office, said the facility has endured more than 100 straight nights of violence, with Portland police largely absent under direction from the mayor and city council.</p><p>"It’s frustrating for us to watch people be attacked on the street and know that we don’t have the authority to be able to really step in unless there’s some nexus to federal law," Wamsley said.</p><p>She added that nightly protests have escalated beyond changes and signs, with bottle rockets striking the ICE building, rocks shattering windows, lasers targeting officers’ eyes and barricades blocking vehicles.</p><p>Despite these accounts, Day offered a very different picture in an opinion piece published by The Oregonian on Sunday, arguing that national media coverage of Portland and its police paint a misleading and outdated picture.</p><p>Day said he is "deeply proud" of how Portlanders show up for one another continuously, and equally proud of his police department.</p><p>"Unfortunately, national portrayals often distort reality. Portland is 145 square miles, yet one city block has drawn outsized attention in news cycles. Viral clips — sometimes months or years old — paint a picture that is not consistent with the Portland we see every day," Day wrote. "While this is frustrating, we are focused on what matters: keeping Portlanders safe."</p><p>Day said the department and its partners have reduced violent crime by 17% and successfully facilitated numerous peaceful protests as part of the city’s commitment to free speech.</p><p>Regarding protests at the federal building, Day said his officers are making arrests and pursuing prosecutions.</p><p>"It’s important to note that the Federal Protective Service secures the building itself, while Portland Police manages the surrounding neighborhoods," he said. "Recently, we have seen people with varying viewpoints come to the area with the intent to engage in violence and we are investigating several assaults; violence of any kind is unacceptable – we have and will continue to make arrests and pursue prosecutions. Free speech does not include freedom to commit crimes."</p><p>"There are also those who want to draw parallels about current events and 2020, when 100-plus nights of protests deeply impacted the city and Portland Police. But this isn’t 2020 for many reasons," Day continued. "Since I became chief two years ago, I have witnessed significant change. Reforms in use of force, crowd management and accountability have reshaped how we operate.</p><p>"As we have shown with the numerous massive protests that have occurred this year, large demonstrations can occur peacefully, and when disturbances arise, we take targeted action that can quickly restore order," he continued. "Five years ago, some city and state leadership left the police bureau isolated. Today, that has changed. The bureau is part of a united statewide effort, backed by strong leadership from the mayor, city council, city administrator, governor, our congressional delegation and fellow Portlanders."</p><p>Day also addressed the Trump administration’s plan to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland alongside other federal law enforcement agencies.</p><p>"One of the reasons given for this action has been that Portland Police are not responding to public disorder," Day wrote. "Just because officers are not seen wearing tactical gear lining up before crowds does not mean we are not responding. In fact, research shows that such tactics often escalate crowd behavior."</p><p>Instead, he explained, his department uses a layered approach to upholding public order, which begins with officers engaging with protest organizers before demonstrations begin.</p><p>Day said the outreach has resulted in meaningful conversations and stronger relationships in the community.</p><p>The next layer, he said, is the Rapid Response Team, trained to manage public order when criminal behavior occurs. Some of the responses may include making arrests.</p><p>"Our focus has shifted from ‘crowd control’ to ‘crowd support,’ with an emphasis on outreach, preparation and communication," Day said. "We now use evidence-based policing and crowd psychology in managing large public gatherings. These innovations have helped us connect with communities in new ways, already paying dividends in safer, more respectful demonstrations."</p><p>Day closed his essay on an optimistic note, urging Portlanders to focus on civic engagement and community service.</p><p>"Rather than focusing on what cannot be done, this is an opportunity to channel that energy into action — through volunteering, community service or civic engagement," he continued. "Turning dissonance into action is far more productive. Showcasing our city in social media and other forms of communication has been telling the real story.</p><p>"Much like any major city, our challenges are significant, and we are addressing them," Day added. "Yet I believe this is Portland’s opportunity — not to be defined by division, but to show resilience, unity and innovation."</p><p>Anti-ICE protests have continued across the country in recent weeks, including in Portland and near Chicago.</p><p>On Saturday, federal agents were rammed and boxed in by 10 cars near Chicago, where anti-ICE crowds have gathered for days and nearly a dozen people have been arrested.</p><p>Earlier this summer, President Donald Trump deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration enforcement protests.</p><p>On Saturday, a federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Portland as part of a lawsuit brought by the state and city.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>UFC CEO Dana White has built even more intrigue around a potential fight card at the White House next year.</p><p>White predicted he will have "the greatest fight card ever assembled" for the June 2026 event that could take place on the White House lawn.</p><p>"If you look at what we’re looking down the barrel of now, we’re about to go on a new network on Paramount. We need to deliver a massive, incredible card in January," White said after UFC 320 on Saturday night, per Yahoo Sports. "Then in February, we’ll start looking at building the White House card, which I will right now tell you will be the greatest fight card ever assembled in the history of, at least, definitely this company."</p><p>While White has addressed many questions about the first-of-its-kind destination, he said the idea is still in the preliminary stages.</p><p>"We’re still talking about the production and how everything’s gonna work at the White House," he said. "We have not started negotiating any fights for the White House yet."</p><p>UFC will move exclusively to Paramount in January after a $7.7 billion deal to leave ESPN, where it has aired for many years.</p><p>White added that superstar fighters have been lobbying to be part of the White House card, though no negotiations have begun.</p><p>Among them is Conor McGregor, but White tempered expectations for his long-awaited return to the octagon.</p><p>"I made it clear Conor wants to fight on that card, and you can clearly see Conor is very fired up to fight on that card," White said. "But nothing is done yet, and no fights are being negotiated with the White House."</p><p>The UFC event is expected to be part of the United States’ 250th birthday celebration. White previously said it was President Donald Trump’s idea to host the fight at his residence in Washington, D.C.</p><p>"I didn’t ask – he brought it up to me," White said on Logan Paul’s "Impaulsive" podcast last month.</p><p>"When you walk around the White House with him, he’s so proud of the White House, and he loves it so much and he loves America. He believes that the White House belongs to the people of America," White continued. "He wants to do more things like kids coming in doing Easter egg hunts, things around Christmas and special events. … That’s his thing. He wants to bring more Americans to the White House. His thing was, ‘This is your house.’ I was lucky he said, ‘We should do a fight here.’"</p><p>White also confirmed a rumor that fighters would walk out of the Oval Office before entering the octagon.</p><p>"This is a one-in-one, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that will never happen again," White added.</p><p>White and Trump have been friends for years, with Trump attending numerous UFC fights. White also spoke at the Republican National Convention when Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that weigh-ins will take place at the Lincoln Memorial.

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The White House dismissed NBC’s "Saturday Night Live" as a "waste of time" akin to watching paint dry when reached for comment about its recent season premiere.</p><p>The long-running sketch comedy series began its 51st season Saturday night and once again featured cast member James Austin Johnson portraying President Donald Trump interrupting the cold open, joking that he could have the show canceled if it became too critical.</p><p>"I'm just here keeping my eye on ‘SNL.’ Making sure they don't do anything too mean about me," Johnson said as Trump.</p><p>In another line, Johnson added, "But they better be on their best behavior, otherwise they're going to have to answer to my attack dog at the FCC, Brendan Carr."</p><p>He also closed out the sketch warning the show that "Daddy’s watching."</p><p>Despite the sketch mocking Trump, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson dismissed the attack and the show in a comment to Entertainment Weekly, saying she has "more entertaining" things to do with her time.</p><p>"Reacting to this would require me to waste my time watching it," White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said. "And like the millions of Americans who have tuned out from SNL, I have more entertaining things to do—like watch paint dry."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to NBC for comment.</p><p>The opening sketch likely referenced late-night host and frequent Trump critic Jimmy Kimmel being suspended by ABC after broadcasting shows preempted his show for his controversial comments related to Charlie Kirk’s assassin. </p><p>Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr also issued a veiled threat against the show before it was suspended.</p><p>ABC restored Kimmel’s show less than one week later.</p><p>"Saturday Night Live" has frequently mocked Trump in the show’s cold open since his 2024 election campaign. Though Trump has criticized the show in the past, his administration and 2024 campaign team have largely ignored "SNL" throughout his second term.</p><p>One exception came in September 2024, when the Trump campaign fired back at a sketch that mocked assassination attempts against him.</p></body></div></body></html>

Non-essential civilian War Department employees, including thousands who support base operations and logistics, have been furloughed. </p><p>Meanwhile, military support programs — including child care centers, on-base commissaries, and other family services — have been scaled back at several installations, forcing families to shoulder unexpected costs.</p><p>During a Sept. 30 speech at Quantico, before the nation's top generals, Trump said he was backing a 3.8% pay raise for every servicemember.

<div class="article-title">Your morning coffee could be sabotaging your prescription drugs without you knowing it</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>For many people, the day doesn’t start until coffee does. But if you take prescription drugs or supplements, that caffeine hit might do more than perk you up: it can alter how your body absorbs medication, amplify side effects or dull a drug’s impact.</p><p>Here’s how caffeine interacts with different types of medications, and how to time your coffee to stay in the clear.</p><p>Caffeine itself raises heart rate and blood pressure temporarily, so pairing it with drugs that influence the cardiovascular system can create unwanted overlap.</p><p>Caffeine can affect how blood clots in the same way blood thinners do. That means, when combined, it may heighten your risk of bruising or bleeding, according to medical experts.</p><p>Many "non-drowsy" over-the-counter cold and allergy medications already contain stimulants to fight fatigue. Add coffee, and the combo can cause sleeplessness, jitteriness or raised blood sugar. This is why experts generally recommend skipping caffeine while taking stimulant-based cold remedies.</p><p>By contrast, drowsy formulas containing diphenhydramine don’t interact with caffeine in this way.</p><p>On the flip side, melatonin promotes rest. Drinking coffee near bedtime, or alongside melatonin, undermines its effectiveness. Research also suggests frequent caffeine use may suppress your body’s natural melatonin production over time.</p><p>Caffeine’s own short-term spike in blood pressure can lead to an increased risk of heart-related complications such as stroke or heart attack.</p><p>According to academic medical center and community hospital network, University Hospitals, blood pressure drugs also rely on consistent absorption to keep levels stable — something caffeine can easily disrupt, as is the case with the medications below.</p><p>Some drugs only work properly when absorbed under specific conditions. According to experts, caffeine can disrupt that balance.</p><p>The American Thyroid Association warns that coffee taken within an hour of thyroid medication can sharply reduce absorption. They recommend waiting 30–60 minutes before reaching for your cup.</p><p>Certain osteoporosis medications must be taken on an empty stomach with plain water; pairing them with coffee can block absorption entirely. Research in Osteoporosis International also links high caffeine intake to a greater risk of bone loss over time.</p><p>Caffeine constricts blood vessels and tightens the blood-brain barrier, potentially limiting how much Alzheimer’s medication reaches the brain and reducing its therapeutic benefit.</p><p>Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant, which means it can either amplify or counteract drugs that affect brain chemistry.</p><p>Some asthma medications open airways by relaxing muscles, but their side effects include jitteriness and restlessness, which are similar to caffeine’s. Taken together, they can intensify these experiences, according to Harvard Health.</p><p>Caffeine and certain antidepressants are metabolized by the same liver enzymes. If you mix them too closely, the interference may reduce the antidepressant’s potency, or amplify the stimulant effects of caffeine, according to University Hospitals.</p><p>The same source notes that caffeine can interfere with antipsychotic drugs as well, reducing their intended impact.</p><p>None of this means you have to abandon your morning coffee, because in most cases, it’s not the caffeine itself; it’s when you drink it.</p><p>Giving your medication at least 30 to 60 minutes of breathing room (or longer, depending on your prescription) usually allows both to work as intended.</p><p>When in doubt, confirm with your doctor or pharmacist. A small change in timing can keep your treatment on track and your coffee habit intact.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called President Donald Trump's behavior "unhinged" and "unreasonable" on Sunday during NBC's "Meet the Press." </p><p>Jeffries was responding to the president's posts about the Democratic lawmaker last week as the government remains shut down. </p><p>"Let me ask you, because the administration has personally targeted you with memes throughout this negotiation. We’ll show a screenshot of one of the videos. This was put out by the president. The president also called the Democrats the party of, ‘hate, evil, and Satan.’ Is the president someone you still feel like you can negotiate with? Do you have that relationship with him?" NBC News host Kristen Welker asked.</p><p>Trump shared a meme video to Truth Social on Monday that showed Jeffries wearing a mustache and a sombrero while mariachi music played in the background. </p><p>"That behavior is outrageous, it’s unhinged, it’s unreasonable, and it speaks for itself. The American people deserve better than lies, than attacks, than deep fake videos and the president spending all of his time on the golf course. We need serious leadership," Jeffries said.</p><p>"And we will continue to make clear — Leader Schumer, myself — that we will sit down any time, any place, with anyone to address this issue with the seriousness that it deserves, to stand up for the American people," Jeffries said. </p><p>The lawmaker also accused Republicans of creating a "cost-of-living" crisis.  </p><p>Welker confronted Jeffries on his past stance regarding funding the government, showing the minority leader a clip of himself from 2023, during which he said, "A continuing resolution that is at the fiscal year 2023 levels is the only way forward."</p><p>"Why not fund the government and debate extending ObamaCare tax credits after the fact? They don’t expire until the end of the year," Welker asked.</p><p>"What we've called for is a bipartisan negotiation, where Democrats and Republicans can sit down in good faith, reopen the government, pass a spending bill that actually improves the quality of life for the American people, in an environment where the cost of living is already too high," he said. </p><p>He pointed to the tax credits again and argued America is too expensive, blaming the president. </p><p>"If these affordable tax care credits are allowed to expire, premium and healthcare costs are going to skyrocket. And America is already too expensive for the American people because of the Trump failed policies, the Trump tariffs, and this will make things worse. So we just want a bipartisan negotiation that addresses the healthcare crisis at the same period of time with the fierce urgency of now," he said. </p><p>The White House responded to Jeffries comments by saying the Democrats' position on giving health care to illegal aliens as "unhinged and unreasonable." </p><p>"Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrat Party shut down the government and are hurting the American people because they want to give free health care to illegal aliens – that’s what’s unhinged and unreasonable. The sombreros will continue until the Democrats reopen the government," White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital. </p><p><i>The article was updated to include a statement from the White House. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Amy Schumer is showing off her impressive weight-loss. </p><p>On Saturday, the 44-year-old comedian took to social media to share a photo of her dramatic transformation. Schumer, who was wearing a tiny black dress and heels, was accompanied by two friends as the threesome enjoyed the Paul McCartney concert in Las Vegas.</p><p>Friends and fans were quick to share their thoughts, praising the actress for her progress. </p><p>"Okay Amyyyyyy🔥" comedian Anjelah Johnson commented. </p><p>"Ok legs for days!!🔥🔥❤️" the "Real Housewives of New Jersey" star Margaret Josephs added. </p><p>"Those legs ❤️❤️❤️" Isla Fisher wrote. </p><p>During an appearance on "The Howard Stern Show" earlier this year, the comedian opened up about her scary experience trying medication for weight-loss purposes.</p><p>"I have this gene - GDF15 - which makes you extremely prone to nausea which is why I was so sick during my pregnancy. So, I tried Ozempic almost three years ago and I was like bedridden, I was vomiting and then you have no energy but other people take it and they're all good," she explained.</p><p>"I lost 30 pounds so quick," said Schumer, who is mom to 4-year-old son, Gene, whom she shares with husband, Chris Fischer. "I looked great and I couldn't lift my head off the pillow, so what's the point?"</p><p>Ozempic, which is a semaglutide injection, was originally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, but the medication has increasingly been prescribed off label for weight loss, along with several other similar medications. </p><p>The actress has been open about her Ozempic use before and once blasted celebrities for saying they lost weight by simply eating "smaller portions" and "lying" about using the injectable drug. </p><p>"Like, shut the f--- up!" she said during an appearance on "Watch What Happens Live!" in 2023. "You are on Ozempic or one of those things or you got work done. Just stop."</p><p>"Like, a year ago, I tried it," she said. "It's like, you know, you try it.  And I was one of those people that felt so sick and couldn’t play with my son. I was so skinny, and he’s throwing a ball at me and [I couldn’t]."</p><p>"And you're like, ‘OK, this isn’t livable for me,'" she added. </p><p>In March, Schumer praised the effects of Mounjaro (also known as tirzepatide) in a video clip shared on Instagram with her nearly 13 million followers.</p><p>"I wanted to share and keep it 100 with you, that years ago – and yes, this is completely unsafe to be driving and making a video – years ago, three years ago, I tried Wegovy and I was like puking," Schumer said in the clip captured while she was behind the wheel. </p><p>"I couldn't handle it. I don't know if they've changed the formula or whatever… but anyway, I went on this telehealth meeting with MidiHealth, and it was cheap. I wanted to try it myself, cause I wanted to recommend it to my friends who are like nurses and teachers."</p><p>In addition to the injectable medication, which is primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes, the "Trainwreck" star has a new routine which includes hormones.</p><p>"They put me on estrogen and progesterone because I realized I was in perimenopause and my symptoms of being in perimenopause have disappeared," Schumer said. </p><p>"My hair is fuller, my skin is better, I have more energy, I want to get down more if you know what I mean – I'm talking about sex."</p><p>She added, "So that's been great, Mounjaro’s been great… I'm having a really good experience with it and I wanted to keep it real with you about that."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Judge blocks Trump administration from sending National Guard troops to Oregon</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A federal judge late Sunday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon, after a legal whirlwind that began hours earlier when the president mobilized California troops for Portland after the same judge blocked him from using Oregon's National Guard the day before.</p><p>During a hastily called telephone hearing, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut granted a temporary restraining order sought by California and Oregon.  </p><p>A day earlier, the same judge <span class="link">temporarily blocked the administration from deploying Oregon National Guard troops to Portland</span>. But on Sunday, the president moved to send National Guard troops to the state from neighboring California and then from Texas. </p><p>Immergut, who was appointed by Mr. Trump during his first term, issued her second, more sweeping order late Sunday after she upbraided the federal government's attorney and questioned how the move to send the California and Texas troops to Oregon was not "in direct contravention of the order that was issued yesterday."  </p><p>The White House didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision. </p>
<p>Small protests have been going on nightly outside Portland's immigration processing facility since Mr. Trump's second term began in January. There have been occasional flare-ups, including in June, but for weeks the demonstrations attracted only a few dozen people - until the Trump administration <span class="link">mobilized the Oregon National Guard on Sept. 28 against Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek's wishes</span>.</p><p>A small number of demonstrators gathered Sunday evening cheered when they learned about the judge's order.</p><p>Immergut issued Saturday's order pending further arguments in a lawsuit brought by the state and city. She said the relatively small protests didn't justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.</p><p>Her Saturday ruling came after Mr. Trump called the city "war-ravaged." Oregon officials and Portland residents alike said that description was ludicrous.</p>
<p>A Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement that about 200 federalized members of the California National Guard who had been on duty around Los Angeles were being reassigned to Portland. Kotek said about 100 arrived Saturday and around 100 more were en route Sunday. </p><p>The two states originally requested a narrower order that would have blocked only California National Guard troops from being sent to Oregon, but asked for the order to apply to all National Guard troops after a memo written by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was submitted to the court that said up to 400 Texas National Guard personnel were being activated for deployment to Oregon, Illinois and possibly elsewhere. </p><p>Immergut grilled lawyers for the federal government, accusing them of seeking an end run around her Saturday order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Oregon. </p><p>"How could bringing in federalized National Guard from California not be in direct contravention of the TRO I issued yesterday?" she said Sunday.  </p><p>Immergut told one federal government attorney that he was "missing the point" because conditions on the ground in Oregon hadn't changed and she saw no legal basis and need for the military to assist local law enforcement. </p><p>Lawyers for the federal government tried to argue that Oregon and Portland didn't have standing and that California could show no harm by having some of its National Guard dispatched to another state.  </p><p>Scott Kennedy, the attorney representing Oregon, said he learned of the Texas National Guard mobilization just 24 minutes before the emergency hearing on Sunday night. "It feels a little bit like we're playing a game of rhetorical whack-a-mole here," he told Immergut. </p>
<p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a post on X Sunday night that he'd authorized the call-up of guard troops from his state. "You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it," he wrote. </p><p>The events in Oregon come a day after Illinois' governor made a similar announcement about troops in his state being activated.  </p><p>Kotek said the latest move by federal officials is an attempt to circumvent Saturday's court ruling that blocked deployment of Oregon's guard members.  </p><p>"The facts on the ground in Oregon haven't changed," Kotek said during a news conference Sunday. "There's no need for military intervention in Oregon. There's no insurrection in Portland, there's no threat to national security." </p><p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that personnel from his state were on their way Sunday and called the deployment "a breathtaking abuse of the law and power." He said these troops were "federalized" and put under the president's control months ago over his objections, in response to unrest in Los Angeles. </p><p>"The commander-in-chief is using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens," Newsom said. In a post on X, he said California would sue to try to stop the deployment.</p><p>After Immergut's late Sunday ruling, Newsom said on X that, "We just won in court — again. ... Trump's abuse of power won't stand."</p>
<p>In a related court filing, an attorney in the California Military Department said the U.S. Army Northern Command advised the department on Sunday that an order will be issued keeping the 300 guard personnel federalized through the end of January. </p><p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Trump's move to deploy the National Guard of one state to another "is well outside of the norms or practices" of any president.  </p><p>"But this President is determined to take as much power as the courts will give him. This fight isn't over, but today's rebuke of the president's illegal actions is a step in the right direction," Bonta said in a statement after Sunday night's ruling.  </p><p>Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said Sunday that he saw federal agents engaged in what he described as unjustified use of force and indiscriminately spraying pepper spray and impact munitions during a protest outside the ICE facility. </p><p>"This is an aggressive approach trying to inflame the situation that has otherwise been peaceful," Wilson said. </p><p>Portland has alerted the civil rights division of the Department of Justice to the agents' actions, Wilson said. </p><p>Mr. Trump has characterized both Portland and Chicago as cities rife with crime and unrest. Since the start of his second term, he has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities.</p>
<p>Last month, Mr. Trump <span class="link">signed a presidential memorandum</span> mobilizing federal law enforcement agents to Memphis, Tennessee, at the request of the Tennessee governor.  </p>
<h2>National Guard troops also deployed to Illinois</h2><p>The president has also ordered <span class="link">National Guard members from Texas to be deployed to Illinois</span>, Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday evening.</p><p>In a post on X, Pritzker said 400 members of the Texas National Guard will be deployed to Illinois, Oregon, and other locations within the U.S.</p><p>"No officials from the federal government called me directly to discuss or coordinate. We must now start calling this what it is: Trump's Invasion. It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state's military troops," Pritzker said, calling Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to immediately withdraw any support for and to refuse to coordinate.</p><p>In response, Abbott said he "fully authorized" the deployment of his state's troops "to ensure safety for federal officials."</p>

<p>Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said on Sunday evening that President Trump has ordered National Guard members from Texas to be deployed to Illinois.</p><p>In a post on X, Pritzker said 400 members of the Texas National Guard will be deployed to Illinois, Oregon, and other locations within the U.S.</p><p>"No officials from the federal government called me directly to discuss or coordinate.

The brave men and women who serve in our national guards must not be used as political props. This is a moment where every American must speak up and help stop this madness." Pritzker said.</p>
<p>In response, Abbott said he "fully authorized" the deployment of his state's troops "to ensure safety for federal officials."</p><p>"You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it," the Republican governor said on X.</p><p>This comes after a <span class="link">memo obtained by CBS News from the Pentagon</span> called for hundreds of National Guard troops to be sent to Illinois. Pritzker on Saturday said that the Trump administration intended to <span class="link">federalize 300 Illinois National Guard members</span> after he was offered an ultimatum on troop deployment. The ultimatum by the Trump administration, according to Pritzker, was "call up your troops, or we will."  </p><p>The possible arrival of National Guard members comes amid clashes between demonstrators and federal agents in Broadview, Illinois, where, within the past couple of weeks, over a dozen protesters were arrested.</p>
<p>Further protests against federal agents led to a woman being shot by an agent in Brighton Park on Saturday. She, along with another man, were charged with forcibly assaulting, impeding, and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer after the Department of Homeland Security said they rammed and boxed in the vehicle of federal agents. No agents were hurt in that incident, according to DHS.</p><p>It is unclear when or where specifically the National Guard will arrive in Illinois.  </p><p>At least <span class="link">200 federalized California National Guard members were deployed to Oregon</span> overnight into Sunday, according to officials, with more expected after a judge temporarily blocked the administration from deploying that Oregon's guard to Portland. The latest order for California's guard was also blocked Sunday by the same judge.</p><p>According to the Associated Press, President Trump is federalizing up to 400 from the Texas National Guard for Oregon, Illinois, and beyond, per Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's memo in a court filing. Less than an hour later, a federal judge temporarily blocked the administration from deploying any National Guard troops in Oregon, which also includes the California National Guard.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>From inoculations against polio and smallpox to protections from measles and tetanus, vaccines are critical health care tools that have saved more than 150 million lives in the past 50 years.</p><p>Rarely, they can also have side effects.</p><p>This week on 60 Minutes, correspondent Jon Wertheim reports on <span class="link">vaccine court</span>, a little-known legal forum that has, for almost four decades, been compensating Americans who say they were injured by vaccines. Whether a person developed chronic arthritis after receiving an MMR vaccine or a shoulder injury resulting from a misplaced tetanus shot, the vaccine court is intended to provide an efficient way to compensate claimants without overwhelming vaccine makers with legal fees.</p><p>But for the more than 14,000 people who say they were injured after receiving a COVID vaccine, finding compensation is currently a little more complicated.</p><h2>History of the VICP</h2><p>In the 1980s, there was a public health scare over the DTP vaccine, an older version of today's DTaP. At that time, families who said their children had been injured by the vaccine successfully sued the drug manufacturers in civil court. This caused all but one of those drug companies to stop production of the DTP vaccine.</p>
<p>Members of Congress and public health officials were concerned that if vaccine manufacturers weren't given some form of legal protection, they might stop other vaccine production, putting the public health at risk. In response, Congress passed a bipartisan bill establishing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP). The program acknowledged both that vaccines could cause injury while also partially shielding drug manufacturers from liability so they would continue to produce vaccines.</p><p>Vaccine court is part of that program. It allows people who claim vaccine-related injuries to seek compensation through a simplified legal process. There's no jury in vaccine court. Instead, cases are decided by one of eight judges called special masters. The court is no-fault, which means that petitioners who bring claims don't have to prove negligence. They just prove that more likely than not, their injury was caused by the vaccine.</p><p>The money for this program comes from a 75-cent tax added to every dose of recommended childhood vaccinations. Since the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program began, some 12,000 Americans have received almost $5 billion in payouts. </p><p>This program is structured around the Vaccine Injury Table, listing vaccines and eligible injuries. When the VICP began, it included six vaccinations. Today, that table has expanded to 16 immunizations, including the seasonal flu vaccine and those that inoculate against HPV.</p>
<p>Vaccine injuries remain very rare, but when they do occur, they can range from a physical injury in the shoulder because the needle is misplaced, to rare, severe cases in which a vaccine triggers a neurological condition.</p><h2>Where COVID sits today</h2><p>The vaccines that protect against COVID-19 are not among those included on the Vaccine Injury Table. That is because, to date, they are still included in a separate program for emergency measures.</p><p>In 2005, Congress established the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) to ensure public health during emergencies. The legislation partially shields manufacturers and health care workers from most lawsuits related to the use of certain medical treatments during public health emergencies, including vaccines. </p><p>People who do experience serious harm or death due to these medical measures may be eligible for compensation through the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP). This program only covers severe injuries or fatalities caused by approved emergency treatments. </p><p>Unlike VICP, the CICP is an administrative program. It has a one-year statute of limitations and is more restrictive than the vaccine court program, which is a judicial program with a three-year statute of limitations for vaccine injuries. In vaccine court, claimants can also be compensated for pain and suffering. </p><p>Around 14,000 claims have been brought to the countermeasures program regarding the COVID vaccinations. About 5,000 of those claims have been denied, and fewer than 100 have been compensated. The most common injuries compensated have been cases of myocarditis.</p><p>The COVID vaccines are considered safe and effective by public health organizations, including the CDC, which notes the rigorous clinical trials they underwent. As of May, more than 676 million doses of the COVID vaccines had been administered in the U.S.</p>
<h2>Adding COVID vaccines to the VICP</h2><p>Today, many legal experts say the COVID vaccines should be added to the VICP.</p><p>"Those people went out and did exactly what was asked of them to protect themselves, their communities, and their families. And they're basically being hung out to dry in the countermeasures program without any real compensation," said Renée Gentry, a top vaccine injury litigator and head of the Vaccine Injury Litigation Clinic at the George Washington University Law School. </p><p>For the COVID vaccines to be rolled into the VICP, three things would need to happen. First, the vaccine would again need to become a recommended childhood vaccine. Earlier this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory committee voted to change recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccine. The CDC now says parents of children over 6 months should speak with a health care provider about the COVID vaccination.</p><p>Next, Congress would need to pass an excise tax on the COVID vaccination so that the vaccine court would have the money to cover claims. </p><p>Finally, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. would have to put the COVID vaccine on the Vaccine Injury Table.</p><p>In an email to 60 Minutes, Kennedy said the CDC makes the underlying decision, and he "will accept their recommendations, including as to COVID vaccines."</p><p>If the PREP Act Declaration for COVID is terminated before the vaccines protecting against it are added to the vaccine court, COVID vaccine manufacturers would lose their shield from legal liability. The Department of Health and Human Services late last year extended certain elements of the PREP Act for COVID, keeping liability protections for certain countermeasures — including vaccine manufacturers and distributors — through 2029.  </p>
<h2>"Crushing" to add the COVID vaccine</h2><p>The concern with adding COVID to the vaccine court is a matter of backlog, given the thousands of Americans who believe that they were injured by the COVID vaccine who have already brought claims to the countermeasures program. The number of special masters who adjudicate such claims has stayed at eight since the late 1980s, even though the number of cases in the court has multiplied.</p><p>"Without any improved infrastructure, without any additional special masters, it's going to be crushing," Gentry told 60 Minutes. "Because we know there are 10,000 unresolved cases in COVID in the countermeasures program still that haven't been addressed. If just those cases came over, it would be a massive impact on the court. But we know that there are tens of thousands of other potential cases that are out there."</p><p>The vaccine court's chief special master agrees. He addressed the possibility of adding COVID vaccines to the court in a letter to Congress last year, writing, "The court's ability to resolve vaccine injury claims efficiently will be crippled in the event we are not permitted to add more judicial officers..."</p><p>Still, those with knowledge about the subject say the COVID vaccine should be added.</p><p>"It is a medical intervention that we administered to otherwise healthy people that can cause side effects, and the fact that by having them vaccinated means that people who can't be vaccinated are protected. That herd immunity, if you will," said retired special master Denise Vowell.</p><p>Vowell and another former special master, George Hastings, addressed the possibility that, were the COVID vaccines added to the vaccine court, it might dissuade people from receiving the vaccine, an outcome that would be at odds with the court's founding purpose.</p><p>"That's always been a concern going back for the whole life of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, that the fact that you even had this system might worry people that vaccines can cause injuries," Hastings said. "But the overall benefit is to have a program that, if there are rare instances where there are some adverse reactions, you compensate them without forcing people into a litigation system that would take forever. And then you'll keep the vaccines flowing into people's arms."</p>
<p>Vowell was more pointed, noting that, while many public health interventions have side effects, the benefits outweigh them — especially when it comes to children's health.</p><p>"Overall, the vaccine process has saved lives," Vowell said. "If you go to an old cemetery and you look at headstones and you see the number of children who died at six months or three years of age, and then you go to a more modern cemetery today, you don't see that number of children. Why? Because vaccine preventable illnesses have not been conquered, but they have been put in check."</p><p><em>The video above was produced by Denise Schrier Cetta, Brit McCandless Farmer, Elizabeth Germino, and Jane Greeley.

<div class="article-title">CBS News poll finds few feel shutdown is worth it</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>For many Americans, across party lines, concern over the <span class="link">government shutdown</span> means concern about its potential impact on the economy, among other things.  </p><p>Therefore, many don't think either party's position is worth having a shutdown over. </p><p>Given that, no one is looking especially good politically at the moment. President Trump, congressional Democrats, and Republicans are all net negative on their handling of the <span class="link">shutdown</span> thus far.  </p><p>Neither party is on very solid footing. The top descriptor Americans pick for the Democratic Party overall is "weak;" the party trails the GOP on being described as "effective" and "strong," and their favorables trail the GOP's. The top descriptor for Republicans, though, is "extreme."  </p><p>All of it looks to the public like another distraction from larger matters of concern. A sizable majority of the country says the Trump administration isn't focused enough on <span class="link">lowering prices</span>, and is focused too much on <span class="link">tariffs</span>, as they have been for months. Reflecting some of that, many still describe the president himself as "energetic," but fewer describe him now as "focused" than did at the start of his term. </p>
<p>Relatively few Americans say the Democrats' or Republicans' positions are worth a shutdown. As it is still fairly recent, many aren't sure yet. </p>
<p>For the Democrats, only half their rank and file think their party's positions are worth a shutdown, and even fewer Republicans say that of the GOP's positions. That said, they don't blame their respective parties for the situation, either. </p>
<p>There's plenty of that blame to go around. Republicans and the president get relatively more than congressional Democrats, but taken together with Americans who blame both equally, a majority of the country holds all of them responsible.  </p>
<p>When asked what the shutdown debate is mainly about, <span class="link">health care</span> is the top response from a list of issues, and those following the matter more closely pick that more often. That may speak to the parties' respective arguments getting at least to their bases. </p><p>The percentage very concerned about the impact on the <span class="link">economy</span> is higher than for other items. </p><p>People also express concern, to a lesser degree, about the effects of the shutdown on federal employees. Also, the military, transportation and air travel, and Social Security and Medicare, which, even if they are not directly part of the negotiations, likely show that people tend to associate these programs with the government, generally. </p>
<p>Still, overall views and descriptors of the parties aren't positive ones. Each has underwater favorability ratings overall, with the Republicans getting slightly better ratings than the Democrats. </p>
<p>From a list of descriptors of the parties, it's a case of weak (the way most of the nation describes the Democratic Party) versus extreme (the most often-picked label for the GOP).  </p><p>The Republican Party greatly outpaces the Democrats on being called "effective" and "strong." </p><p>Over four in 10 rank-and-file Democrats describe their own party as weak. </p>
<h2> The economy and the president </h2><p>Against the backdrop of the shutdown, and helping explain why so many are concerned about its economic impact, inflation and the economy continue to be seen as the nation's top issues. And as has been the case for a while, a large majority says the Trump administration isn't focused enough on lowering prices. And most continue to say it is focused too much on tariffs. </p>
<p>And most say Trump's policies are costing jobs in the U.S., rather than creating jobs. </p><p>That's combined with Americans' view that Trump's policies aren't making them better off and are still making prices go up. On balance, the president's handling of inflation, specifically, has ticked down again. </p>
<p>Fewer Americans now describe the president as "focused" than did at the start of his second term. His top descriptors remain "tough" and "energetic," but the percentage who call him "effective" is also down compared to February. </p>
<p>More broadly — and not specifically related to the shutdown, but perhaps pertinent given that situation — Americans still say it's Congress, not the president, who should have the most authority over federal spending. That's a view held by majorities of Democrats, independents, and Republicans.  </p>
<p>Donald Trump's overall approval rating, at 42%, is now back down to what it was in <span class="link">July</span>, after hitting 44% <span class="link">last month</span>. He remains bolstered by support from his Republican base, and still gets better marks on his deportation program and immigration than on inflation and the economy overall. </p>
<p>At 43%, the president's approval rating on handling the conflict between Israel and Hamas is similar to what it was this summer, and higher than his approval ratings on economic issues. (This polling was conducted before <span class="link">reports of a possible ceasefire deal</span>.) </p><h2> <strong>Troops and U.S. cities</strong> </h2><p>The idea of troops going to U.S. cities remains divisive. It's backed staunchly by the president's Republican base, especially those who identify as MAGA, but finds far less backing beyond it. </p><p>Whether it's the National Guard specifically or active-duty military troops going to cities, views are similar. Much of it, beyond the partisan breaks, is tied to where one sees threats to the U.S. originating. </p><p>Those who support troops in cities tend to see threats from inside the country, subscribing to some of the arguments made by the administration, that threats are coming from domestic enemies. </p><p>But for the majority of Americans who see dangers more from economic forces, or who feel the U.S. military's overall focus ought to be outside the U.S., it is much less so. </p>
<p>For decades now, a majority of Americans have backed having women who serve in the military participating in combat roles, and that continues to be the case today, at three-quarters, a view shared equally by men and women. The quarter of Americans who do not think women in the military should participate in combat roles tend to be more conservative. </p>
<p><em>This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,441 U.S. adults interviewed between October 1-3, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

<div class="article-title">Trump urges Gaza peace deal negotiators to "move fast" ahead of Cairo talks</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump urged negotiators set to meet Monday for crucial talks aimed at ending the war in Gaza to "move fast" as hopes for a peace deal grew after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said <span class="link">a hostage release could be announced this week.</span></p><p>Tuesday marks two years since the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that <span class="link">sparked the war.</span></p><p>"There have been very positive discussions with Hamas, and Countries from all over the World (Arab, Muslim, and everyone else) this weekend, to release the Hostages, end the War in Gaza but, more importantly, finally have long sought PEACE in the Middle East," Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday. "These talks have been very successful, and proceeding rapidly."</p><p>He added: "The technical teams will again meet Monday, in Egypt, to work through and clarify the final details. I am told that the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to MOVE FAST. I will continue to monitor this Centuries old 'conflict.' TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE OR, MASSIVE BLOODSHED WILL FOLLOW – SOMETHING THAT NOBODY WANTS TO SEE!"</p>
<p>On Friday, Hamas said it had accepted some elements from the U.S.-led peace plan that Mr. Trump outlined last month. Under the plan, Hamas would release the remaining 48 hostages — about 20 believed to be alive — within 72 hours. It would also give up power and disarm, which Hamas has not agreed to do.</p>
<p>The delegation led by top Israeli negotiator Ron Dermer will leave Monday for the talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Netanyahu's office said. An Egyptian official said the Hamas delegation had arrived. U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and <span class="link">Jared Kushner</span>, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, are joining the talks, a senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News.</p><p>Discussions will focus on the proposed exchange of hostages for <span class="link">Palestinian prisoners</span> held by Israel, Egypt's foreign ministry said.</p><p>In a brief statement on Saturday, Netanyahu said he hopes to announce the release of all hostages "in the coming days" and that "our goal is to contain these negotiations to a time frame of a few days."</p><p>But he signaled there would not be a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, something Hamas has long demanded.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio told <span class="link">CBS News' "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"</span> on Sunday that the release of hostages from Gaza is the "most emergent and immediate phase" of the <span class="link">peace plan</span>.</p>
<p>"Beyond that is what happens after that, and that is, how do we ensure that we can create and help build a Gaza free of terrorism, free of Hamas, free of anything like Hamas," Rubio said. "And that's going to take work and some time not just to agree on, but to implement."</p><p>On the hostages, Rubio said the "expectation is that this happens quickly," though he wasn't clear on a specific deadline. He acknowledged that there are some logistical hurdles, including Israeli bombardment.</p><p>"Reality is, this is a war zone. I mean, this is a place that's suffered a tremendous amount of destruction. That fighting needs to stop," Rubio said. "You can't release hostages while there's still bombardments going on."</p><p>CBS News team members in East Jerusalem reported that there were Israeli bombardments underway, including strikes on Saturday. </p><p>As hundreds of thousands of people marched across Israel, several European cities and elsewhere in support of ending the war, the foreign ministers of eight Muslim-majority countries issued a joint statement welcoming steps toward a possible ceasefire.</p><p>They also underlined their commitment to the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, unifying Gaza and the West Bank and reaching an agreement leading to a "full Israeli withdrawal" from Gaza.</p><p>Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Priscilla turned into a hurricane on Sunday in the Pacific Ocean, and it is expected to continue strengthening into next week.</p><p>The storm system formed Saturday off the west coast of Mexico, where it was forecast to bring dangerous surf and possible flooding, the National Hurricane Center said. Priscilla moved over Pacific waters on a path expected to run parallel to the land.</p><p>Tropical storm watches are in effect for a vast stretch of the Mexican coastline from the southwestern state of Jalisco up to the Baja California peninsula. </p><h2>Hurricane Priscilla's track and forecast</h2><p>On its forecast track, Priscilla's center was expected to remain offshore of the southwestern Mexican coast and travel parallel to the land through the early part of the week, the hurricane center said.</p>
<p>As of the NHC's 8 p.m. ET update on Sunday, the storm was located about 285 miles south-southwest of Cabo Corrientes, near the resort town Puerto Vallarta, and about 480 miles south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. </p>
<p>It was traveling north-northwestward at 3 mph with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph.</p><p>Although Priscilla was not forecast to directly touch land, the hurricane center said tropical storm conditions, including powerful winds, were possible in areas under a tropical storm watch on Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p>Heavy rain and, possibly, flash flooding, were also expected across parts of southwestern Mexico through Monday.</p><p>"Across coastal portions of Michoacán and far western Guerrero, rainfall amounts of 4 to 6 inches are expected, with local amounts of up to 8 inches," the hurricane center said. "Across Colima, western Jalisco, and the rest of Guerrero along the coast, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected. This rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain."</p>
<p>Priscilla could also generate potentially life-threatening surf conditions and rip currents in coastal areas of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula, the hurricane center said. Some areas were already beginning to feel those effects Sunday, but forecasters warned that they may become more widespread by Monday.</p>

<div class="article-title">Families grappling with rare vaccine injuries fight for compensation</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>At his six-month check up, Jacob Thompson received a combination shot that included the recommended childhood vaccinations against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, or DTaP, all deemed safe and effective in clinical trials. Later that day, Jacob began to seize. </p><p>Doctors hoped the seizure was a one-time reaction. It wasn't. In the following months as the seizures continued, doctors diagnosed Jacob with a rare and severe form of epilepsy. His parents, John and Huali, became increasingly convinced that their son's condition could be traced back to his six-month shot. </p><p>"Vaccines are great. They've done a lot to help people. I think that parents need to know what can happen," John Thompson said. </p><p>Serious vaccine injuries are so rare that, while hard to quantify precisely, their have been likened to lottery odds and lightning strikes. When an injury happens, families like the Thompsons can go to vaccine court, part of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The court is not a place to prove or disprove the safety of vaccines, but rather to compensate the injured. </p><h2>The Thompsons' experience with vaccine court </h2><p>Jacob's life now is drastically different than it was before his first seizure. He was born in St. Louis on New Year's Eve 2011, rounding out a family of four, with sister Meili and parents John and Huali.</p>
<p>"He would be able to jump up and down on my wife's lap, and very alert, recognized who mom and dad was," Jacob's father said. </p><p>That all changed after he got his six-month vaccinations, Jacob's parents said. By age two, Jacob could suffer up to 700 seizures in one day. </p>
<p>The Thompsons, seeking accountability, took their case to Renée Gentry, who is a leading vaccine injury litigator and director of the Vaccine Injury Litigation Clinic at George Washington University Law School.</p><p>"All of my clients are vaccinated. Most of them will start the conversation by saying, 'I'm not anti-vax,'" Gentry said. </p>
<p>The Thompsons are not anti-vaxxers and are not invested in the heavily charged vaccine debate. They're invested in their son, Jacob — an anguishing exception, harmed by what they say is otherwise a public health force of good.</p><p>In July, the Thompsons received a judgment of $2.1 million in vaccine court based on the special master's ruling that it was more likely than not that Jacob's six-month vaccinations aggravated an underlying genetic mutation. Jacob, now 13, also received a lifetime annuity to cover his future care.</p><h2>The development of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</h2><p>Jacob is one of around 12,000 Americans who've received payments through vaccine court since it was started in the late 1980s. Almost $5 billion has been made in payouts since the program began. </p><p>The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was established in response to a public health scare in the 1980s. When families of injured children went to civil court and successfully sued the manufacturers of the DTP vaccine — an older version of the DTaP vaccine — it caused all but one of those drug companies to pull out of the market, resulting in vaccine shortages. </p><p>Congress crafted a bill that partially shielded drug manufacturers from liability so they would continue to develop life-saving vaccines.</p><p>"It's bipartisan. It takes everyone's views into account. And everybody compromises, which is a dirty word now. But that's the goal of it," Gentry said. "And it's helped these people. Jacob will be taken care of for the rest of his life because of this program."</p>
<p>While global immunizations have saved an estimated 154 million lives worldwide, Congress acknowledged that vaccines can cause injury. As bill sponsor Sen. Ted Kennedy described, when "children are the victims of an appropriate and rational national policy, a compassionate Government will assist them in their hour of need."</p>
<p>There's no jury in vaccine court. Cases are decided by one of eight judges called special masters. The court pays lawyers by the hour. Where does money come from? There is a 75-cent tax imposed on recommended childhood vaccines which goes into a trust fund earmarked for vaccine injury compensation. </p><p>People who believe they've been injured by a vaccine can still sue a manufacturer, but they have to file in vaccine court first. And the burden of proof for claimants is lower in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, so it's easier for people to get compensation, Gentry said.</p><p>Drug companies are left out of the proceedings in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. It's a "no fault" court, meaning negligence does not need to be proven, just that the vaccine more likely than not caused the injury. </p><p>"There's very clear indication that said it would be better to compensate somebody that wasn't injured than to miss somebody who was," Gentry said.</p><p>The program is structured around a Vaccine Injury Table listing eligible vaccines and injuries. If your child, for instance, got a rubella vaccine and developed chronic arthritis within seven to 42 days, you may be eligible for damages.</p><p>The most common compensation is for shoulder injuries suffered from a misplaced injection. You can file for an injury not on the table. Overall, about half of all claims are dismissed. </p><p>The table now has 16 vaccines listed, up from six when it was created. It includes the annual flu shot, though not the <span class="link">COVID vaccine</span>. Autism is not listed among the eligible injuries. </p>
<h2>Vaccine court and autism </h2><p>The decision to leave autism off the injuries list did not come easily, retired Special Masters Denise Vowell and George Hastings said. The issue was litigated and decided in their court 15 years ago.</p><p>In the early 2000s, cases alleging vaccinations caused autism flooded the court, more than 5,000 in all. Vowell, Hastings and a third special master oversaw what was a class action of sorts that spanned almost a decade.</p>
<p>Vowell said the special masters ultimately concluded the evidence wasn't there. Vowell had hoped it would be. "Because the parents of children with autism go through so much," she said. </p><p>But, she told 60 Minutes, she could not base her decision on sentiment. </p><p>"I had to apply the law. And the law was that if there is a preponderance of evidence of vaccine causation, I rule for them. If there isn't, I rule against them," Vowell said.</p><p>All three special masters concluded there was no link between vaccines and autism. On appeal, eight additional federal judges unanimously upheld the vaccine court decisions. </p><p>This has not been persuasive to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>
<p>Secretary of Health and Human Services Kennedy, whose uncle was a champion of the court, is imbued with the authority to add or redefine injuries on the vaccine table. </p><p>He declined a 60 Minutes request for an on-camera interview but said via email that he would like to "expand the table," which he hopes will create an easier path to compensation. In particular, he wants to broaden definitions for "seizures and encephalopathy," two neurological conditions that can be associated with autism. </p><h2>Criticism of vaccine court</h2><p>Kennedy told 60 Minutes that though the court's original intent was "idealistic, compassionate, and sensible,it has become "a disaster for the families of injured children. Its effective function is delay, denial, and systematic cruelty."</p><p>Ryan Farrell, who received a tetanus shot in 2017 after cutting his hand on some rusty metal, is very familiar with the delays in vaccine court. </p><p>He started suffering pain a few days after getting the tetanus shot. </p><p>"I felt like my back was just, like, being stabbed, like I was being like crushed," Farrell said.</p>
<p>At one point, he could see out of only one eye. His bladder shut down. He was hospitalized multiple times over the next few years. Doctors diagnosed him with a rare autoimmune disease. </p>
<p>"I didn't wanna live for a long time," Farrell said. "That's how I felt." </p><p>His wife, Angela, made the link between Farrell's condition and his tetanus shot. She hadn't heard of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program at the time, but stumbled upon it online and found a lawyer. </p><p>They filed a case in 2019, and only in July of this year did the special master rule that the tetanus shot more likely than not, likely led to Farrell's illness. </p><p>Vaccine court was intended to compensate people for vaccine injuries "quickly, easily, and with certainty and generosity," according to Congress.</p><p>"That couldn't be further from the truth," Farrell said. </p><p>He remains unable to work. And six years in, the court has yet to determine his damages. </p><p>The court acknowledges the delays. Citing a backlog of more than 3,000 cases, its chief special master has — in documents obtained by 60 Minutes — asked Congress for help four years running, saying, "it becomes more difficult each year to resolve the huge number of case filings in the expedient fashion they deserve."</p>
<p>Yet, Congress has not acted.</p><p>Vaccination has become such a loaded, heavily politicized issue that some legislators appear to be reluctant to wade in.</p><p>"If what you care about are vaccine-injured people, and them being compensated, then you want this court to work. And you want this court to be here," Gentry said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Vaccine court: Where claims about rare injury after vaccination are heard</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>If you've never before heard of the national vaccine court, you're hardly alone. It sits inconspicuously, a few hundred yards from the White House; and stands as a model of effective public policy, balancing the societal good of widespread vaccination with rare individual harm. Founded in the 1980s, the court has, with little fanfare, paid out billions of dollars to Americans who have claimed injury after getting a vaccine. Today, with vaccine skepticism rising and given voice in the highest ranks of government, we wondered: can this singular court block out the noise, withstand the political winds, and stay true to its mission? </p><p>Jacob Thompson is 13 years old. He loves airplanes, swimming and Chick-fil-A. But Jacob can speak only a handful of words and needs help walking more than a few yards.</p><p>Jacob was born in St. Louis on New Year's Eve, 2011, rounding out a family of four, with sister Meili and parents John and Huali — he, a pilot for FedEx; she, a recent immigrant from China. </p><p>John Thompson: We had this perfectly normal, happy little baby. He would be able to jump up and down on my wife's lap, and very alert, recognized who mom and dad was. </p><p>At his six-month checkup, Jacob received a combination shot that included the recommended childhood vaccinations against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, or DTaP, all deemed safe and effective in clinical trials. </p>
<p>Hours later, Jacob began to seize. Doctors hoped it was a one-time reaction. It wasn't.</p>
<p>John Thompson: Within I'd say six months or less, he didn't know that we were mom and dad anymore, and he was slithering on the floor like a snake.</p><p>Jon Wertheim: Unrecognizable--</p><p>John Thompson: Un-- yeah.</p><p>Jon Wertheim: --from the child you knew?</p>
<p>John Thompson: Yeah.</p><p>By age two, Jacob could suffer up to 700 seizures in one day. He was diagnosed with a rare and severe form of epilepsy.</p><p>The Thompsons became increasingly convinced that his condition could be traced back to his six-month vaccinations. And, they began to seek accountability. They took their case to attorney Renée Gentry. </p><p>She's a leading vaccine injury litigator and director of the Vaccine Injury Litigation Clinic at George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Renée Gentry: I represent both vaccine-injured children and adults. All of my clients are vaccinated. Most of them will start the conversation by saying, "I'm not anti-vax." </p><p>Jon Wertheim: Why do you think they need to tell you right off the bat they're not anti-vax, but?</p><p>Renée Gentry: There's a lot of public pressure when you say that you have a vaccine injury, that people think you're some kind of a crazy person or you're out there. And also, because most people have never heard of a vaccine injury. They're rare. </p>
<p>So rare that, while hard to quantify precisely, the chances of serious vaccine injury have been likened to lottery odds, lightning strikes. Bear in mind, in total, global immunization has saved an estimated 154 million lives, six lives each minute.</p><p>But when an injury does occur, families can come to vaccine court, seen in this informational video. </p><p>Part of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, the court was established in response to a public health scare in the 1980s.</p><p>When families of injured children went to civil court and successfully sued the manufacturers of the DTP vaccine, an older version of DTaP, it caused all but one of those drug companies to pull out of the market, resulting in vaccine shortages. </p><p>Congress acted, crafting a bipartisan bill that partially shielded drug manufacturers from liability so they would continue to develop life-saving vaccines.</p><p>And, at the same time, Congress acknowledged that vaccines can cause injury. As bill sponsor Sen. Ted Kennedy described, when children are<em>,</em> "...the victims of an appropriate and rational national policy, a compassionate Government will assist them in their hour of need."</p>
<p>Renée Gentry: It was hailed as such a unique accomplishment back in the day because you had these disparate groups, you had the parents of vaccine-injured children together in the room with, with the manufacturers and everybody agreed that this was the best-case scenario. </p>
<p>Jon Wertheim: Is that fair to the public? They think they have an injury caused by a vaccine, but they can't sue the vaccine manufacturer directly?</p><p>Renée Gentry: You can still opt out of this program and sue a manufacturer. You have to just start in this program. But it's a lower burden of proof in our program. So it's an easier thing for vaccine-injured people to get compensation.</p><p>Drug companies are not only not being sued; they're not part of the proceedings. Vaccine court is a "no fault" court, meaning in cases like Jacob Thompson's, negligence does not need to be proven, just that the vaccine, more likely than not, caused the injury. </p><p>Vaccine court is not your typical court. There's no jury. Cases are decided in front of one of eight judges called special masters. Since the program began in the late '80s, 12,000 Americans have received almost $5 billion in payouts. There are no financial windfalls for lawyers — the court pays them by the hour. Where does all this money come from? A 75-cent tax, imposed on recommended childhood vaccines, goes into a trust fund earmarked for vaccine injury compensation. </p><p>In July the Thompsons received a judgment of $2.1 million based on the special master's ruling that it was more probable than not that Jacob's six-month vaccinations aggravated an underlying genetic mutation. Jacob also received a lifetime annuity to cover his future care. </p><p>Jon Wertheim: Is there any doubt that the vaccine caused Jacob's injury?</p><p>Renée Gentry: We can't ever prove scientific certainty on it.</p>
<p>Jon Wertheim: Does that not mean though that some cases are being compensated when in fact the science might not support it?</p><p>Renée Gentry: Sure. Sure. And that's what Congress intended. There's very clear indication that said it would be better to compensate somebody that wasn't injured than to miss somebody who was.</p><p>Jon Wertheim: How do you feel about that? </p><p>Renée Gentry: I think that's fine. While vaccines are critically important public health tools, they're not magic. You know, you can have an allergic reaction to aspirin. So it's a lot of different factors come into play to have a person be injured by a vaccine. Their genetics, their immune system. That's why the no-fault part is critical. The vaccine caused it. But there's no bad actor in this case.</p><p>The program is structured around a Vaccine Injury Table, basically, a conversion chart of vaccines and eligible injuries — if your child, for instance, got a rubella vaccine and developed chronic arthritis within seven and 42 days, you may be eligible for damages.</p><p>The most common compensation is for shoulder injuries suffered from a misplaced injection. You can file for an injury not on the table. Overall, half of all claims have been dismissed. </p><p>Today, vaccines on the table have jumped from the original six to 16, including the annual flu shot, though, notably not<span class="link">COVID</span>. As for the eligible injuries, autismis not one of them. </p>
<p>That decision did not come easily, as retired special masters Denise Vowell and George Hastings explained.</p>
<p>Jon Wertheim: There's been a lot of talk lately about a possible link between vaccines and autism. This has been litigated and decided in your court 15 years ago. </p><p>George Hastings: You know, I spent many, many years of my life, almost full-time looking at that issue. </p><p>In the early 2000s, cases alleging vaccinations caused autism flooded the court. Vowell, Hastings and a third special master oversaw what was a class action of sorts, a vaccine court proceeding that spanned almost a decade, incorporating testimony from dozens of medical experts and hundreds of scientific articles.</p><p>Jon Wertheim: What did you ultimately conclude?</p><p>Denise Vowell: Ultimately concluded there simply was not the evidence. I hoped there would be. </p><p>Jon Wertheim: Why?</p>
<p>Denise Vowell: Because the parents of children with autism go through so much.</p><p>But Vowell said she could not decide cases based on sentiment. </p><p>Denise Vowell: I had to apply the law. And the law was that if there is a preponderance of evidence of vaccine causation, I rule for them. If there isn't, I rule against them.</p><p>All three special masters concluded there was no link between vaccines and autism. On appeal, eight additional federal judges unanimously upheld the vaccine court decisions. </p><p>This has not been persuasive to Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.</p><p>We wanted to know RFK, Jr.'s views about vaccine court, a court his uncle championed, because today, as secretary of Health and Human Services,, he is imbued with the authority to add or redefine injuries on the vaccine table.</p><p>He declined our request for an on-camera interview but said via email that, yes, he wouldlike to "expand the table," which he hopes will create an easier path to compensation. In particular, he wants to broaden definitions for "seizures and encephalopathy," two neurological conditions that can be associated with autism. </p>
<p>Although the original intent was "idealistic, compassionate, and sensible," the court, RFK, Jr. told us, has become "a disaster for the families of injured children. Its effective function is delay, denial, and systematic cruelty."</p><p>Vaccine court delays are something Ryan Farrell knows only too well. </p>
<p>Husband to Angela and father of three, Ryan worked as a lineman for a Boston-area power company, hanging electrical wires 100 feet high. </p><p>On the job in 2017, Ryan cut his hand on rusty metal and got a tetanus shot. A few days later, the pain started.</p><p>Ryan Farrell: I felt like my-- my back was just, like, being stabbed. </p><p>Angela Farrell: He would take a shower, he was like, "I feel like there's razor blades hitting my skin."</p><p>Over the next few years, Ryan was hospitalized multiple times. Doctors diagnosed him with a rare autoimmune disease. </p>
<p>Ryan Farrell: I didn't wanna live for a long time, you know. That's how I felt. </p><p>Jon Wertheim: When did you make the link that "I had this vaccine. Maybe there's some correlation here?" </p><p>Angela Farrell: I made the correlation. </p><p>Like most Americans, Angela Farrell had never heard of vaccine court, but she stumbled upon it online and found a lawyer. They filed a case in 2019. And only in July, did the special master rule: the tetanus shot more likely than not led to Ryan's illness.</p><p>Jon Wertheim: Do you feel like you were treated with compassion?</p><p>Ryan Farrell: I mean the special master was kind to me and my family when we were in the courtroom. </p><p>Jon Wertheim: [The] court was intended to compensate people for vaccine injuries. I want to quote this, "quickly, easily, and with certainty and generosity." </p>
<p>Ryan Farrell: That couldn't be further from the truth. You know--</p><p>Jon Wertheim: What do you mean?</p><p>Ryan Farrell: I feel like they made it way too-- way too long. </p><p>Ryan remains unable to work. Six years in, the court has yet to determine his damages. </p><p>The court acknowledges the delays. Citing a backlog of more than 3,000 cases, its chief special master has, in documents obtained by 60 Minutes, asked Congress for more resources four years running, saying, "... it becomes more difficult each year to resolve the huge number of case filings in the expedient fashion they deserve." Congress has yet to act.</p><p>Our reporting suggests that this inaction is, in part, because vaccination has become such a loaded, heavily politicized issue that legislators are reluctant to wade in. </p><p>The Thompsons are not invested in the heavily-charged vaccine debate — they're invested in their son, Jacob — an anguishing exception, harmed by what's otherwise a public health force of good.</p>
<p>Jon Wertheim: I do wonder if people aren't going to hear your story and be terrified of giving their kids vaccinations.</p><p>John Thompson: We're definitely not anti-vaxxers. We think-- and-- I mean, vaccines are great. They've done a lot to help people. But I think that parents need to know what can happen. </p><p>Renée Gentry: If what you care about are vaccine-injured people, and them being compensated, then you want this court to work. And you want this court to be here.</p><p>Jon Wertheim: We have this program that incentivizes the manufacturing of vaccines, but also acknowledges that in some rare cases, there are injuries and damages. </p><p>Renée Gentry: Right. It's bipartisan. It takes everyone's views into account. And everybody compromises, which is a dirty word now. But that's the goal of it. And it's helped these people. Jacob will be taken care of for the rest of his life because of this program.</p><p><em>Produced by Denise Schrier Cetta. Associate producers, Elizabeth Germino and Arman Badrei.

<div class="article-title">Johnson, Schumer accuse each other of not being serious in shutdown negotiations</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington — </em>Congressional leaders traded blame for the <span class="link">government shutdown</span> on Sunday as the stalemate over how to reopen the government stretched into another week without progress on negotiations. </p><p>The Senate is set to reconvene Monday after dueling measures to fund the government <span class="link">fell short of the necessary support</span> for a fourth time on Friday, showing no sign of movement from either party. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson canceled plans for the lower chamber return to Washington this week in an effort to increase pressure on the Senate. </p><p>Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, <span class="link">said Sunday on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan</span>" that "the House did its job" by passing a measure last month that would fund the government until Nov. 21, saying the reason House Republicans will remain in their districts this week is "because we did that."</p><p>"I pray that more Democrats in the Senate will come to their senses and do the right thing, and when they have the next opportunity on Monday to vote to open the government. I surely hope that they will," Johnson said. </p>
<p>The <span class="link">House-passed measure</span> first <span class="link">failed in the Senate on Sept. 19</span>, with all but one Democrat opposing in favor of a separate measure to fund the government through October that also includes Democrats' health care priorities. Then, as the government was hours from shutting down last week, the <span class="link">Senate voted again on the measure</span>, when two more senators crossed the aisle to vote with Republicans in favor. But support for the bill still remained shy of the 60-votes required in the Senate. </p>
<p>Since then, Senate Republicans have been seeking to peel off Democratic support for their measure, while Democratic leaders have remained firm in their demand that a funding measure include an extension of health insurance tax credits. And in subsequent votes on Wednesday and Friday, Republicans were unable to pick up more support from Democrats on their bill. </p><p>Johnson said Republicans are ready to negotiate on the health insurance tax credits, but he said it's a complicated issue that will take time to address, pointing to possible reforms aimed at weeding out "a lot of fraud, waste and abuse."</p><p>"We're not saying that we won't negotiate it," Johnson said. "We're saying turn the lights back on in Congress."</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, <span class="link">who also appeared Sunday on "Face the Nation</span>," argued that Johnson is "not serious" about negotiating the health care issue, pointing to his move to keep the House away from Washington this week. And the New York Democrat urged that the only way the funding impasse will be resolved is with a meeting between congressional leaders and the president. </p>
<p>"We've been trying for months and months to sit down with them and have a serious conversation addressing America's healthcare needs, and they've refused and refused and refused," Schumer said. </p><p>Schumer and Johnson, along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, met with President Trump last week. But the meeting failed to produce an agreement to avert a shutdown ahead of the deadline. Schumer said Sunday that Mr. Trump "wasn't serious" in the meeting, after which the president posted what appeared to be an AI-generated video mocking the Democratic leaders.</p><p>"The American people know that they're in charge — Republican president, Republican Senate, Republican House — that they have a responsibility to govern, which means sit down and talk with us so we can address these needs," Schumer said. </p>

<div class="article-title">As justices confront harassment, death threats, Barrett says "I'm not afraid"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Whenever Justice Amy Coney Barrett arrived at an auditorium or a library or a university last month to discuss her new book, she encountered a familiar sight: protesters.</p><p>They lined the streets, chanting and carrying signs. One wore a handmaid's costume, a symbol of oppression. Another was dressed as liberal icon <span class="link">Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</span>, whose death in 2020 created a vacancy on the Supreme Court that President Trump would fill with <span class="link">Barrett</span>.</p><p>For Barrett, protesters have become routine, another logistical wrinkle in her everyday life, much like the ones who regularly gather at her home outside Washington, D.C., where she lives with her husband and younger children. What surprises her, she told me in a wide-ranging interview in her chambers late last month, is how she can let it roll off her back.</p><p>"If I had imagined before I was on the Court, how I would react to knowing that I was being protested, that would have seemed like a big deal, like, 'oh, my gosh, I'm being protested,'" she says. "But now I have the ability to be like, 'Oh, okay, well, are the entrances blocked?' I just feel very businesslike about it. It doesn't matter to me. It doesn't disrupt my emotions."</p><p>A fury of protests against conservative justices erupted in 2022, when news <span class="link">leaked</span> that the Court was poised to overturn the landmark decision Roe v. Wade. Barrett, a conservative in the mold of her former mentor and boss Antonin Scalia, was a particular source of ire. Replacing Ginsburg, whose legal career was grounded in women's rights, she provided a key fifth vote to overturn Roe and let each state decide whether to allow abortion or not. But the decision also unleashed something much darker.</p>
<p>On Friday, a California resident was <span class="link">sentenced to eight years</span> in prison for the <span class="link">attempted assassination</span> of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who also voted to overturn Roe. Court papers revealed the perpetrator had also mapped out the homes of three other conservative justices, including Barrett's. Death threats have not gone away, and security remains high at their homes and whenever they appear in public. </p><p>I asked Barrett if she is ever afraid. Her response was immediate and emphatic: "I'm not afraid."</p><p>"You can't live your life in fear," she continued. "And I think people who threaten — the goal is to cause fear. And I'm not afraid. I'm not going to reward threats with their intended reaction." </p><p>That kind of mental discipline and self control, even in the face of threats and extreme criticism, reflects an outlook that has guided the 53-year-old Barrett much of her life. </p>
<p>"I don't make decisions emotionally. I try very hard not to let emotions guide decisions in any aspect of my life. The way that I respond to people, the choices that we make," she continues, adding with a laugh, "apart from maybe some impulse buys of clothes or something." </p><p>That outlook is also reflected in her approach to the law. </p><p>On the Supreme Court, Barrett's opinions are highly analytical. She doesn't like to decide more than the issue at hand, which is one reason she has parted ways with conservative colleagues who would rather swing for the fences, like in a case two terms ago when the Court ruled states cannot remove Trump from the ballot. Barrett agreed on the bottom line, but had a more limited approach. </p><p>As a former law professor, she can be formalistic and technical, qualities that also can separate her from other conservatives, as in a 2024 case that attempted to hold the Biden administration responsible for suppressing speech on social media during Covid.</p><p>Now entering her sixth year on the Court, Barrett continues to defy stereotypes. Critics span the political spectrum, not only Democrats after she voted to overturn Roe, but more recently Republicans in the wake of decisions at odds with President Trump. She is "confounding the Right and the Left," as the New York Times put it, raising hopes and fears on both sides.</p><p>That's partly because, in decades past, some conservative justices have turned out to be anything but conservative. Would Barrett, too, go that route? And it's also in part because of a fundamental misunderstanding about the Court, reflecting an idea that the justices are mere political actors who should stay on their respective sides, regardless of the law.</p><p>"That is a notion that I try to disabuse people of in the book," she says. </p>
<p>Correcting some of those public misperceptions that the Supreme Court is driven by politics or outcomes or is loyal to Trump is one of her main goals with her new book, "Listening to the Law." She is part teacher, part tour guide, taking the reader inside the Court and highlighting some of its most controversial decisions to explain how the justices interpret the Constitution and the differences in conservative and liberal philosophies. </p><p>And there is no case more controversial than the 5-4 decision overturning Roe, <span class="link">Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Whole Health</span>. Barrett uses it to explain how she and the Court's conservative majority interpret the Constitution with a method known as "originalism," focusing on the Constitution's original meaning, the way the public understood it when it was adopted.</p><p>In our interview, Barrett said she was drawn to originalism when she read Justice Scalia's opinions in a constitutional law class during her second year at Notre Dame Law School. She said she was frustrated after a first-year criminal law class, reading liberal decisions of the Warren Court and finding them to be "unmoored." Scalia's opinions, with his originalist framework, made sense to her.</p><p>"I think I am different in style than Justice Scalia. I don't think I'm different in substance," she said. "I think one thing that was important to Justice Scalia is fidelity to his analytical framework, so fidelity to textualism and originalism, even when it led to places that he didn't want to go." </p><p>Scalia, for example, upheld flag burning as a First Amendment right, even though he said "if I were king, I would not." With Barrett, an example is the death penalty. She upholds it as constitutional, even though it is at odds with her religious views. </p><p>And that framework, she says, is how she approaches the cases involving Trump. While politicians, the media and the public are focused on the current occupant of the office, she says "the Court has to take the long view."</p><p>"The way that we have to view cases is about the presidency, not about the president. We have to make a decision that's going to apply to six presidents from now, and that's how I try to view the law," she says. "So in the same way that I do try to erase particular policies, or substitute in ones that I like or dislike — to try to maintain neutrality — I try to do that with the presidents too, because it can't turn on the president."</p>
<p>Her critics aren't convinced, but Barrett seems unfazed by the attacks on her judgment or her character. In our conversation, and in multiple interviews with those who know her, she comes across as someone with a strong sense of self and an equally clear view on the right way to interpret the Constitution. Unlike some justices, she says she doesn't monitor what journalists and law professors and politicians say about the Court. She has seen them get it wrong. It doesn't matter to her.</p><p>"If I could have, especially as a 16-year-old, imagined that I would not care or be impervious to being criticized and mocked, I would have been very surprised," she says. "And so I am glad, because I think this would be a miserable job if you let yourself care, if you let yourself be affected." </p><p>Barrett first walked through the fire after Trump nominated her in 2017 to the Chicago-based federal appeals court. In her Senate hearings, she withstood withering attacks on her faith, notably when then-Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told her, "the dogma lives loudly within you." Her steely performance impressed conservatives and helped get her on Trump's Supreme Court shortlist. </p><p>Barrett was astonished by how she was portrayed by the media. (She said a cousin told her "the person they were describing is not the person that I've known my whole life at all.")</p><p>A mother of seven, Barrett is a devout Catholic and proud daughter from a large and supportive family with deep roots in New Orleans. Before becoming an appeals court judge, she was a popular and respected Notre Dame law professor with sparkling credentials. Always a high achiever, she had received full scholarships to college and law school at Notre Dame, where she was top in her class (and met her future husband) and earned highly competitive clerkships with towering conservative icons, Judge Laurence Silberman and Scalia.</p><p>"One thing that I really disliked was this idea that I had no backbone, or that I was just this subservient woman in some way," she said, "because I felt like I am anything but that."</p><p>She had set goals for her life early on, and she made conscious and methodical choices to reach them. She wanted a big family like she grew up with, but, of course, she would work, so she wanted flexibility in her career. </p>
<p>"I really admired my parents, I really admired my grandparents, and I thought, if I want to be the kind of people that they are, I have to make definite choices," she told me. "I have to decide what my values are, what my priorities are, and make definite choices and prioritize those kinds of things." </p><p>Thinking about law school after college, she says she remembers sitting in her dorm room at Rhodes College and making a list of pros and cons, focusing on what mattered to her and "I just reasoned my way to it." (Barrett, always analytical, mentions in her book that her life runs on to-do lists, but she also is partial to pro/con lists.)</p><p>She's now the only justice on the Court who didn't attend an Ivy League school, but Barrett says she didn't care about labels or what was considered "the best school." She didn't even apply to Harvard. She opted for Notre Dame over the University of Chicago, for instance, not only because she could prioritize her Catholic faith, but that it also offered a full scholarship. That meant no big student loans that would force her into an all-consuming, high-paying law firm job after graduation. </p><p>Searching for a more accurate way to describe herself, Barrett uses the term "Steel Magnolia." </p><p>"I've done a lot of traditionally feminine things. I have a large family. I've made unconventional choices in that way. And I'm not sorry to be feminine," she said. "But I don't feel like I have to sacrifice that part. I think you can be traditional in some of those ways, and still have grit or the backbone or the spine. I felt like I had the grit." </p><p>"Grit" is a word she uses more than once in the book when talking about strong women she admires, like her great-grandmother, a widow who raised 13 children in a tiny house "bursting at the seams" during the Great Depression. "Somehow she always managed to find the resources, space and time," Barrett writes.  </p><p>Throughout our conversation, I'm struck by something she wrote early in the book, when she mentions advice her father gave to her and her siblings: "Control your emotions, or your emotions will control you." </p>
<p>It's similar to advice Justice Ginsburg liked to share from her mother: "Don't be distracted by emotions like anger, envy, resentment. These just zap energy and waste time." Ginsburg would say her advice came in handy at the Court, because she learned that reacting with "anger or annoyance will not advance one's ability to persuade."  </p><p>I asked Barrett if she, like Ginsburg, drew on that advice at the Court. </p><p>"Yes, in this job, I think it's part of the tuning out, that I can't let what people say…certainly not affect the decisions that I make, but even affect how I feel," she says. "If I let that in, and then let that affect my mood when I go home or when I'm relating to people, then that needs to be kept out." </p><p>Having that mindset, Barrett says, is one of the things she's most proud of as justice, because that wasn't how she felt as a young teenager growing up in a family of nine. </p><p>"I felt very conspicuous. We would go into restaurants, and you could see people turning around and counting and looking," she says. "In the preteen and teenage self-conscious years, I thought, I just want to be unnoticed. I'm never gonna have a family that attracts attention."</p><p>Barrett rarely shows the kind of rhetorical fire or hyperbole some of her colleagues regularly exhibit. Stylistically, as she says, she is no Scalia. But with the Court increasingly under strain as it grapples with dozens of emergency requests from the Trump administration, Barrett exhibited a flash of pique last term, responding to a fiery dissent by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in the case limiting the use of nationwide injunctions.</p><p>Jackson, a Biden appointee and the Court's newest member, accused the Court of engaging in "legalese." Barrett, speaking for the majority, responded: "We will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries with of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself." </p>
<p>In the months since, Jackson has only ratcheted up her rhetoric as the Court has issued temporary orders in a range of cases brought by the Trump Administration. In one emergency order last month, on whether Trump could cancel grants to the National Institutes of Health, Jackson impugned the conservatives' motives. </p><p>Jackson accused them of having "no fixed rules" except "this Administration always wins" something Barrett pointed out in an event last month was obviously false. (Just one high-profile example: The Court ruled against the Administration's deportation of Kilmar Albrego Garcia and ordered it to work toward his return to the U.S.)</p><p>Still, Barrett insists that kind of language doesn't affect her relationship with Jackson, and that she works to have relationships with all the other justices. She says she enjoys talking about the law with Justice Elena Kagan, also a former law professor who, like Barrett has a more formalistic approach to the law than the Court's two other liberals, even though it leads them to very different places.</p><p>In a recent interview, Bari Weiss of The Free Press asked Barrett to give one word for each of her colleagues. For Kagan, Barrett chose "analytical." That's a word she also used in our conversation to describe herself.</p><p>"You can't take it personally, and so I think you just have to understand and see opinions for what they are: disagreements about ideas," Barrett said of the dissents. "I intend my opinions to be about the ideas, not about the people, and I think a big part of life is assuming the best of other people."</p><p>Barrett doesn't seem like a person who dwells in regret. But she said she saw a "missed opportunity" on her cross-country book tour, and she wished she'd emphasized how the emergency orders in the Trump cases are different. Always a teacher, she wants to explain these orders aren't the last word.</p><p>"I don't think the public is really aware this isn't the final decision. If a district court enters a preliminary injunction, and we enter a stay of that preliminary injunction, it's not saying the administration wins," she says. "It's simply saying that the administration…can continue to pursue whatever policy it is, because it has not been finally decided yet." </p>
<p>In other words, she says, these interim orders — whether they're allowing Mr. Trump to cut grants or foreign aid or fire political appointees from federal agencies — are short-term, preliminary decisions. The Court is allowing Mr. Trump to pursue those policies for now, but if he ultimately loses on the underlying merits, the aid money will have to be spent and the employees reinstated with back pay.</p><p>And Mr. Trump, I said, may not win them all? </p><p>"Right," Barrett said.</p><p>It may look different, I asked, once you're deciding the merits?</p><p>"100 percent," she said. </p><p>For now, one factor weighing in Mr. Trump's favor is the Court's assessment of the harm caused when unelected judges reflexively block policies enacted by popularly elected representatives. Because litigation can take years to resolve, those policies may never end up taking effect. The harm caused by judicial interference, the Court has explained, is to the democratic process.</p><p>"The case that we always cite is Maryland v. King, and it points out that any time a policy of one of the politically accountable branches or politically accountable state legislatures or governor is stopped, that, in itself, is an irreparable harm because you are affecting the people," she says. "It was the people's preferred policy. The president is the one that they elected. The members of whatever legislature, state or Congress, are the ones that people elected." </p>
<p>"I may disagree, or agree, with whatever choices the people have made in the selection of their representatives," she said. "But the people have made this choice."</p><p>Beyond the obvious strain on the Court, the unprecedented crush of emergency appeals also has put pressure on lower court judges, and some have complained publicly that the Court's brief orders aren't giving them enough guidance. But Barrett, always methodical, says more guidance at the preliminary stage would come at a cost, raising the risk of locking the Court into its views before it has fully considered the issues. </p><p>"I do think opinions are important," she says. "I don't know that it's always valuable to have an interim opinion that comes before the final opinion."</p><p>Barrett, like all the justices when speaking in public, is exceedingly careful with her words. She won't discuss any upcoming issues or cases, or give any hint on how the Court may see the underlying merits. Even her book tour seemed like an exercise in not making news, and she succeeded.</p><p>But she will have that opportunity soon enough: The justices already have agreed to decide whether Mr. Trump can impose far-ranging tariffs and fire members of certain federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board. In the interim, it's allowing him to pursue tariffs and fire some Biden-appointed commissioners, though not on the Fed. Other cases, including birthright citizenship, are on the horizon.</p><p>Beyond the Trump cases, the Court this term also will confront controversial cases on gun rights, voting rights, campaign finance reform and whether students who identify as transgender can play girls sports. The tensions and commentary will not ease anytime soon.</p><p>For Barrett, that means staying the course, following her own internal compass and tuning out the noise, because one thing is certain. Whatever the Court decides in any of the cases, she says, "somebody's going to be mad." It's a part of her life now.</p>
<p>"I just think you have to know who you are," she says, "and make decisions that you decide are right, and stick with your priorities and not worry about the feedback you get from others, whether it's negative or whether it's positive."</p>

<div class="article-title">Ex-NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez stabbed in altercation leading to charges against him</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>INDIANAPOLIS — Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez was pepper-sprayed and stabbed multiple times during a late-night altercation with a 69-year-old truck driver in a downtown Indianapolis alley, which resulted in criminal charges against the Fox Sports analyst, according to court records filed Sunday.</p> <p>Based on hotel video footage of the altercation early Saturday and the driver's statement to police, a police affidavit alleges that Sanchez, smelling of alcohol, accosted the driver of a box truck that backed into a hotel's loading docks, leading to a confrontation outside the vehicle that prompted the driver to defensively pull out a knife.</p>
<p>Sanchez was hospitalized with stab wounds to his upper right torso, the affidavit signed by a police detective said. Sanchez remained hospitalized early Sunday, according to police. The truck driver, identified as P.T., had a cut to his left cheek, it said.</p> <p>Sanchez was in stable condition, Fox Sports said Saturday. There was no immediate update Sunday.</p> <p>His initial court hearing was set for Tuesday in a Marion County courtroom.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Sanchez stabbed multiple times</h3> <p>As the altercation escalated, the driver feared "'this guy is trying to kill me'" and pulled his knife as Sanchez came at him, the affidavit said. Sanchez was initially stabbed two or three times, then stabbed again when he went at the driver again, it said.</p> <p>"The next thing P.T. knew was Mr. Sanchez looked at him with a look of shock, he slowly turned around, and Mr. Sanchez took off northbound in the alley," the document said.</p> <p>Sanchez was in Indianapolis to call Sunday's Raiders-Colts game. Instead, he was charged with battery resulting in injury, unauthorized entry of a motor vehicle and public intoxication — all misdemeanors. Police got a warrant to obtain Sanchez's phone and clothes from the hospital, the document said.</p> <p>There were no immediate court records indicating whether Sanchez had legal representation yet.</p>
<p>Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears said Sunday that his office would "follow the facts and the law wherever they lead."</p> <p>"What began as a disagreement between a 38-year-old former professional athlete and a 69-year-old man should not have escalated into violence or left anyone seriously injured," Mears said in a statement.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Fox Sports announcers acknowledge Sanchez's absence Sunday</h3> <p>Sanchez told police at the hospital that all he could remember was grabbing for a window, the court document said. Sanchez said he didn't know who else was involved or where the altercation happened.</p> <p>"Friday night in Indianapolis, one of our team members, Mark Sanchez, was involved in an incident that, to be honest, we are still trying to wrap our heads around," Curt Menefee said Sunday on Fox's primary NFL pregame show. "At this time our thoughts and prayers are with Mark and his family and all of those involved."</p> <p>Fox Sports play-by-play announcer Chris Myers also acknowledged Sanchez's absence on Sunday before introducing Sanchez's replacement, Brady Quinn. Myers said he wanted to send thoughts and prayers to Sanchez and everyone involved in the incident.</p> <p>Police officers found Sanchez with the stab wounds when they were dispatched to a downtown pub about 12:35 a.m. Saturday. The truck driver was found in the alley.</p> <p>Details of the confrontation were disclosed in the affidavit, based on video footage and the truck driver's statement to police.</p> <p>The video showed a man believed to be Sanchez running in the alley toward the truck, the affidavit said. The driver works for a company that specializes in commercial cooking oil recycling and disposal, and he was performed his work duties, it said.</p> <p>Sanchez opened the truck door and began talking to the driver, the affidavit said. Sanchez told the driver he couldn't be at the loading dock and that Sanchez had spoken to the hotel manager, the document said. Sanchez smelled of alcohol and his speech was slurred, the driver told police.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Affidavit says Sanchez threw truck driver to ground</h3> <p>Sanchez followed the driver from side to side of the truck, the court document said. When the driver darted toward the driver's door, video showed Sanchez "grabbing and throwing" the driver toward a hotel wall, it said. The fight continued against a dumpster and Sanchez threw the driver to the ground, it said.</p> <p>Sanchez climbed into the truck but got out when told by the driver he wasn't allowed in, it said. Sanchez repeated that he spoke to a manager and didn't want the driver to replace fryer oil, the document said. Sanchez tried again to get into the truck and blocked the driver from calling his manager, it said.</p> <p>Believing he was in danger, the driver grabbed pepper spray from his pocket and sprayed Sanchez's face, it said. Sanchez wiped his face and advanced toward the driver again, it said.</p> <p>The driver then pulled his knife and stabbed Sanchez as the ex-quarterback came at him, it said. The driver fell onto pallets on the ground, he told police.</p> <p>"While P.T. was on the ground, he could only see the feet of Mr. Sanchez coming at him, making P.T. realize that he was in a life-or-death situation," the affidavit said.</p> <p>The driver made it to his feet and stabbed Sanchez the last time as Sanchez came at him, it said.</p> <p>Sanchez had a 10-year NFL career before retiring in 2019. He appeared on ABC and ESPN for two years before joining Fox Sports as a game analyst in 2021. The Long Beach, California, native starred at Southern California before he was selected by the New York Jets with the fifth pick in the 2009 NFL draft. Sanchez also appeared in games with Philadelphia, Dallas and Washington.</p> <p>Sanchez is married to actor Perry Mattfeld, a former USC cheerleader whose credits include <em>Shameless</em>, <em>In the Dark</em> and <em>Chad Powers</em>. She told Glamour recently that the couple had twin daughters in March.</p>

<div class="article-title">An unusual 'village' aims to help people leave long-term homelessness for good</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>MURRAY, Utah — On a weekday morning, about two dozen formerly homeless men and women file into a small room at The Other Side Village near Salt Lake City.</p> <p>"How have you felt since our last meeting?" asks Melissa Hepworth, a fellow resident here who tells the group that she's felt "challenged with a little bit of shame."</p> <p>The people in this meeting have all been chronically unhoused — typically living outside for eight to nine years with significant addiction or mental illness. They are among the hardest to help, and that's exactly who the Village has targeted since it opened two years ago.</p>
<p>"Once you've forgotten how to work, forgotten how to engage with other people, forgotten how to solve human problems, forgotten how to manage finances, it takes a lot of work to restore some of those abilities," says Joseph Grenny, a co-founder of The Other Side Village.</p>
<p>Across the country, much-needed housing and treatment programs for the unhoused are in short supply. There's also heated debate over which should be a bigger priority, with President Trump calling for forced treatment. </p> <p>This ambitious project in Utah offers short-term housing, rehab and mental health treatment, along with a kind of training program. People start in a prep school that teaches life skills for those who may have lost them. They must get and stay sober and are also required to work. </p> <p>The Village runs businesses to help create jobs for that. After six to 12 months, fellow residents vote to decide when someone is ready to "graduate." At that point, they can move on to their own place, in tiny cottages the Village is building for permanent housing.</p> <p>"We believe that human beings change when they're in an environment that expects something of them," Grenny says. "When we succeed in doing hard things, we start to feel good about ourselves."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">There are coaches who've been there themselves</h3> <p>The conversation at morning meetings is meant to build community, because supporting each other is a big part of the therapy here. Resident Patricia Jean Martin says it feels like starting a new life with people she can "actually trust, be honest with, be accountable with."</p>
<p>But that process can also be intense. "You do have to listen to the feedback, and just work on it and change your behaviors," she says. "And if you don't, you will be kicked out."</p> <p>To help with that change, there are coaches who know exactly what people are going through.</p> <p>"I was introduced to drugs by one of my mom's boyfriends, probably around nine or ten years old," says coach Jackie Tress. After that came a car wreck and prescription pain pills, and then things really spiraled. Eventually she lost her house and daughter, living for years on the street and in and out of jail.</p> <p>"Every time I got arrested I would think, all right, this is it, I'm done. And I would be provided resources," she says. "But as soon as I hit the street, I would go right back to what I knew."</p>
<p>Things changed when she went through The Other Side program herself, and could not believe one of the directors had also been homeless and addicted. "Because I only saw the woman that was in front of me," she says. "She just had such purpose and grace and I'm like, OK, if she can do it, I can do it."</p> <p>To drive home this transformation, the common area of the prep school has photos of Jackie and other coaches when they first exited homelessness. She looks exhausted in her photo, with red marks on her face and deep bags below her eyes — nothing at all like now.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">"Not something usually available to people who are homeless"</h3> <p>The Other Side began a decade ago as training to reintegrate people with a long history of crime and other troubles. But Grenny and other co-founders saw a growing need for a separate program to specifically address chronic homelessness. </p> <p>That's defined as when someone with a disability, including addiction or mental illness, has been without housing for at least a year straight, or repeatedly over several years. The number of chronically homeless people in the U.S. hit a record high last year of more than 150,000, mostly living outside.</p> <p>"Trying to recover from substance abuse, and you're homeless and you're on the street or you're in a shelter, it's very tough," says Dennis Culhane, who researches homelessness at the University of Pennsylvania. </p> <p>Typical shelter-based programs may only house people at night, leaving them essentially still homeless during the day, he says. There's little structure, certainly no jobs, and dropout rates are high. Meanwhile there's very little residential rehab, and it's usually for people who have private insurance or can pay out of pocket.</p>
<p>So the Utah program "is not something usually available to people who are homeless. It's pretty unique in my mind," he says.</p> <p>For the lucky few who can get it, federally subsidized permanent supportive housing also offers treatment for addiction and mental illness. But it's optional — not mandatory — and Culhane says while that works for most, it's not for everyone.</p> <p>"I did a study in supported housing in New York City," he says. "And about 30% of the people wanted to be in a clean and sober environment. So I think we need every option possible."</p> <p>Still, Culhane says The Other Side Village model is expensive and may be hard to scale up, especially since the sober and work requirements bar federal funding.</p>
<p>The program aims to eventually become self-sufficient through the businesses it runs. But to launch, it has raised money from donors and gotten several million dollars in state funding. It's also leasing a large patch of city-owned land for a dollar a year.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Creating community and jobs for the long term</h3> <p>In a wide open dirt field on that land in Salt Lake City, The Other Side Village CEO Preston Cochrane stands near rows of new tiny cottages. There are 60 completed so far, where the first graduates from the prep school moved in less than a year ago. The plan in the next few years is to double prep school enrollment and build hundreds more cottages.</p> <p>"We have coaches that live on site as well, just like the prep school," he says. There's also a neighborhood council and regular resident meetings. "It's a supportive community. For many of them it becomes their family."</p> <p>There's an income limit, but otherwise people can stay here as long as they want.</p>
<p>A health clinic is also under construction that will include mental health services and dentistry, and there will be a grocery store. Both places will offer jobs for residents. </p> <p>Cochrane says that "100% of the folks who live here maintain a sober lifestyle. They pay rent and they work." </p> <p>Jennifer Davis loves her tiny cottage home, and her job a short drive away at The Other Side Donuts. The store and the donuts are whimsical and full of color. "People are like, 'Oh, wow,' and they gasp," she says. "It's a bright spot."</p>
<p>Davis once had a professional career and owned a condo but says she spent years lost, without housing, family or friends. She's now the donut store's wholesale logistics manager and says she's grateful for the chance to start over.</p>
<p>"It proves to myself that I can have a career again. I didn't ruin it all with my choices," she says. "I can do a great job. I can be a professional leader."</p>

<div class="article-title">Federal workers sue Education Department over partisan shutdown emails</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting language into Department of Education employees' out-of-office email messages blaming Democrats for the government shutdown.</p> <p>"Forcing civil servants to speak on behalf of the political leadership's partisan agenda is a blatant violation of federal employees' First Amendment rights," said the complaint, which was filed by the American Federation of Government Employees in federal district court in Washington, D.C., on Friday.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is the first to challenge the administration's unusual use of partisan messaging in government communications during the shutdown, which legal experts told NPR may violate federal ethics laws.</p> <p>The White House began pointing the finger at Democrats as the government shut down on Oct. 1 after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement to fund operations. Messages posted on agency websites and in emails to federal workers across multiple Cabinet departments blamed congressional Democrats and, in some cases, the "Radical Left" for the shutdown and its impacts. (Republicans control both chambers of Congress but need Democratic support in the Senate to approve any government funding deal.)</p>
<p>Many Department of Education employees who were furloughed due to the shutdown were surprised to see the following message inserted into their out-of-office replies: "Thank you for contacting me. On September 19, 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse in appropriations, I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume."</p>
<p>Multiple employees told NPR that although the message was written in the first person and sent from their email, they did not write it and were not told it would replace whatever out-of-office message they had originally set up.</p> <p>The language also differed from the model language the department had provided to staffers as they prepared for the shutdown, according to the lawsuit. Some staffers who tried to change their out-of-office messages to remove the partisan language found they were changed back, the lawsuit said.</p> <p>The lawsuit argues the messages violate the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from compelling speech. It names the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon as defendants.</p> <p>"Without giving notice to their employees, let alone obtaining their consent, the Department of Education has replaced employees' out-of-office email messages with partisan language that blames 'Democrat Senators' for the shutdown," the complaint said. "Employees are now forced to involuntarily parrot the Trump Administration's talking points with emails sent out in their names."</p>
<p>In response to NPR's request for comment on the lawsuit, the Education Department press team replied with the same automated out-of-office message. In a statement to NBC News on Thursday, before the lawsuit was filed, Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications, said: "The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where's the lie?"</p>
<p>Government ethics experts have said that the inclusion of overtly political messages in federal agency communications could violate the Hatch Act, which limits political activity by civil servants in the executive branch.</p> <p>"The Hatch Act prohibits engaging in political activity while in an official capacity, including communication that contains advocacy in opposition to a political party," Michael Fallings, a partner at Tully Rinckey, an employment law firm, said in a statement. "Here, while the reference to Democrats alone likely does not constitute a violation, the explicit blaming of the Democratic Party for the shutdown and 'reference to radical left' may constitute a violation."</p> <p>On Thursday, Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, asked the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency which enforces the Hatch Act, to investigate the Trump administration's use of agency websites and official government emails "to promote a false, partisan Republican political agenda." (The Office of Special Counsel is being led by an acting director since President Trump fired its Senate-confirmed leader before the end of his term. The agency is closed during the shutdown, according to its website.)</p> <p>More than two dozen current and former federal workers contacted NPR in recent days to express concern about the politicized language they are seeing from agencies and officials.</p>
<p>"As a professional civil servant and human being I find the rhetoric shocking, offensive, and jarring," said one federal worker who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from the Trump administration for speaking publicly.</p> <p>Six people shared screenshots of a weekly newsletter the Department of Veterans Affairs sends to "Veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors." Titled "How the government shutdown impacts VA," the Oct. 1 newsletter said: "President Trump opposes a lapse in appropriations, and on September 19, the House of Representatives passed, with the Trump Administration's support, a clean continuing resolution to fund the government through November 21. Unfortunately, Democrats are blocking this Continuing Resolution in the U.S. Senate due to unrelated policy demands." It went on to list VA services that would be affected.</p> <p>"I think the politicization of a VA newsletter which is intended only to let us know of our benefits should also be reported on," a veteran who received the newsletter and requested anonymity because they fear reprisal from the government told NPR.</p> <p>"The message was 100% factual, and even mainstream media outlets and reporters say the same thing," VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement in response to NPR's questions about the newsletter and the concerns veterans expressed about politicization.</p> <p><em>NPR's Cory Turner contributed reporting.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Federal judge again blocks National Guard deployment to Oregon</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A federal judge late Sunday night blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon, including hundreds of out-of-state soldiers.</p> <p>In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut barred any National Guard members from being relocated from any state for service in Oregon. The ruling came as Portland and Chicago prepared for the possibility that National Guard members will be deployed to their streets, as President Trump moves ahead with his plan to send troops to Democratic-run U.S. cities that he says require help to control crime and protect federal law enforcement officers.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the White House said Trump "authorized" the deployment of 300 Illinois National Guard members, after vowing for weeks to send federal forces into Chicago. Earlier in the weekend, Immergut temporarily blocked the administration's plan to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland, though troops had arrived in Oregon from California.</p> <p>Guard members will be used to protect federal property as well as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Federal Protective Service agents and other federal employees, according to a copy of a federal memo viewed by NPR. They will be sent to places where there are "violent demonstrations" in the state or where they are likely to occur based on "current threat assessments," the memo said.</p> <p>Already this year, the Trump administration has sent National Guard members to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Trump has said he also intends to send troops to Memphis with the backing of Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee.</p>
<p>The new deployment effort comes against the wishes of the Democratic governors of Oregon and Illinois, Tina Kotek and JB Pritzker, who say the Guard deployment is unnecessary and will escalate tensions.</p> <p>On Saturday, Pritzker wrote in a post on X that the "Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will." Pritzker added: "It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will."</p>
<p>In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that Trump had activated the troops "[a]midst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness" in Chicago in order to "protect federal officers and assets," WBEZ reported. Trump has said National Guard deployments are in an effort to fight crime, despite violent crime being down in Chicago and other cities.</p> <p>On Saturday, Border Patrol agents shot a woman in Chicago. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said the woman was one of a group of drivers who rammed federal agents with their vehicles. The woman, Marimar Martinez, was released from the hospital and is now in the custody of the FBI, DHS said in a statement. No agents were seriously injured, according to McLaughlin.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A judge blocks Trump's effort in Portland, but Guard members arrive from California</h3> <p>Also on Saturday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying the Oregon National Guard.</p> <p>U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut ruled that the government had failed to meet the threshold for declaring that recent protests outside an ICE facility in Portland constituted a rebellion.</p>
<p>Immergut, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, said protests at the facility since July were generally limited to fewer than 30 people and were "largely sedate." She added that the city's police force was trained in crowd management and could seek the assistance of other law enforcement agencies — and even the National Guard — if it needed to.</p> <p>The Trump administration federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard last Sunday for a 60-day deployment, according to a memo sent to Gov. Kotek from the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>As in Chicago, Trump was planning to send the troops to Portland over the objections of state and local leaders.</p> <p>Trump said Sunday he hadn't seen the judge's order, but that "that judge ought to be ashamed of themselves."</p> <p>Despite the judge's ruling, Guard members were en route to Oregon, according to California Gov. Gavin Newsom. He said in a post on X that the Trump administration had sent 300 California National Guard personnel to the state's northern neighbor.</p> <p>"They are on their way there now," Newsom wrote. "We are taking this fight back to court. The public cannot stay silent in the face of such reckless and authoritarian conduct by the President of the United States."</p>
<p>Kotek said on Sunday that 101 California Guard members arrived on Saturday in Oregon and more were on their way. "This action appears to [be] intentional to circumvent yesterday's ruling by a federal judge," she said in a statement.</p> <p><em>Gigi Douban and Tom Bowman contributed reporting.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">SNL roasts Trump in season premiere, as Bad Bunny addresses Super Bowl criticism</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth bore the brunt of jokes during Saturday Night Live's Season 51 premiere on Saturday, which featured musician Bad Bunny as a host.</p> <p>The show opened with a skit mocking Hegseth, portrayed by comedian Colin Jost, ridiculing the Defense Secretary's address to military leaders in Quantico, Virginia, last week.</p> <p>"You don't want to follow the rules? Hey, no problem. You know who's going to want your sick, twisted, fat ass? ICE," Jost said, referring to Hegseth's comments about Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. "Got a sign-up sheet for ICE in the hallway, check them out. 'Cause in here, from now on, we're doing Army and Army only…".</p>
<p>Later in the sketch, Trump, played by James Austin Johnson, interrupted Hegseth and said, "I'm just here, keeping my eye on SNL, making sure they don't do anything too mean about me."</p> <p>"And they better be careful, because I know late-night TV like the back of my hand," he said, while holding up a bruised hand – referencing photographs which have shown bruising on Trump's hands. The White House has said the bruising is a result of aspirin and shaking hands frequently.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, he said SNL should be on their "best behavior" or they would have to answer to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr. Then, Mikey Day as Carr walked out on stage to the Rockwell song "Somebody's Watching Me."</p> <p>Trump has criticized SNL several times in the past, suggesting that the FCC and Federal Election Commission "look into" the show's coverage of him in 2019.</p>
<p>Superstar musician Bad Bunny, who was the guest host, addressed the criticism that followed after he was tapped by the NFL to headline the Super Bowl halftime show in February.</p> <p>"I'm very happy, and I think everyone is happy about it, even Fox News," Bad Bunny joked. "But really, I'm very excited to be doing the Super Bowl, and I know that people all around the world who love my music are also happy."</p>
<p>The Puerto Rican superstar then continued in Spanish, saying, "Especially all the Latinos and Latinas across the world, and here, in the United States, all those who have worked to open doors."</p> <p>"It's more than an achievement for myself, it's an achievement for all of us… It shows our footprint, and our contribution to this country, that no one will ever be able to take away or erase," he said before switching back to English. "And if you didn't understand what I just said, you have four months to learn."</p> <p>Last month, the Puerto Rican musician said he had decided not to include the U.S. in his upcoming world tour in case there were immigration raids at his concerts.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said during an interview with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson last week that ICE agents will be "all over that place" when asked if they would be at the Super Bowl.</p> <p>Also in the opening skit, Johnson's Trump said to Jost's Hegseth: "May every day be another wonderful secret… That was a quote from a poem I wrote to a horrible man I've never met before." He was quoting lines which Trump allegedly wrote in a 50th birthday card to deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — though the president has denied writing in the card.</p> <p>Later on, in the show's "Weekend Update" section, hosted by Jost and Michael Che, there were jokes about the government shutdown, as well as jibes about New York City Mayor Eric Adams ending his reelection bid.</p> <p>NPR reached out to the White House for comment on Sunday and received an automatic response via email blaming Democrats for the government shutdown the administration says is resulting in a delay in responses.</p> <p>White House Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson later told NPR in a statement that "reacting to this would require me to waste my time watching it, and like the millions of Americans who have tuned out from SNL, I have more entertaining things to do - like watch paint dry."</p>

<div class="article-title">States are cutting Medicaid provider payments long before Trump cuts hit</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Every day for nearly 18 years, Alessandra Fabrello has been a medical caregiver for her son, on top of being his mom.</p> <p>"It is almost impossible to explain what it takes to keep a child alive who should be dead," said Fabrello, whose son, Ysadore Maklakoff, experienced a rare brain condition called acute necrotizing encephalopathy at 9 months old.</p> <p>Through North Carolina's Medicaid program, Maklakoff qualifies for a large slate of medical care in the family's home in Chapel Hill. Fabrello said she works with staffing agencies to arrange services. She also learned to give the care ordinarily performed by a doctor, skilled nurse, or highly trained therapist because she often can't get help.</p>
<p>Now, broad cuts to North Carolina Medicaid will make finding and paying for care even more difficult. Medicaid is government health insurance for people with low incomes or disabilities and both state and federal dollars pay for the program.</p>
<p>Nationwide, states are scrambling to close budget shortfalls and are eyeing Medicaid, generally one of a state's biggest costs — even before President Donald Trump's hulking tax-and-spending law decreases federal spending on Medicaid by about $1 trillion over the next decade.</p> <p>North Carolina and Idaho have already announced plans to cut Medicaid payments to health care providers, including hospitals, doctors, and caregivers.</p> <p>In Michigan and Pennsylvania — where lawmakers have yet to pass budgets this year — spending on Medicaid is part of those debates. In Washington state, lawmakers approved cuts to the program that will not affect who is eligible, said Hayden Mackley, a spokesperson for the state's Office of Financial Management.</p> <h3 class="edTag">N.C. cuts underway</h3> <p>North Carolina's Medicaid agency instituted a minimum 3% reduction in pay for all providers who treat Medicaid patients on Oct. 1. Primary care doctors face an 8% cut and specialty doctors a 10% drop in payments, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.</p> <p>Fabrello said her son's dentist already called to say the office will not accept Medicaid patients come November. Fabrello fears dental work will become another service her son qualifies for but can't get because there aren't enough providers who accept Medicaid coverage.</p>
<p>Occupational and speech therapy, nursing care, and respite care are all difficult or impossible to get, she said. In a good week, her son will get 50 hours of skilled nursing care out of the 112 hours he qualifies for.</p> <p>"When you say, 'We're just cutting provider rates,' you're actually cutting access for him for all his needs," Fabrello said.</p> <p>Shannon Dowler, former chief medical officer for North Carolina Medicaid, said that reduced payments to dentists and other providers will lower the number of providers in the state's Medicaid network and result in "an immediate loss of access to care, worse outcomes, and cause higher downstream costs."</p>
<p>The cuts in North Carolina "don't have anything to do" with the new federal law that cuts Medicaid funding, Dowler said.</p> <p>"This is like the layers of the onion," she said. "We are hurting ourselves in North Carolina way ahead of the game, way before we need to do this." North Carolina alone is projected to lose about $23 billion in federal Medicaid dollars over the next decade.</p> <p>More than 3 million North Carolinians are enrolled in Medicaid. Deadlocked state lawmakers agreed to a mini budget in July to continue funding state programs that gave the Medicaid agency $319 million less than it requested. Lawmakers can choose to reinstate funding for Medicaid this fiscal year, Dowler said.</p> <p>"We all hope it changes," Dowler said, adding that if it does not, "you're going to see practices dropping coverage of Medicaid members."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Tough options</h3> <p>Each year since at least 2019, North Carolina's Medicaid agency has asked for more money than it received from the state legislature. A variety of federal resources, including money provided to states during the COVID-19 pandemic, helped bridge the gap.</p> <p>But those funds are gone this year, leaving the agency with a choice: Eliminate some optional parts of the program or force every provider that accepts the public insurance to take a pay cut. The state opted mostly for the latter.</p> <p>"It's a difficult moment for North Carolina," said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid. The cut in the budget is "absolutely the opposite direction of where we really want to go, need to go, have been headed as a state."</p>
<p>For Anita Case, who leads a small group of health clinics in North Carolina, the cuts make it harder to take care of the "most vulnerable in our community."</p> <p>Western North Carolina Community Health Services' three clinics serve about 15,000 patients in and around Asheville, including many non-English-speaking tourism workers. Case said she will look at staffing, services, and contracts to find places to trim.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Hospitals at risk of closure in Idaho</h3> <p>Idaho has about 350,000 people enrolled in Medicaid. This month, state leaders there responded to an $80 million state budget shortfall by cutting Medicaid pay rates 4% across the board.</p>
<p>The broad cuts have raised backlash from nursing home operators and patient advocacy groups. Leaders of one nursing home company wrote in a recent op-ed in the Idaho Statesman newspaper that 75 to 100% of the funding at their facilities comes from Medicaid and the cuts will force them to "to reduce staff or accept fewer residents."</p> <p>Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter said the state faced tough choices. It forecasted 19% growth in Medicaid spending this year.</p> <p>The Idaho Hospital Association's Toni Lawson said the financial strain will be greatest at about two dozen small hospitals — ones with 25 or fewer beds — that dot the state. Lawson, the organization's chief advocacy officer, said one hospital leader reported they had less than two days of cash on hand to make payroll. Others reported 30 days of cash or less, she said.</p> <p>"Hopefully, none of them will close," Lawson said, adding that she expects labor and delivery and behavioral health units, which often lose money, to be the first to go because of this latest state reduction in payments. Several hospitals in mostly rural areas of the state closed their labor and delivery units last year, she said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A big part of state budgets</h3> <p>Nationwide, Medicaid makes up an average of 19% of a state's general fund spending, second only to K-12 spending, said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies for the National Association of State Budget Officers.</p> <p>States generally had strong revenue growth in 2021 and 2022 because of economic growth, which included federal aid to stimulate the economy. Revenue growth has since slowed, and some states have cut income and property taxes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, spending on Medicaid, housing, education, and disaster response has increased, Sigritz said.</p> <p>In North Carolina, Fabrello has been unable to work outside of caring for her son. Her savings are almost exhausted, Fabrello said, and she was on the brink of financial ruin until the state began allowing parents to be compensated for caregiving duties. She has received that income for about a year, she said. Without it, she worried about losing her home.</p>
<p>Now, with the state reductions, she faces a salary cut.</p>
<p>"As parents, we are indispensable lifelines to our children, and we are struggling to fight for our own survival on top of it," Fabrello said.</p> <p><em>KFF Health News</em><em> is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at</em><em> KFF</em><em> — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">At least 5 dead in large-scale nighttime Russian strike on Ukraine</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>At least five civilians died after Russia launched drones, missiles and guided aerial bombs at Ukraine overnight into Sunday, in a major nighttime attack that officials there said targeted civilian infrastructure.</p> <p>Moscow sent over 50 ballistic missiles and around 500 drones into nine regions across Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday morning.</p> <p>Four people, including a 15-year-old, died in a combined drone and missile strike on Lviv, according to regional officials and Ukraine's emergency service. The historic western city is often seen as a haven from the fighting and destruction further east. At least six more people sustained injuries, according to a statement by Ukraine's police force.</p>
<p>The strike left two districts without power and public transport suspended for a few hours early Sunday, mayor Andriy Sadovyi reported. He added that a business complex on the outskirts of Lviv was on fire following the strike, describing it as a civilian facility not linked to Ukraine's war effort.</p> <p>One person was also injured in the Ivano-Frankivsk region south of Lviv, according to local Gov. Svitlana Onyshchuk.</p>
<p>In the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, a nighttime aerial assault killed a civilian woman and wounded nine other people including a 16-year-old girl, regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov reported. He said Russia attacked with drones and guided aerial bombs.</p> <p>Fedorov said the strike destroyed residential buildings and left some 73,000 households in Zaporizhzhia and surrounding areas without power.</p>
<p>Separately, six people including a child were injured in Sloviansk, a key city in the eastern Donetsk region that remains under Ukrainian control, after a Russian guided aerial bomb slammed into an apartment block, regional prosecutors reported on Sunday. They said Russian airstrikes on Saturday evening damaged over two dozen residential buildings in Sloviansk, as well as cars, shops and a cafe.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy on Sunday reiterated his call on Kyiv's Western partners to send additional air defenses to combat Russia's "aerial terror."</p> <p>"Today, the Russians again targeted our infrastructure, everything that ensures people can live a normal life. We need more protection, a rapid implementation of all defense agreements, especially on air defense, to make this aerial terror pointless," he said in a Telegram post.</p> <p>Ukraine has for months conducted its own long-range strikes on Russia, many of which have targeted Moscow's oil infrastructure and contributed to persistent fuel shortages.</p>
<p>For its part, the Kremlin has ramped up attacks on Ukraine's power grid ahead of winter, as in previous years since the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Kyiv calls it an attempt to weaponize the cold by denying civilians heat, light and running water.</p> <p>Moscow has also stepped up airstrikes on Ukraine's railway network, which is essential for military transport, hitting it almost every day over the past two months. Russian drones on Saturday struck a railway station in the northern city of Shostka, killing one and wounding dozens.</p>

<div class="article-title">With makeshift jump ropes and hide and seek, kids play to cope with crisis</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>In a refugee camp in Bangladesh, children jump rope with chains of rubber bands. In wartime Gaza, kids fly kites made from discarded parachutes. And in Ukraine, youngsters tussle in make-believe war, imitating soldiers as the real conflict rages on.</p> <p>These are some of the ways that children continue to create, imagine and seek joy even in the harshest circumstances. For them, play is not a simple pastime but a lifeline. Child psychologists say it helps them manage stress, express their emotions and regain a sense of control and normalcy when there's little safety and stability.</p>
<p>"It helped remove our sadness," says 12-year-old Asma Bibi, who lives in a Rohingya refugee settlement in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. She spoke in Rohingya and her interview was translated.</p> <p>Bibi says her father and brother were both killed in their home country of Myanmar, where they were targets of ethnic cleansing. If it wasn't for the small, colorful playroom at her camp, set up by BRAC, an international group focused on poverty, she says her mind "wouldn't feel good."</p> <p>Throughout history, play has offered much-needed reprieve and comfort to children living through crisis. The popular game Candy Land was designed in the 1940s at a polio ward in San Diego to keep children entertained during their recovery. About a decade ago, amid Syria's civil war, volunteers built a small, underground amusement park so little ones could play, shielded from bombing and shelling. NPR has also previously reported about how children in Nigeria who lost a parent at the hands of Boko Haram militants found moments of joy through play. </p>
<p>Today, as the world faces over 60 conflicts — the highest number since the end of World War II — play remains as important as ever.</p> <p>"Children are resilient and they are trying really hard to be resilient and play should be seen as a form of resiliency," says Lauren Potthoff,  a pediatric psychologist at Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, who has worked  with Ukrainian psychologists and children amid the war with Russia.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>Healing and belonging</strong></h3> <p>When Rohingya children began arriving at the refugee camps in Cox's Bazar in 2017, signs of trauma were evident in how they played, according to Erum Mariam, who leads BRAC's Institute of Educational Development in Bangladesh.</p> <p>One child — she recalled — molded a clay house surrounded by many gates. When asked why, the child replied, "so that those who kind of torture us, they cannot enter," Mariam says.</p> <p>More than one million Rohingya refugees who fled persecution from the Myanmar military now live in camps in Cox's Bazar — and over half of them are under 18, according to UNICEF.</p>
<p>BRAC has set up over 300 play labs across the camps. Parents also deeply wanted to contribute to the effort to enable their kids to play, Mariam says, creating jump ropes by tying rubber bands together and crafting toy blocks from pieces of bamboo — all to help their children find moments of joy after everything they had endured.</p> <p>There has been one favorite activity above all: Kabbiya, a traditional Rohingya call-and-response game. It goes like this: A child will yell out a rhyme and perform a simple movement, like swaying side to side. Immediately after, the rest of the group will join in, echoing the chant and mimicking the caller's action.</p> <p>Mariam believes part of the game's draw is that parents, grandparents and other community members can all participate. " When the play is rooted in the culture, it gives children a sense of belongingness," she says.</p> <p>When Mariam first met children at the play labs, she says many were silent and withdrawn. When they drew, they depicted guns or scenes of violence. But over time, through play, she saw a different side emerge.</p> <p>"Now, if you go into a humanitarian play lab, you'll find children laughing, giggling," she says. "Those images that they drew about the guns are not there."</p>
<p>Ayub Khan, 12, says he was haunted by the violence in Myanmar when he arrived at the camps several years ago. When he felt sad, he would run to BRAC's playroom, where he would play marbles or read poems. If it wasn't for the play lab, he said would've spent most days at home. Khan's interview was translated from Rohingya.</p> <p>"I wouldn't have felt good," he says. "I wouldn't have felt peace in my mind."</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>How war comes into play</strong></h3> <p>In Ukraine, where the war with Russia has raged for over three years, some children have turned conflict into play — creating a version of hide-and-seek where they pretend to be Russian and Ukrainian soldiers.</p> <p>The game goes beyond simply chasing one another. Rather, the goal is to pretend to kill or torture members of the opposing side, according to Yaroslava Mozghova, head of programs for War Child Alliance in Ukraine. The international organization provides mental health support, as well as safe spaces for children living in conflict to learn and play.</p>
<p>" I believe that this aspect of Ukrainians and Russians looking for each other, that's what we created in 2022," she says.</p> <p>Mozghova adds that she has also seen some children act-out being guards at a checkpoint — pretending to demand documents and deciding who can pass through.</p> <p>While not all children are drawn to war-themed activities, Mozghova says she is not surprised by those who are, adding that it's natural for children to want to mirror their surroundings.</p> <p>"Checkpoints or soldiers, that's a part of the world they live in," she says. "So they imitate this world."</p> <p>Ruot Gach, a project officer at War Child Alliance, says he has also seen conflict shape the way children play at a refugee transit center in northern South Sudan. Aside from games like volleyball and dominoes, Gach says some children stage fake ambushes on one another while pretending to be government forces or rebel fighters.</p>
<p>According to Gach, this kind of play has existed for years and its a reflection of the five-year civil war that lasted in South Sudan until 2018 and the ongoing war in Sudan.</p>
<p>"This kind of experience that they came through from Sudan is still reflecting in their mind," he said.</p> <p>It's not unusual to see children imitate soldiers or war if they have been exposed to violence, according to pediatric psychologist Potthoff. She adds that it's one way children try to "regain a sense of mastery" or control over difficult circumstances.</p> <p>"That doesn't mean that they like violence," she says. "It means that they're trying to understand it. They're trying to process it."</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Time to play</strong></h3> <p>In Gaza, children are hungry, exhausted and mourning the deaths of family and friends, but their desire to play is still strong, says Georgia Tacey, a humanitarian expert on Save the Children's Gaza response team, who has traveled to Gaza multiple times over the past 18 months.</p> <p>On the streets, she says she has seen young boys and girls make do with whatever they have at hand — forming soccer balls from shredded plastic sheeting and kites out of aid parachutes, and using firewood for the classic tower-building game Jenga.</p> <p>Save the Children's team sets up games and crafts for children. Tacey says children would often dash to be on time for one of the scheduled play sessions.</p>
<p>"They're so desperate for that connection and for the distraction," she says.</p> <p>Those who were unable to participate because space was limited would still linger outside.</p> <p>" Children will just line up down the street just to listen to other children singing in that tent," she says.</p> <p>Opportunities to play, no matter how brief, give children in Gaza reprieve from the responsibilities they are forced to take on because of the conflict, says Tacey — from caring for younger siblings to needing to be constantly informed by the news.</p>
<p>" I think it just shows that, you know, children are children wherever you go," she says.</p>

<p>SAN ANDRÉS, Colombia — Nearly 50 years after she first put on a wetsuit, Elvira Alvarado still remembers coming upon a coral reef off Colombia's Caribbean coast.</p> <p>"Everything was alive. And it was green and bright orange. And there were fishes. And there were huge things. And they were corals. It was astonishing," she says. "Can you imagine paradise? It's paradise."</p> <p>At 70, Colombian marine biologist Elvira Alvarado is still diving, researching and training a new generation of scientists. Her mission: rescuing Colombia's endangered coral reefs by reproducing coral through in-vitro fertilization. Her lifelong dedication to these marine invertebrates has earned her the nickname: "the mother of Colombian corals."</p>
<p>Coral are vital ecosystems that provide food, shelter and breeding grounds for some 4,000 fish species. They protect shorelines from erosion. They even support tourism by attracting snorkelers and divers.</p> <p>However, diseases, pollution and rising ocean temperatures are taking a huge toll. Since the 1970s, more than half of all the coral in the Caribbean have died.</p> <p>"I saw them dying. I saw them turning white," says Alvarado from the Colombian island of San Andrés in the Caribbean Sea, where many of the once exotic, garden-like coral reefs are now barren.</p>
<p>Juliana Vanegas, a marine biologist who works with Alvarado, explains what happens.</p> <p>"The coral are still alive, but when they are bleached and are not feeding, they start to get weaker and weaker," she says. "And if that lasts for enough time the coral die, basically of starvation."</p> <p>In addition, coral weakened by disease or overheated water have a much harder time reproducing. So, here on San Andrés, Alvarado and her team of about a dozen divers, decked out in scuba gear, are lending a hand through in-vitro fertilization, or IVF.</p> <p>The technique was pioneered by Australian scientist Peter Harrison. It involves collecting coral eggs and sperm, fertilizing them in a laboratory, then transplanting them to existing reefs. Alvarado has become Colombia's most energetic proponent of the technique.</p>
<p>"We can't stop what is happening," she says, referring to climate change and highly lethal threats like Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease, which was first reported in 2014 and has spread throughout the Caribbean. "But we can try to replace coral that's dying."</p>
<p>Alvarado was first drawn to the ocean by television. As a young girl living in the U.S. she was fascinated by programs like <em>Sea Hunt</em> and <em>Flipper</em>, about a bottlenose dolphin that outsmarts most of the humans on the show.</p> <p>She moved back in Colombia in the 1960s to became one of the country's first female marine biologists to focus on coral reef restoration. Along the way she got to meet Jacques Cousteau, the world's most famous oceanographer who visited her university.</p> <p>"We sat down, and he was talking to me. It was a dream," she says.</p>
<p>Alvarado was a natural underwater. She learned to free dive — without air tanks — to a depth of 72 feet. She initially did cancer research involving sharks. However, as coral began dying off, she focused on reef restoration by growing new coral.</p> <p>Timing is everything. Coral spawn just once a year, about a week after the full moon. That gives Alvarado's team here on San Andrés just a tiny window of opportunity to dive down and collect coral eggs and sperm.</p> <p>Alvarado moves gracefully underwater. Some 30 feet down, she and her team place nets with collection tubes around selected coral. Then, after dark on a second dive, they check the collection tubes. Last night, they came up empty. But tonight's a different story.</p> <p>"They've spawned," yells an ecstatic Alvarado, who then rushes off to a makeshift laboratory.</p> <p>There, she and the team mix together eggs and sperm and place them in water-filled plastic tubs. Under a microscope, they appear creamy white in the shape of raspberries. Soon, the coral hatchlings will be placed in seaside nurseries for 6 to 12 months then taken back to the reefs.</p> <p>And because the team has gathered genetic material from coral that appear more resistant to heat and stress, their efforts are designed to reproduce hardier varieties. The trick, says Alvarado, is to regenerate coral faster than they die. But she's also realistic.</p>
<p>While coral reefs will not be as diverse as they were when she first started diving in the 1970s, she says: "We will have reefs that are resistant to the warming conditions."</p>
<p>She's also proud to have mentored scores of young marine biologists — mostly women — who all seem to adore her.</p> <p>"She's a very inspiring woman," says María Fernanda Maya who heads the Blue Indigo Foundation that works to restore reefs. "She's the mother of coral in Colombia."</p> <p>That's why, when Alvarado finally does hang up her swim fins, her legacy will live on.</p> <p>"When I started this, we were just three people — two students and me. And look what we've got now," Alvarado says. "This will continue even after I'm dead. That's the good thing."</p>
