<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>50 Cent wasted no time mocking Sean "Diddy" Combs after the music mogul was sentenced Friday to 50 months in prison on federal prostitution charges.</p><p>The rapper, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, posted on X not long after Diddy's sentence was revealed, offering to take his spot at an upcoming speaking engagement.Â </p><p>"Hey to whoever was booking Diddy for speaking engagement. I heard he wonâ€™t be able to make it, ðŸ¤· Iâ€™m available! ðŸ˜†" 50 Cent wrote, including a link to his website, G-Unit Brands.</p><p>He was likely referencing speaking engagements that Diddy had booked for next week in Miami, which the prosecution revealed during the sentencing hearing.</p><p>The two artists are longtime rivals â€“ their feud goes back decades after 50 Cent accused Diddy of knowing who murdered rapper Notorious B.I.G. on his 2006 diss track "The Bomb."</p><p>On Thursday, the eve of the sentencing, 50 Cent posted a "letter" he wrote to Judge Arun Subramanian, who issued the ruling in Diddy's case.</p><p>"I have had an ongoing dispute with Puffy (one of Diddy's nicknames) for over 20 years. He is very dangerous. Multiple times I have feared for my life," the letter reads.</p><p>50 Cent then goes on to explain why he thinks Diddy should remain in jail and ends the letter with a reference to all the baby oil found when federal authorities raided Diddy's properties last year.</p><p>A jury found Diddy guilty on both counts of transportation to engage in prostitution during his sex trafficking and racketeering trial in July 2025. He was found not guilty of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.</p><p>In addition to the 50-month sentence, Diddy will have five years of supervised release and pay a $500,000 fine.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>CNN political commentator Van Jones shared his "concern" for Democrats on "Real Time" Friday as the government shutdown drags into the weekend.Â </p><p>"I think you can always trust our party to do the wrong thing at the wrong time for the right reason," Jones charged.Â </p><p>The Senate again failed to reopen the government Friday on a largely party line, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and most Senate Democrats refusing to budge on their fight over Obamacare.</p><p>They argue that people who use Obamacare will see their health-care premiums skyrocket if Congress doesnâ€™t immediately negotiate a bipartisan continuing resolution (CR) extending Obamacare tax credits that expire at the end of the year.</p><p>The CNN pundit acknowledged he might "piss off" some of his Democratic friends before explaining what he sees as the partyâ€™s political disadvantage in forcing a shutdown.</p><p>"So now people are going to be mad about the post office and a hundred other things that Republicans can then blame on us," the commentator lamented.</p><p>While Jones objected to healthcare premiums going "through the roof" in October, he addressed what he sees as the less harmful option.Â </p><p>"I get it, the base is upsetâ€¦â€™Please do something, do anything,â€™ but the something probably shouldnâ€™t be throwing a bunch of people out of work in the federal government and crushing American governmentâ€™s ability to function right before the pain was about to start," he argued. "So thatâ€™s my concern." Â </p><p>Jones appeared to share "Real Time" host Bill Maherâ€™s view that the shutdown is a form of "leverage" for Democrats.Â </p><p>However, he stressed that it should be used "at the right time," calling the shutdown just one more "piece of garbage" thrown at Americans.</p><p>The commentator went on to call out Schumerâ€™s apparent change of heart about the situation.Â </p><p>"The weird thing is, I talked to Chuck Schumer about this like three months ago, and he was kicking me in the butt because I had been tough on him for not allowing the government to shut down," Jones recalled. "And he convinced me that shutting the government down is stupid. Then I turn on the TV and he says, â€˜Weâ€™re now shutting the government down.â€™"Â </p><p>While Jones called the shutdownâ€™s timing "not that great," he concluded, "Maybe itâ€™ll work."</p><p>Both political parties have yet to reach a deal on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Republicans, like Senate Majority Leader John Thune, accuse Democrats of holding Americans â€“ and their government â€“ "hostage."</p><p>"This is about doing what's in the best interest of the American people," Thune said Friday. "And what's in the best interest of the American people is keeping the government open and operating so it can continue to work on their behalf."Â </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Japan poised for first female prime minister after ruling party elects Sanae Takaichi as new leader</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Japan is on track to get its first female prime minister after the leading conservative party elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader.Â </p><p>Takaichi, the former economic security minister of Japan, beat Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of popular former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, in a runoff in an intraparty vote on Saturday by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.</p><p>Takaichi is replacing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba as the party looks to regain public support and stay in power.Â </p><p>Despite suffering major election losses, the Liberal Democratic Party remains by far the largest in the lower house and determines Japanâ€™s leader because opposition groups are highly splintered.</p><p>In the first round of voting, Takaichi finished first with 183 votes and Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi placed second with 164. Because neither candidate reached a majority in the first round, the winner was determined in an immediate two-way runoff.Â </p><p>The LDP, whose consecutive losses in parliamentary elections in the past year have left it in the minority in both houses, sought a leader who can quickly address challenges both domestic and international, while seeking cooperation from key opposition groups to implement its policies.</p><p>Takaichi, a hard-line conservative whoâ€™s cited former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her hero, has called for strengthening Japanâ€™s military, and taking a tougher stance against China and North Korea. She also opposes same-sex marriage and retains ties to nationalist groups.Â </p><p>Takaichi also faces a possible summit with President Donald Trump, who could demand that Japan increase its defense spending. A meeting is reportedly being planned for late October. Trump will travel to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea starting Oct. 31.</p><p>The LDP also needs help from the opposition, which it has long neglected. The party will likely look to expand its coalition with the moderate centrist Komeito with at least one of the key opposition parties, which are more centrist.</p><p>A parliamentary vote is expected in mid-October.

<div class="article-title">North Carolina governor signs 'Iryna's Law' after Ukrainian refugee's brutal train murder</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein on Friday signed "Iryna's Law," which increases checks on criminals getting out on bail and prohibits cashless bail for some violent crimes and most repeat offenders following the stabbing death of a Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte light-rail train in August.Â </p><p>Stein, a Democrat, has said he doesnâ€™t like every part of the bill that was passed by the Republican-controlled state Legislature, which also looks to restart executions in North Carolina, but he signed it because it "alerts the judiciary to take a special look at people who may pose unusual risks of violence before determining their bail. Thatâ€™s a good thing."</p><p>Iryna Zarutska, 23, was killed on Aug. 22, and Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., who had been arrested more than a dozen times, including an armed robbery charge for which he served five years in prison before the fatal train stabbing, has been charged with first-degree murder.</p><p>He was most recently released in January on a misdemeanor charge.</p><p>"Finally, we are getting dangerous criminals off our streets so we can make sure no one else suffers the heartbreak that Iryna Zarutskaâ€™s family endured," Charlotte-area Republican state Rep. Tricia Cotham, who was involved with the legislation, said in a news release.Â </p><p>Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have blamed Zarutskaâ€™s death on Democrats, accusing them of being soft on crime.Â </p><p>"The blood of this innocent woman can literally be seen dripping from the killerâ€™s knife, and now her blood is on the hands of the Democrats who refuse to put bad people in jail, including Former Disgraced Governor and â€˜Wannabe Senatorâ€™ Roy Cooper,"Â Trump wrote on Truth Social after the attack.Â </p><p>The violent stabbing sparked outrage, especially after security video showing the attack was released.Â </p><p>"We can and must do more to keep people safe," Stein said in a video posted to social media on Friday. "When I review public safety legislation that comes to my desk, I use one simple test: Does it make people safer?"Â </p><p>He said that "Iryna's Law" alerts the judiciary to take a special look at who could warrant an "unusual" risk for violence before determining their bail.Â </p><p>"Thatâ€™s a good thing and why I have signed it into law."Â </p><p>But, he said he had criticisms of the law, including that it focuses more on a defendantâ€™s ability to post bail rather than the threat they pose, and "more alarming," he added that a last-minute amendment to the bill that "aims to bring about execution by firing squad in North Carolina. Itâ€™s barbaric."</p><p>The last execution in North Carolina was in 2006.Â </p><p>He stressed that he wouldnâ€™t allow firing squads while heâ€™s governor. The bill doesn't specifically mention firing squads.Â </p><p>He said he was also troubled by the billâ€™s "lack of ambition or vision. It simply does not do enough to keep you safe."Â </p><p>The governor said he wanted the legislature to pass his comprehensive bill that would add more police officers on the streets, violence prevention measures like keeping kids out of gangs, and would attempt to make sure that people who are violent or mentally ill donâ€™t have access to guns via background checks.Â </p><p>"Irynaâ€™s Law" prohibits cashless bail for some violent crimes and for most repeat offenders; it limits the discretion magistrates and judges have in making pretrial release decisions; allows for the state chief justice to suspend magistrates and requires more defendants to undergo mental health evaluations.Â </p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">California using back door to get federal funds for illegal immigrant healthcare, GOP says; Dems say nonsense</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Democrats want to remove a provision of Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA) before reopening the government, but Republicans argue the line item they want removed is allowing California to use a "loophole" to draw down funds from the federal government to help pay for the state's ballooning cost of healthcare for illegal immigrants.</p><p>The White House released a memo on Wednesday during the first day of the government shutdown fight indicating Democrats want to repeal Trump reforms in his "big, beautiful bill" that aimed to close this alleged backdoor tactic. However, California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office and left-leaning health policy experts insist claimsthat California is using this tactic are not true.</p><p>"When Democrats say, as they keep saying, that there is no federal money or any taxpayer money going for illegal immigrant healthcare because it's illegal and barred by federal law, it's simply not true," said Steve Hilton, a former Fox News host now running to replace Newsom as governor of California.Â </p><p>Hilton claimed that California has been using a complex Medicaid provision known as a "provider tax" to obtain matching federal dollars, which then gets pooled into the money used by the state to pay for its healthcare offered to undocumented immigrants.</p><p>"If [federal dollars] are funding non-emergency healthcare for ineligible immigrants, the sole cause is provider taxes," Michael Cannon, a health policy expert at the CATO Institute told Fox News Digital.Â </p><p>Cannon, however, suggested Republicans shot themselves in the foot by choosing only to limit the scope of eligibility around provider tax funds in the OBBBA, saying no more could go to states providing illegal immigrants healthcare, and they should have just quashed them altogether.Â </p><p>"What they did was that Republicans preserved the ability of states to use provider taxes to fund healthcare for undocumented immigrants using Medicaid," he argued.</p><p>However, Newsom's office insisted to the Los Angeles Times that the claim California is utilizing a provider tax "loophole" to fund illegal immigrant healthcare is simply not true. It is effectively impossible to make a determination one way or the other because states do not keep records on how provider tax funds from the federal government are spent.Â </p><p>"This is false â€” CA does not do this," Gardon said in a one-line email to the LA Times. Newsom's office did not reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment in time for publication.</p><p>Other healthcare policy experts agree as well that this is not happening.</p><p>"The so-called California loopholereferences a provision in the law that ends a waiver of the uniformity requirements for provider taxes. This provision has nothing to do with using federal funds to pay for care for undocumented immigrants," Jennifer Tolbert, a healthcare expert at the nonprofit healthcare research organization KFF.Â </p><p>"But the White House makes the claim that California uses the money they get from the provider tax to pay for care for undocumented immigrants."Â </p><p>Chris Pope, a health policy expert from the Manhattan Institute, argues California is also using emergency care claims to draw down even more funds to help pay for its ballooning cost of being the first state in the nation to offer comprehensive healthcare coverage for anyone regardless of their immigration status.Â </p><p>Federal law does not permit federal funds to be used for non-emergency medical care for illegal immigrants, but it does not prohibit them from being used for emergency care for these folks. Â </p><p>"The enormous and open-ended discretion Medicaid gives states to claim federal funding makes it hard for the feds to ensure that the programâ€™s expenditures are reserved for its intended purposes," Pope wrote in an Op-Ed for the New York Post Friday. "Until that changes, the Democratic claim that federal money isnâ€™t being used on illegal immigrants is simply not true."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud has played fewer than three full seasons in the NFL.</p><p>Stroud celebrated his 24th birthday on Friday, and he already seems to be experiencing the ill effects of playing in the league. On Thursday, Stroud was asked about methods he has incorporated into his daily regimen that help him stay in optimal physical condition.</p><p>Stroud then spoke about his diet and staying consistent with exercise. But he raised some eyebrows when he compared his current athletic ability to his days as a high school football star.</p><p>The 2023 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year informed reporters he feels like he is "getting old."</p><p>While Stroud noted he has made strides in his diet and stretching, he also believes he has lost a step.Â </p><p>"Where I think the explosiveness comes from is being better on my diet, being better with stretching. I feel like Iâ€™m getting old. Iâ€™m not as quick as I used to be," Stroud said as he smiled. "I was watching my high school stuff a couple days ago. I was like 180 (pounds), and I was rolling, but not no more. But, yeah, I try to just be better with that stuff so I can run fast."</p><p>Stroud, the second overall selection in the 2022 NFL Draft, is listed at 220 pounds, a gain of 40 pounds from his high school weight.</p><p>While Stroud's drop in athleticism is debatable, the young signal-callerâ€™s production has dipped since his standout rookie season.</p><p>Through four games this season, Stroud has thrown four touchdowns and three interceptions. He finished 2024 with 3,727 passing yards, 20 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.</p><p>Stroudâ€™s rookie season ended with 4,108 passing yards, 23 touchdowns and five interceptions.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump said Friday that anyone who burns the American flag "will be immediately arrested" and face a one-year prison term, citing his Aug. 25 executive order on flag desecration.</p><p>"To ICE, Border Patrol, Law Enforcement, and all U.S. Military: As per my August 25, 2025 Executive Order, please be advised that, from this point forward, anybody burning the American Flag will be subject to one year in prison," Trump posted on Truth Social Friday evening."You will be immediately arrested. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"</p><p>The executive order itself stopped short of creating new penalties, directing the Justice Department to prioritize cases under existing laws "to the maximum extent permitted by the Constitution."</p><p>Supreme Court rulings in Texas v. Johnson (1989) and United States v. Eichman (1990) held that flag burning is protected speech. Trumpâ€™s statement goes further, setting up potential legal battles if arrests are pursued.</p><p>Trump has long pushed to punish flag desecration, and the latest post sharpens his law-and-order message as the government shutdown continues."President Trump will not allow the American Flag, a special symbol of our countryâ€™s greatness, to be used as a tool to incite violence and riots that jeopardize the safety of everyday Americans," White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital. "President Trump will always protect the First Amendment, while simultaneously implementing commonsense, tough-on-crime policies to prevent violence and chaos."</p><p>The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Justice Department is launching an investigation into the Portland Police Bureau's "questionable" practices amid accusations by the Trump administration that the force has acted with bias during weekslong anti-ICE protests.</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, announced the probe Friday, citing orders from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p><p>"We will not leave the people of Portland at the whims of criminals and woke cops. Govern yourselves accordingly!" she wrote on X.</p><p>In a letter dated Friday to Portland City Attorney Robert Taylor and Police Chief Bob Day, Dhillon cited concerns about the police response to several incidents, including the arrest of a conservative journalist and police actions allegedly limiting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) use of its Portland facility.</p><p>Dhillon's office requested unredacted incident reports related to the use of force, arrests and other actions and communications regarding directions given to police officers responding to protests at ICE facilities within the past 30 days.</p><p>Dhillon requested that her office be provided the materials no later than Oct. 10.</p><p>The city received the inquiry while its lawyers were in court attempting to stop the deployment of National Guard troops to help protect federal property.</p><p>"We are still reviewing this inquiry and do not have a comment at this time on specific requests lodged by the federal government," the city said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. "What we can say is this: Mayor Wilson has full faith in the Portland Police Bureauâ€™s commitment to protecting public safety, upholding the rights of all individuals to lawfully assemble and impartially enforcing the law."</p><p>Portland has seen nightly protests over the Trump administration's immigration enforcement actions.

She said the Department of Justice spoke with Sortor Friday morning and "will be launching a full investigation into his arrest."</p><p>"This incident is part of a troubling trend in Portland, where left-wing mobs believe they get to decide who can visit and live in their city.

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The New York Jets have responded to allegations made by former employee Elaine Chen.</p><p>Chen filed a lawsuit claiming she was fired in response to her role in an investigation of allegations of sexual misconduct against team president Hymie Elhai. Chen alleges the Jets retaliated against her and her husband after complaints were made against Elhai.Â </p><p>The Jets have provided a statement to Fox News Digital calling the allegations "categorically false," adding the organization is filing legal claims against Chen and her husband.Â </p><p>"The recent allegations against the organization and Mr. Elhai are categorically false. We are filing legal claims, including defamation and libel against Ms. Chen; her husband, Larry Fitzpatrick; and other parties involved," the statement said.Â </p><p>"The allegations made against Mr. Elhai were taken seriously and investigated thoroughly in accordance with organization policy and involved third party investigative measures.Â </p><p>"That investigation revealed the truth, with a disturbing twist: The allegations of harassment were not only baseless, but the email at the center of the allegations was part of a deliberate and unlawful conspiracy of then-current and former Jets employees, including Ms. Chen and her husband, Mr. Fitzpatrick."</p><p>Chen's lawsuit did not identify her husband by name.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Radio host Stephen A. Smith called out Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, on his show, arguing she focused too much on anti-Trump political theater instead of serving her voters.</p><p>Smith argued that due to decades of policy and a secure hold on Black voters, "you have a Democratic Party that knew they were getting our vote, would engage in demagoguery, scare the living hell out of us about what existed on the right and, as a result, they'd get our vote. And all they had to do to get it was to give us lip service about negative stuff about the other side."</p><p>Smith went on to suggest that Black voters, to their detriment, have allowed themselves to be placated by performative politics rather than concrete solutions.</p><p>"As I religiously stated throughout the years, when White folks catch a cold, Black folks catch pneumonia. It's always worse for us. Pick any historical data you want to point to. It is always worse for us," Smith said.</p><p>"And I believe the biggest reason in this day and age ainâ€™t even about racism to the degree it once was," he argued. "What it's really about is us not strategizing, playing checkers instead of chess, letting our emotions instead of facts lead the way and letting that guide us to express ourselves in ways that serve to alienate the very people who can help us."</p><p>Smith argued that while he respects intelligent women, it is actual solutions and compromise with opposition that yields solutions, not political theater.</p><p>"But how Jasmine Crockett chooses to express herself, I'm like, â€˜Is that gonna help your district in Texas?â€™ Aren't you there to find a way to get stuff done, as opposed to just being an impediment to what Trump wants? How much work goes into that?" Smith said.</p><p>He then mocked Crockettâ€™s perceived approach.</p><p>"â€™I'm just going to go off about Trump, cuss him out every chance I get, say the most derogatory, incendiary things imaginable and that's my day's work,'" Smith said.</p><p>"That ain't work!</p><p>"Work," Smith argued, "is saying, â€˜That's the man in power. I know what his agenda is. I'm not exactly in a position to stop him since the Republicans have the Senate and the House, but maybe if I'm willing to work with this man, I might get something out of it for my constituency.â€™</p><p>"Because, like Joe Manchin said, he's there to represent, or was there for 15 years to represent the people of West Virginia. She's supposed to be there to represent the people of Texas. I don't know. Maybe that just sounds ignorant because it's so simple, but it ain't that damn complicated," Smith concluded.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Paramore singer Hayley Williams confirmed that her "racist country singer" lyric on her new album is about Morgan Wallen.</p><p>On The New York Times podcast, Williams discussed her album, "Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party," which has a lyric that calls out a specific country music star.</p><p>The lyric is, "I'll be the biggest star at this racist country singerâ€™s bar."</p><p>When asked about who the lyric was about on the podcast, Williams admitted it "could be a couple" of musicians, but she had Wallen in mind when writing the song.</p><p>"I'm always talking about Morgan Wallen. I don't give a s---. Find me at Whole Foods b----. I don't care. I just don't care," the Paramore frontwoman said.</p><p>She noted on the podcast that she's "never not ready to scream at the top of my lungs about racial issues."</p><p>"I don't know why that became the thing that gets me most angry. I think because itâ€™s so intersectional that it overlaps with everything from climate change to LGBTQIA issues," Williams said.</p><p>Wallen has not publicly addressed Williams's remarks. Fox News Digital reached out to the country star for comment.</p><p>In February 2021, Wallen was caught on camera using the N-word while speaking with friends in a driveway in Tennessee.Â </p><p>A few months later, Wallen admitted during an interview with Michael Strahan on "Good Morning America" that he had been "partying all weekend" with some "longtime friends" before the slur was used.</p><p>"No, I don't think it just happened. I was around some of my friends and we just, we say dumb stuff together. In our minds, it's playful. It sounds ignorant, but that's really where it came from, and it's wrong.</p><p>"We were all clearly drunk, and I was asking his girlfriend to take care of him because he was drunk, and he was leaving. I didn't mean it in any derogatory manner at all," he said at the time.</p><p>Strahan pressed Wallen why he would feel it was an "appropriate" word to ever use, to which the country crooner admitted he was "just ignorant about it."</p><p>In April 2021, Wallen took to X and issued a handwritten apology to fans. He revealed he would be taking a break from performing that summer.</p><p>"I have felt a lot of love lately from so many people I haven't gotten to know yet," Wallen began, thanking his fans who stood beside him. "I know my corner hasn't been the most popular one to stand in recently, but many of you did anyway."</p><p>Wallen maintained that he had "made some mistakes" in 2020 and called it a "tough year," likely pointing to his public intoxication arrest in May and disorderly conduct chargesÂ in September 2020.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Virginia governorâ€™s race ad stirs â€˜Willie Hortonâ€™ echoes as early voting hits record pace</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> A new seven-figure ad in Virginiaâ€™s governorâ€™s race is drawing comparisons to the infamous Willie Horton spot of 1988 amid record early voting in the Old Dominion State.The ad, produced by the American Principles Project, attacks Democrat Abigail Spanberger over transgender policies and warns of the dangers of biological men in women's spaces. It comes as early voting tops 146,000 ballots in the first week, more than twice the pace of 2021, according to data from the Virginia Public Access Project.</p><p>The spot points to Richard Cox, a Tier III sex offender in Arlington County who has been charged multiple times with exposing himself in girlsâ€™ locker rooms. The ad says Spanbergerâ€™s record and her opposition to Gov. Glenn Youngkinâ€™s guidelines for transgender students would let it happen again. It accuses her of putting radical ideology ahead of safety for young girls."The case of sexual deviant Richard Cox preying upon young girls in Virginia is enraging to any decent person â€“ but not to Abigail Spanberger," Terry Schilling, President of the American Principles Project, told Fox News Digital. "She refuses to condemn Richard Cox at all."</p><p>"Sheâ€™s avoided answering any and all questions about it, and the answer is obvious because this situation is only possible because of Spanbergerâ€™s radical transgender policy agenda. Cox has been a repeat offender for over 30 years. He was allowed to enter womenâ€™s private spaces where little girls are vulnerable, and no one stopped him," Schilling added.Â "If Abigail Spanberger is elected governor of Virginia, she will repeal all protections for women in Virginia and put even more young girls in danger. The reason we are spending $1 million on this ad is because every Virginia voter should know that Abigail Spanberger will endanger their daughters."</p><p>APP has run similar ads in other battleground states, positioning itself as a defender of families and warning against policies it claims "confuse[s] young children about changing their gender." By airing the ad now, APP hopes to frame Spanberger as out of step with Virginia voters before Election Day.</p><p>The strategy echoes the famous Willie Horton ad of 1988 that linked Democrat Michael Dukakis to the convicted murderer who committed rape and assault while on weekend furlough from a Massachusetts prison. George H.W. Bush defeated Dukakis by seven points nationally, and the ad became a defining example of how the GOP can use crime to win races.</p><p>Spanberger has voted for the Equality Act in Congress and opposed Youngkinâ€™s guidelines, but local school boards control locker room access. Her campaign has tried to keep the focus on the economy and her own record in Washington.Â "Convicted sex offender Richard Cox is a predator who should be in jail â€” and thatâ€™s exactly where he is," a spokeperson for Spanberger's campaign told Fox News Digital. "Abigail is a parent of three daughters in Virginia public schools and a former federal law enforcement officer who went after child predators. Nothing is more important to her than the safety of Virginiaâ€™s kids.Â </p><p>"As Governor, Abigail will work with state and local law enforcement officers to keep Virginia kids safe and make sure sex offenders are prevented from preying on children and prosecuted for their crimes."</p><p>Cox remains in custody at the Arlington County jail on multiple pending charges, according to the Arlington County Sheriffâ€™s Office inmate database."Abigail Spanbergerâ€™s policies enabled Richard Cox to prey on women and girls. No amount of political damage control can erase that record," Schilling told Fox News Digital in response to the Spanberger campaign. "Spanberger is too dangerous to lead Virginia. As governor, Spanberger will repeal Gov. Youngkinâ€™s recent executive order barring males from female private spaces."Republicans argue that safety and cultural issues are resonating more deeply with parents across the state, particularly after Youngkin's win in 2021, which many linked to parental rights in education.</p><p>Polling shows Spanberger with a lead, but the numbers suggest a competitive race. A Washington Post Schar School poll taken in late September showed her at 55% to Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears at 43. With Republicans casting about half of the first weekâ€™s early ballots, the race is one of the most-watched in the nation.Â </p><p>More ads are expected as the campaign heats up and voters in Virginia send in record numbers of early ballots. The final weeks of the race will show whether the tough-on-crime playbook still rings true nearly four decades after Willie Horton. Early voting ends Nov. 1.Â The Earle-Sears campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>PROVO, Utah â€” Newly released surveillance video obtained by Fox News Digital shows Charlie Kirkâ€™s alleged assassin at a Utah gas station one day after the conservative influencer was gunned down while speaking at a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University.</p><p>Local authorities were initially called to a Maverik gas station in Cedar City, roughly 215 miles from where Kirk was shot, after Utah state officials alerted police that alleged shooter Tyler Robinson, 22, may have dumped evidence in a nearby trash can.Â </p><p>Officers subsequently responded to the tip, where they uncovered surveillance video of Robinson but confirmed that he did not throw anything in the gas stationâ€™s trash during his stop.Â </p><p>The video shows Robinsonâ€™s Dodge Challenger arriving at a Maverik gas station at around 7:15 a.m. on Sept. 11, in Cedar City, less than 24 hours into authoritiesâ€™ manhunt for the alleged assassin.Â </p><p>Robinson can be seen exiting his vehicle and paying for gas using a credit card before standing next to the car as he pumped fuel.Â </p><p>"Once the tank was full, he removed the nozzle, closed the gas cap, got back into his vehicle and left the gas station," the Cedar City Police Department said in an incident report. "At no time did Tyler approach or use any trash cans to dispose of items."Â </p><p>The video is one of the first glimpses into Robinsonâ€™s alleged getaway route from Orem to St. George as authorities raced to track down Kirkâ€™s accused killer.Â </p><p>Robinson was arrested later that day in St. George after he allegedly confessed or "implied" guilt to his parents, romantic partner and friends, according to court documents.Â </p><p>Robinson faces seven charges, including aggravated homicide, which carries the potential death penalty; felony discharge of a firearm; obstruction; and witness tampering. He has not yet entered a plea.</p><p>On Monday, Robinsonâ€™s attorney asked a judge for more time to review evidence before deciding if his legal team will request a preliminary hearing. Prosecutors have previously said they plan to seek the death penalty in Robinsonâ€™s case.Â </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Chloe Cole, a detransitioner who talks about transgender issues, accused Texas Christian University of viewpoint discrimination, claiming the institution made the process difficult for Turning Point USA to host an event she was scheduled to attend.Â </p><p>However, TCU flatly denies the notion that it engages in anti-Christian discrimination.</p><p>"They gave us a lot of hoops to jump through," Cole said. "TCU has, according to students and staff who I've spoken to, had a history of discriminating against their Christian and conservative students."</p><p>The event was planned for Oct. 7 with Cole being a featured speaker.Â </p><p>Cole claimed TCU tried to ignore Turning Point USA since the group has been working to establish a chapter on campus.Â </p><p>"We gave them several weeks' notice on doing this event. And they led us on for a while until they were expecting about, I think, 600 or more students or people in attendance at this event, and they provided us with only a room that would give us about 200 people, which isn't even half the attendance that we're expecting," she said.</p><p>The TCU spokesperson told Fox News Digital that "faith-based student organizations face no additional obstacles to hosting an event at TCU."</p><p>"We regularly welcome Christian and faith-based events, for example, the recent memorial for students and the community honoring the life of Charlie Kirk, hosted by TCUâ€™s TPUSA chapter on Sept. 18," the TCU spokesperson said.</p><p>"For the date of Oct. 7, no venue was available for an event open to the public for up to a thousand people, which has since been publicized 2,000.Â Alternatives and other options were explored and offered to accommodate the request for this date, and we remain open to finding a suitable venue on an available date," the spokesperson added.</p><p>The event will not happen due to logistical issues, the university told Fox News Digital. Once reports and rumors broke out about the event being moved to a different venue, the university faced backlash from conservatives and Texas officials. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Republican Rep. Chip Roy have said they will investigate the matter.</p><p>TCU disputed these claims, stating the event was never canceled because it was not booked in the first place.</p><p>"On September 18, TCU successfully hosted a TPUSA event to honor the life of Charlie Kirk, who had previously spoken on TCUâ€™s campus to students and the community. Separate from this event, an outside party, not affiliated with TCU, invited an external speaker to appear on our campus on Oct. 7," a TCU spokesperson told Fox News Digital.Â </p><p>"The student chapter of TPUSA then requested that TCU host the Oct. 7 event for 700 to 1,000 people. The requested space was already booked with another student event. We explored options and notified the group on Sept. 25 that a secure space was not available given the short notice, but we offered to find another date or space for the event."</p><p>Cole explained further that when she asked TCU to address it, the university told her "there would be no more discussion about the matter."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Virginia school board member compares Turning Point USA to KKK over transgender event</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Virginia school board member is under fire for comparing Turning Point USA to the KKK, a local outlet reported.</p><p>The TPUSA chapter at Western Albemarle High School scheduled an event, Two Genders, One Truth, on Wednesday. The eventâ€™s presentation was conducted by Family Foundation of Virginia President Victoria Cobb, who criticized transgender ideology.</p><p>According to The National Desk, reposted by KATV-ABC7, "The high school had originally canceled the event but later changed its mind, leading to Allison Spillman, an at-large representative of Albemarle County Public Schools, to make the wild comparison on Facebook."</p><p>"As a school board member and proud parent of a trans student I am beyond livid," Spillman wrote on Facebook.Â </p><p>"In my opinion this is not a matter of free speech, itâ€™s hate speech and has no place in our schools. If the KKK wanted a speaker during lunch would we allow that as well?"</p><p>Spillman accused the school district of violating its own policy by allowing the TPUSA chapter to host the event.</p><p>"If this makes you angry too then I encourage you to email our school board and the school admin and let them know," she continued.Â </p><p>"Shame on ACPS."</p><p>The post caught the attention of conservatives. High School Republican Federation of Virginia Chairman Kellen Habibelahy expressed concern about Spillman putting TPUSA members in danger.</p><p>"Albemarle County school board member Allison Spillman is comparing the Turning Point USA club there to the KKK and claiming they push hate speech," he wrote. "Talking like this could put the members in danger."</p><p>A spokesperson for Albemarle County School District told Fox News Digital that "with respect to At-Large Board Member Allison Spillmanâ€™s social media comments, I am sharing part of the response our School Board Chair, Dr. Kate Acuff, has given when addressing community concerns."</p><p>"Regarding the comments Ms. Spillman made, note that School Board members are eachÂ <i>elected</i>Â officials and any sanctions are felt at the ballot box," Acuff said.</p><p>"Although this year I serve as Chair, no Chair has the authority to control the speech of other School Board members or sanction them.Â Provided each School Board member makes it clear when making public comments that they do not speak for the entire SchoolÂ Board, each is responsible for their own comments. Only the School Board Chair and Vice Chair can speak on behalf of the entire School Board."</p><p>Spillman later posted a statement on Facebook following the backlash to her comments about TPUSA.</p><p>"As a member of the Albemarle County School Board and a parent of a transgender student, I want to be clear about a recent post I made regarding an upcoming Turning Point USA event at Western Albemarle High School," Spillman said.</p><p>"My concern is and always has been about protecting students and ensuring our schools remain safe, inclusive environments. The remarks I made were aimed at the content of the invited speaker's message, which I believe denies the identities of transgender students and contributes to a hostile environment for them," she added.</p><p>Spillman explained further that her intent was not to equate students involved in any club or organization to the Ku Klux Klan.</p><p>"In raising the example of the Ku Klux Klan, my intent was not to equate students involved in any club with that organization. Rather, I was drawing a parallel about the principle of setting boundaries for outside speakers who promote harmful or exclusionary ideas. We would not invite openly racist or antisemitic speakers into our schools; similarly, we must question whether it is appropriate to host a speaker whose message invalidates the existence of transgender students," she said.</p><p>"I aimed to raise the very salient question: what, if any, procedures are in place to vet any third parties proposed to be invited into our schools to interact directly with students? And if they result in such a speaker being invited to address our students in our schools, shouldnâ€™t they be reexamined?"</p><p>Kirk was assassinated Sept. 10 during an event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Hamas says it has agreed to parts of the Gaza peace proposal outlined by Trump</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Hamas said in a statement Friday it has agreed to parts of the ceasefire deal that President Trump <span class="link">outlined earlier this week</span>, including a demand to release all hostages â€” but the group suggested other portions of the deal should be subject to negotiation.Â </p><p>A U.S. official told CBS News the United States views Hamas' response as positive, though there are details that still need to be hammered out, such as the decommissioning of weapons, which may begin as soon as next week.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to the deal on Monday. Earlier Friday, Mr. Trump gave Hamas <span class="link">until Sunday evening</span> to accept the deal, or "all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas."</p><p>After Hamas released its statement, Mr. Trump said on Truth Social that he believes the group is "ready for a lasting PEACE." He pushed Israel to cease hostilities in the Gaza Strip.Â </p><p>"Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now, it's far too dangerous to do that. We are already in discussions on details to be worked out," the president wrote.</p>
<p>"In light of Hamas's response, Israel is preparing to immediately implement the first phase of Trump's plan for the immediate release of all hostages," a statement released by Netanyahu's office early Saturday morning local time read. "We will continue to work in full cooperation with the President and his team to end the war in accordance with the principles set forth by Israel that are consistent with President Trump's vision."</p><p>In a separate statement, the Israel Defense Forces said that its high-level military officials held a meeting overnight, in which Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, the IDF chief of staff, "instructed to advance readiness for the implementation of the first phase of the Trump plan for the release of the hostages."</p><p>In a video posted to Truth Social later Friday, Mr. Trump called the deal "unprecedented in many ways" and thanked several Arab and majority Muslim countries that assisted with the deal as mediators, including Qatar and Egypt.</p><p>"This is a big day," Mr. Trump said in the video. "We'll see how it all turns out. We have to get the final word down and concrete."</p>
<h2>Hamas says it's willing to release hostages, hand over control of Gaza</h2><p>Hamas said it is willing to release all living hostages and the remains of deceased hostages "in accordance with the exchange formula set forth in President Trump's proposal." The proposal laid out by the White House called for Hamas to release all hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, within 72 hours, and for Israel to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the conflict.</p><p>The deal also called for an immediate end to fighting if both sides accept the deal, and for Israel's military to withdraw to an "agreed upon line."Â </p><p>Hamas also said it is willing to "hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats), based on Palestinian national consensus and with the support of Arab and Islamic parties" â€” another portion of Mr. Trump's proposal.</p><p>The group was less clear on other portions of the deal. The statement said some aspects of Mr. Trump's proposal "remain linked to a comprehensive national stance, grounded in relevant international laws and resolutions." It said those issues will need to be discussed "within an inclusive Palestinian national framework" that includes Hamas.</p><p>It's not clear if Hamas has agreed that it will play no role in the governance of Gaza, which was one provision of Mr. Trump's proposal.</p><p><span class="link">The plan</span>, unveiled Sept. 29 by Mr. Trump and backed by Netanyahu, called for Hamas to free all remaining Israeli hostages and for the Israeli military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases, starting with an initial withdrawal before the hostages are freed. It also proposed handing over parts of Gaza to a "technocratic" Palestinian committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.</p><p>Netanyahu, who <span class="link">joined Mr. Trump</span> for a joint news conference at the White House when the 20-point proposal was announced, had said he supports the plan, and that if Hamas does not accept the offer, "Israel will finish the job by itself."Â </p>
<p>"We're giving everybody a chance to have this done peacefully," Netanyahu had said, warning Hamas what would happen if they didn't agree to the proposal. "But if Hamas rejects your plan, Mr. President, or if they supposedly accept it and then basically do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself. This can be done the easy way or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done."Â </p><p>The president told Netanyahu on Monday that if Hamas were to reject the proposal, "you'd have our full backing to do what you would have to do.<strong>"</strong></p><p>Mr. Trump had said his goal is to ensure a "sustainable, long-term peace." The president on Monday also said he and Netanyahu were "waiting for signatures and waiting for approvals from a lot of different countries that are involved in this." Â </p><p>Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.</p><p>Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.</p><p><em>Claire Day, Margaret Brennan and Melissa Gaffney contributed to this report.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">FBI weighing a perp walk for Comey â€” and suspended an agent for refusing to</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The FBI is considering carrying out a "showy" arrest and perp walk of the agency's now-indicted ex-Director James Comey, and has suspended an agent who refused to participate in the plan, three sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.</p><p>Comey was <span class="link">charged last week with lying to Congress</span> and obstructing a congressional proceeding, an unprecedented move that came after President Trump publicly pressured Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into his longtime adversary. A grand jury voted to indict him on Sept. 25 and hours later, Comey was issued a summons directing him to appear in federal court in northern Virginia for an Oct. 9 arraignment. His lawyers agreed to bring him to his arraignment, two sources said.</p><p>But on the same day as his indictment, FBI leadership discussed hauling Comey in instead of waiting for the ex-FBI chief to report to court on his own, a source knowledgeable about the conversions told CBS News.</p><p>The source told CBS News that leadership asked for "large, beefy" agents to conduct an arrest of Comey "in full kit," including Kevlar vests and exterior wear emblazoned with the FBI logo. It was suggested that Chris Ray, a supervisory special agent in the violent crimes division of the FBI's Washington Field Office, would be able to put together the kinds of agents who fit the bill, the source said.</p><p>Ray refused to participate in this plan, believing it would be inappropriate and highly unusual for a white-collar defendant like Comey, according to the source. He was then suspended for insubordination.</p>
<p>The FBI is now actively working to put together a team to arrest Comey between now and his court appearance on Thursday, but other FBI supervisors have also refused to cooperate, said a source knowledgeable about the conversions and a law enforcement source familiar with the situation. The expectation is that the FBI will eventually find somebody.</p><p>CBS News has reached out to the FBI for comment. Comey's lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, declined to comment to CBS News.</p><p>Reuters was first to report that an FBI agent was sidelined for refusing to help with a perp walk.</p><p>Law enforcement has long opted to carry out public perp walks for some defendants. The tactic is controversial, with critics arguing it undermines defendants' presumption of innocence. When Comey was the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan during George W. Bush's administration, the New York Civil Liberties Union penned a letter urging him to end the practice, saying it "seems calculated simply to cause public humiliation and embarrassment of the accused."</p>
<p>Comey's indictment marked an escalation in the almost decade-long feud between Mr. Trump and the FBI director he fired in the opening months of his first term. Mr. Trump has castigated Comey over the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and Comey has called Mr. Trump "<span class="link">morally unfit to be president</span>."</p><p>The charges accuse Comey of lying during a Senate hearing five years ago by falsely stating that he hadn't authorized anybody at the FBI to serve as an anonymous source in media reports about investigations into Hillary Clinton. The indictment does not make clear who he allegedly authorized to be an anonymous source, or what the leak entailed.</p><p>Comey has <span class="link">denied wrongdoing</span>.</p><p>The charges followed days of upheaval in the U.S. Attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia, where Comey was indicted. The lead prosecutor in that office, Erik Siebert, resigned from the job <span class="link">two weeks ago</span>, and Mr. Trump replaced him with his former personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan. Less than a week later, Halligan <span class="link">asked a grand jury</span> to indict Comey.Â </p><p>Some staff in the office had circulated a memo that argued charges shouldn't be brought against Comey, a Justice Department source familiar with the matter told CBS News last week.</p><p>The Justice Department has also fired two high-level prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia in the last two weeks, sources familiar with the matter <span class="link">told CBS News</span>.</p>

<div class="article-title">With new album, Swift again turns her lyrical skills into a business strategy</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>New York</em> â€” The world's most recognizable showgirl may be entering a new era, but there's no sign that Taylor Swift's gold rush is slowing down. </p><p>Swift is the only female musical artist in history to sell more than 100 million albums. <span class="link">Her newest album</span>, "The Life of a Showgirl," created a frenzy when it was released Friday. </p><p>"In terms of a business person, Taylor is at the top," said Kevin Evers, author of the new book "There's Nothing Like This: The Strategic Genius of Taylor Swift," and a senior editor at the Harvard Business Review. "She's always been extremely business savvy, and we can see this with this release, too."Â </p><p>Evers says that Swift has always been "really fan-obsessed."</p><p>"So if you look at all the album variants, and all this new stuff that she's doing around this album, she's really trying to give her fans as much value as possible," Evers said. </p>
<p>In August, Swift announced "The Life of a Showgirl" <span class="link">on the popular podcast</span> of her now-fiancÃ©, Travis Kelce. She said the album was inspired by the record-smashing <span class="link">Eras Tour</span>, the first-ever tour to gross more than $2 billion. </p><p>"This album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and, and vibrant," Swift said on the podcast. </p><p>Since then, countdowns on her website appeared for limited edition vinyl records, CDs and cardigans, all of which sold out within minutes. <strong>Â  </strong>"I mean, she's definitely going to make a lot of money from this album, and she's not shy about that," Evers said. "But at the same time, the reason why all these strategies are working is because her fans are actively engaged."</p><p>Fans are flocking to see her film, "Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl," which is in theaters this weekend only.</p>
<p>The album became Spotify's most streamed album in a single day this year. The company said it only took 11 hours to hit that mark. <strong> </strong>"Streaming really does not create a lot of money for artists," Evers explained. "Yes, Taylor Swift is making millions of dollars on streaming, but she's making much more on merch and the vinyl variants."</p>
<p>Some tracks seem to reveal new tidbits of her love story with Kelce, a key player in the album's rollout. It is giving her dedicated fans a look at a new, happier chapter of her life off-stage, and a peek into the future of what could come next.Â </p>

<div class="article-title">Supreme Court lets Trump end deportation protections for 300,000 Venezuelans</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington â€” </em>The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the way for the <span class="link">Trump administration to end</span> temporary legal protections for more than 300,000 Venezuelan migrants.Â </p><p>The high court agreed to freeze a <span class="link">lower court decision that</span> found the Department of Homeland Security illegally terminated the Temporary Protected Status program for Venezuelan migrants, which allowed them to live and work in the U.S. without the threat of immediate deportation.</p><p>By halting the September ruling from U.S. District Judge Edward Chen, the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to move forward with rolling back the legal protections for Venezuelans. This is the second time the high court has green-lit the Department of Homeland Security's move to strip hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans of their temporary legal protections.</p><p>"Although the posture of the case has changed, the parties' legal arguments and relative harms generally have not," the Supreme Court said in an unsigned order. "The same result that we reached in May is appropriate here."</p><p>Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have denied the Trump administration's request for emergency relief, and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.</p>
<p>"We once again use our equitable power (but not our opinion-writing capacity) to allow this Administration to disrupt as many lives as possible, as quickly as possible. I view today's decision as yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket," Jackson wrote in a dissenting opinion.</p><p>DHS called the order a "win for the American people and commonsense" in a post on X.</p><p>"Temporary Protected Status was always supposed to be just that: Temporary. Yet, previous administrations abused, exploited, and mangled TPS into a de facto amnesty program," the agency said.</p><p>The National TPS Alliance, one of the plaintiffs in the case, criticized Friday's order.</p>
<p>"It is heartbreaking that the justices rubber-stamped this administration's unlawful cancellation of TPS. This decision will upend the lives of hundreds of thousands of law-abiding, hard-working TPS holders like myself," plaintiff and National TPS Alliance member Cecilia Gonzalez, who has lived in the U.S. since 2017, said in a statement.</p><p>In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer had argued that the lower court could not review Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to cancel an extension of TPS status for Venezuela and then revoke the country's designation.</p><p>Sauer wrote in a filing that the district court's ruling "impedes important immigration enforcement policies" by allowing 300,000 Venezuelan migrants to stay in the U.S. despite Noem's determination that doing so is "contrary to the national interest."</p><p>The Trump administration's request for emergency relief is the latest in which it has accused lower courts of ignoring Supreme Court orders issued during earlier stages of cases. In this instance, the high court in May <span class="link">allowed the Trump administration</span> to end the TPS program for Venezuelans while legal proceedings moved forward. That decision stemmed from a preliminary order from Chen, who went on to decide the full merits of the case last month.</p><p>The judge ruled the Trump administration's attempt to strip TPS from Venezuelans living in the U.S. was illegal. Chen wrote the Supreme Court's May decision, which he said lacked "any specific rationale," did not bar him from adjudicating the case on the merits and issuing a final decision providing relief.</p><p>"This case arose from action taken post haste by the current DHS Secretary, Kristi Noem, to revoke the legal status of Venezuelan and Haitian TPS holders, sending them back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries," Chen wrote in his ruling. "The Secretary's action in revoking TPS was not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which it was taken but also violates the law."</p><p>But Sauer, the solicitor general, accused the district judge of disregarding the Supreme Court's earlier order, which he said was binding.</p>
<p>"Lower courts cannot treat this Court's orders as good for only one stage of only one case by gesturing at irrelevant distinctions, subjectively grading the persuasiveness of the Court's perceived reasoning, or faulting the Court's terseness," he wrote.</p><p>Congress created the program known as TPS in 1990 to provide temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries beset by wars, natural disasters or other "extraordinary and temporary" conditions that make it dangerous for deportees to return. Migrants from a country designated for TPS cannot be removed from the U.S. and are authorized to work for the length of the designation, which can last for up to 18 months.</p><p>The Biden administration designated Venezuela for TPS in March 2021, and it was later extended. Then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas also re-designated Venezuela for TPS.</p><p>But after the second Trump administration came into power, Noem canceled her predecessor's extension and then rescinded the program for Venezuela, finding that allowing migrants to temporarily stay in the U.S. would be "contrary to the national interest." The secretary said that the TPS program had allowed a significant number of Venezuelan migrants without a path to legal immigration status to settle in the U.S., straining local resources.</p><p>The Trump administration urged Venezuelans shielded through the program to self-deport before the protections would end in April.</p><p>But in February, a group of TPS beneficiaries and the National TPS Alliance challenged the Trump administration's move and sought to have the legal protections reinstated. They succeeded in securing preliminary relief in March and then prevailed on the merits last month.</p><p>The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court to pause the district court's decision while it appealed, but the request was denied.</p>
<p>In its bid for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said federal immigration law forbids courts from second-guessing Noem's decision to end the TPS program for Venezuela.</p><p>"[T]he Secretary determined that even a six-month extension of TPS would harm the United States' 'national security' and 'public safety,' while also straining police stations, city shelters, and aid services in local communities that had reached a breaking point," Sauer wrote. "Moreover, delay of the Secretary's decisions threatens to undermine the United States' foreign policy, which involves complex negotiations with Venezuela."</p><p>But lawyers for the plaintiffs, led by the National TPS Alliance, called the Trump administration's assertion that the district judge ignored the Supreme Court's earlier order "baseless and dangerous."</p><p>They also said that the Supreme Court's earlier order, which allowed the administration to end the temporary deportation protections, caused significant harm to Venezuelans.Â </p><p>"People lost their jobs, were jailed, and ultimately deported to a country that remains extremely unsafe," lawyers wrote in a Supreme Court filing. "The summary judgment order below has provided respite from that harm by restoring the status quo. Disturbing it now will cause massive injuries to Plaintiffs and their loved ones, including many American children."</p><p>The TPS beneficiaries told the court that Noem has exercised "unprecedented authority to vacate a TPS extension at any time, for any reason," which they said violates the TPS system created by Congress.</p><p>Since President Trump returned to the White House, his administration has sought to end programs allowing certain migrants to live and work in the U.S. The Supreme Court has allowed many of the president's immigration policies to move forward, including its <span class="link">cancellation of a program</span> benefiting roughly 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans.</p>
<p>It has also let federal immigration authorities <span class="link">resume sweeping enforcement stops</span> in the Los Angeles area, conducted as part of the campaign to carry out mass deportations of people in the U.S. unlawfully.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Bowling Green, Ohio</em> â€” To show power and dominance, a lot of colleges use real animals as mascots to fire up the crowd at football games. </p><p>Bowling Green State University in Ohio is no exception, only their warrior guide is more Fancy Feast than terrible beast.</p><p>Pudge, Bowling Green's 3-year-old Persian cat, attends every home game. His mere presence is like catnip for their dogged fans. Bowling Green's football players say Pudge has become a phenomenon.</p><p>"There's thousands of people there just to see a cat," one player told CBS News.</p>
<p>Pudge is owned by George Carlson, who also happens to be the team's long snapper.</p>
<p>"People love him, and I guess I can't blame them, because I love him too," Carlson told CBS News of Pudge. </p><p>Carlson first brought Pudge to the locker room earlier this season. At the time, he says the team's morale was low because it had been hit by the injury bug, and so he thought what they needed was a cat. </p><p>Carlson had seen Pudge work miracles before, in his own life.</p><p>"I mean for me, he played a really big role," Carlson said. </p>
<p>Last year, Carlson lost his mother, Cristen, to ovarian cancer.</p><p>"It was very tough for me â€” especially living in a single apartment," Carlson said. "I could get really down. You'd spiral really easily. But the thing is, I could come home to this cat, whose just funny looking, he's slightly odd... It helped a lot. I just think the whole process would have been harder without him."</p><p>And it was that belief, in the healing power of the purr, that brought Pudge to the team and now to his legion of fans.</p>
<p>Home game attendance is up almost 60% this year, according to the school â€” the largest increase for any NCAA Division I football team in the country.</p><p>It's no doubt due, in part, to the long snapper, and the long napper, who have given everyone in this community reason to cheer.</p>

<div class="article-title">CBS News poll finds Americans say political violence unacceptable</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>There's widespread apprehension among Americans: They overwhelmingly decry political violence, saying it is unacceptable.Â </p><p>Yet they also think it will increase in the coming years.</p>
<p>Notably, Americans of all political stripes say violence is unacceptable; there's no meaningful difference between views of partisans on this. There are some differences according to age, though, with older Americans especially likely to call political violence unacceptable, and they do almost universally.</p>
<p>This concern is not entirely new and has even increased over recent years.</p>
<p>Concern over political violence also relates to a majority's pessimism that people of different political stripes can come together.</p><p>It does, however, stand in contrast to a generally positive view that most hold about people, apart from politics: that they do get along, but that politics drives them apart.Â </p>
<p>Older Americans are more likely to think people get along than younger ones. This may be a generational difference, marked by more time spent before a hyper-partisan era; older Americans are even more likely than younger ones to say civility has gotten worse over time.</p>
<p>At the same time, we aren't all talking to each other.</p>
<p>Fewer than half feel comfortable publicly expressing political views. Half the public says they almost <em>never</em> have a political discussion with someone who holds <em>different</em> views. Most say they never have such an interaction online (perhaps because people can readily self-select into groups that agree with them.) And only one in 10 hold such conversations a lot.</p><p>The number who report talking in person to people with different political views is lower than it was <span class="link">four years ago</span>.</p><p>That may be partly because there's a perception about negative outcomes for people who do express views publicly.Â </p>
<p>In general, most think doing so can lead to insults, to threats, or employment problems just as much â€” if not more than â€” more positive outcomes, like finding others who share those views, or building support.</p><p>Majorities of Americans of all ages and across the political spectrum say they don't feel American culture and society respects them. But those who are more comfortable publicly expressing political opinions are more likely to feel that society does respect them.</p><p>Relatedly, big majorities across party lines say the tone and civility of politics has gotten worse. This, too, is not new. Americans have overwhelmingly felt this in recent years, when asked.</p>
<p>When partisans look at the other side of the aisle, do they see political opposition, or <em>enemies</em>? Mostly, it's opposition, not enemies. But that's not universal. Just under half of Democrats say Republicans, when they win, threaten their way of life, much as they said four years ago. Just over a third of Republicans see Democrats as enemies, and that's a little fewer than thought so four years ago; at the time, Democrats had more sway in Washington than they do today.</p><p>And in sum, there is majority pessimism right now that Americans can put aside political views and work out their differences. That pessimism spans party lines, though Republicans are relatively more optimistic than Democrats - and younger Americans are somewhat more optimistic than older ones.</p><p><em>This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,489 U.S. adults interviewed between September 30-October 2, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote. The margin of error is Â±2.2 points.</em></p><p><em>Toplines</em></p>

<div class="article-title">8-year sentence for plot to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Sophie Roske, who pleaded guilty earlier this year to attempting to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022, was sentenced to eight years and one month in jail on Friday, in Greenbelt, Maryland.</p><p>Roske was arrested and charged under a male name but now goes by Sophie Roske, according to her defense attorneys. In April, she pleaded guilty to attempting to kill or kidnap a Supreme Court justice.</p><p>The 97-month sentence was handed down by U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman, who also ordered a lifetime of supervised release.</p><p>The Justice Department will appeal the sentence, said Attorney General Pam Bondi, who called the 97-month prison term "woefully insufficient" and argued it "does not reflect the horrific facts of this case." Prosecutors had asked for a 30-year sentence.</p><p>During sentencing, the judge noted Roske's history of mental health issues and said Roske showed remorse, noting that she called the police on herself before attacking Kavanaugh, but said Roske's conduct was "incredibly serious" and a "significant prison sentence" was warranted.</p>
<p>"Anyone who thinks they can intimidate a judge and [their] family by threatening to harm or engage in violence against them will be caught and punished," Boardman said, adding "whether the target audience sees this message, hears it," is "frankly unknown."</p><p>In court, Roske briefly spoke, apologizing to Justice Kavanaugh.Â </p><p>"I sincerely apologize to the justice and his family for the considerable distress I have put them through," Roske said, adding she was sorry for "contributing to the fear that judges feel while doing their job."Â </p><p>Roske continued, calling her actions "selfish and misguided," before adding, "I have been portrayed as a monster, and this tragic mistake I have made will follow me the rest of my life."</p>
<p>In September, prosecutors asked that Roske face at least 30 years in prison for attempting the "preplanned, coldblooded murder" of Kavanaugh at his home in 2022. <span class="link">Roske</span> was seen by U.S. Marshals getting out of a cab near Kavanaugh's home in the early morning hours before walking up the street away from the home. But Roske then called an emergency line and reported having suicidal thoughts and a firearm in a suitcase. Roske then told the operator of coming from California to kill a "specific United States Supreme Court justice," according to a court filing.</p><p>Roske was then detained without incident, in possession of a black tactical chest rig and tactical knife, a Glock 17 pistol with two magazines and ammunition, pepper spray, zip ties, a hammer, screwdriver, nail punch, crow bar, pistol light, duct tape, hiking boots with padding on the outside of the soles, and other items, an affidavit said.</p><p>In her plea agreement, Roske admitted to traveling from California, where she lived at the time, to Maryland, to attack Kavanaugh and, according to federal prosecutors, aimed to kill three members of the Supreme Court in order to "single-handedly alter the constitutional order for ideological ends."Â </p><p>Roske, prosecutors said Friday, had "ramped up" plans for the attack after the leak of a draft of the Supreme Court decision ending the federal right to an abortion and leaving questions about its legality to the states.Â </p><p>"The defendant researched; planned; procured the tools for the planned killings; traveled across the entirety of the country with those tools, including a gun; and attempted to delete online evidence of motive and intent," prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memorandum.Â </p><p>"The defendant's objective â€” to target and kill judges to seek to alter a court's ruling â€” is an abhorrent form of terrorism and strikes at the core of the United States Constitution and our prescribed system of government," the government said.</p><p>Roske also conducted Google searches for "how much force do you need to stab someone's neck," "most effective way to silently kill someone" and "how to break a lock," according to the sentencing memorandum.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said that a map saved in Roske's Google account contained pins that marked what Roske believed were the homes of four sitting Supreme Court justices. The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority.</p><p>During Friday's sentencing hearing, federal prosecutors displayed some of the materials Roske possessed when arrested, including zip ties, a tactical vest with pepper spray and a knife, a lock-pick set and a hammer.Â </p><p>Justice Department prosecutor Coreen Mao said Friday that Roske's "singular, focused mission"Â  was "terrorism" and she had aimed to "affect the conduct of government," citing Roske's statements to law enforcement after arrest and internet searches for information about Supreme Court justices.Â </p><p>Roske's attorneys did not dispute their client's actions leading up to the planned attack, but cited her yearslong history of mental health issues and an attempted suicide as context to her behavior in planning the attack. Roske's attorneys asked for a sentence of eight years in prison and 25 years of supervised release.Â </p><p>Earlier this month, Roske wrote a letter to Boardman apologizing to Justice Kavanaugh for her actions.</p><p>"I put them through a harrowing experience and for that I am truly sorry. I am very glad I did not continue," Roske wrote. "I am also sorry for contributing to a trend of political violence in American politics."Â </p>

<div class="article-title">Netanyahu ordered drone attacks on Gaza-bound humanitarian boats, sources say</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington</em> â€” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly approved military operations on two vessels early last month that were part of a Gaza-bound flotilla carrying aid and pro-Palestinian supporters, including Swedish climate activist <span class="link">Greta Thunberg</span>, CBS News has learned. Â </p><p>Two American intelligence officials briefed on the matter told CBS News that Israeli forces on Sept. 8 and 9 launched drones from a submarine and dropped incendiary devices onto the boats that were moored outside the Tunisian port of Sidi Bou Said, <span class="link">causing a fire</span>. The officials spoke under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on national security matters.Â </p><p>Under international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict, the use of incendiary weapons against a civilian population or civilian objects is prohibited in all circumstances.Â </p><p>Israel has enforced a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip for more than a decade, first declaring the restriction in January 2009, when its navy announced the closure of the coastal waters to all maritime traffic. The move came some two years after Hamas took control of the region following a brief but violent civil war with the rival Fatah party, the political and military organization of Arab Palestinians, officially known as the Palestinian National Liberation Movement.Â </p><p>The Israel Defense Forces didn't respond to CBS News' request for comment.</p>
<p>The Global Sumud Flotilla organized the international maritime initiative that aims to break through Israel's naval blockade of Gaza and provide aid to the war-torn territory.Â </p><p>On Sept. 8, an incendiary device was dropped onto the Family, a Portuguese-flagged vessel. The Global Sumud Flotilla told CBS News that on the night prior to the attack, Portuguese lawmaker Mariana MortÃ¡gua was on board. The activists believe the perpetrators deliberately waited until "elected officials or high-profile figures were absent," the group said in a statement to CBS News on Friday.</p><p>On Sept. 9, the Alma, a British-flagged vessel, was attacked in a similar manner as the Family. In both cases, the group said last month that the boats were damaged by the fire but the crew was able to extinguish the flames quickly. No one was killed or injured.Â </p>
<p>"Confirmation of Israeli involvement would not surprise us; it would simply lay bare a pattern of arrogance and impunity so grotesque that it cannot escape eventual reckoning," the Global Sumud Flotilla said in its statement Friday.Â </p>
<p>The statement added: "Whether the purpose of these attacks was to kill us, scare us away, or disable our boats, they recklessly endangered civilians and humanitarian volunteers. The world must take note: attempts to silence, intimidate, or obstruct our commitment to the Palestinian cause and people will not succeed. We call for urgent, independent investigations into these attacks and full accountability for those responsible."</p><p>In September, Tunisian authorities disputed that drones dropping incendiary devices caused the fire, instead claiming that an initial inspection indicated the explosion originated inside the boat, according to BBC News. Pro-Israeli accounts on social media claimed the fires were started after the activists did not use a flare gun properly.Â </p><p>Footage released by the Global Sumud Flotilla and obtained by CBS News appears to show a ball of flames falling onto the boat, sparking the fire on board, instead of the fire originating from inside the vessel. The stationary cameras affixed to the vessels do not capture where the flames originated from prior to landing on the boat nor do they depict a flare gun being fired.Â </p><p>In separate incidents in late September, the activist group <span class="link">said</span> they were attacked by 15 low-altitude drones while sailing south of Greece. The Global Sumud Flotilla said at least 13 explosions were heard on and around several flotilla boats and objects were dropped on at least 10 boats, causing damage. While no casualties were reported, the activist group said that their communications systems were also disrupted.Â </p><p>This week, Israeli naval forces <span class="link">intercepted</span> most of the vessels bound for Gaza, detaining dozens of activists along with Thunberg and several European lawmakers, a move that drew swift international criticism.Â </p><p>American citizens travelling on the flotilla have also been detained by Israel. A State Department official told CBS News that the department was monitoring the situation and is committed to providing assistance to U.S. citizens. The official also called the flotilla a "deliberate and unnecessary provocation," particularly as the Trump administration continues to seek a <span class="link">negotiated solution</span> to end the war in Gaza.Â </p><p>Two Americans sailing with the Global Sumud Flotilla include Marine Corps veteran Jessica Clotfelter and Greg Stoker, organizer of the veterans' delegation to the group. On Wednesday, they <span class="link">spoke</span> via Zoom to CBS News Chicago roughly an hour before the Israeli navy intercepted the flotilla.Â </p>
<p>"We are a civilian aid mission, trying to break the siege into Gaza, and we are carrying humanitarian aid in accordance with international humanitarian and maritime law," said Stoker.Â </p><p>Clotfelter told CBS News Chicago that the images that have been coming out of Gaza for the last two years have been "heartbreaking" and "gut-wreching."Â </p><p>She added: "I mean, I've cried probably every single day on this boat as the violence since we've taken off on 31 August has escalated."</p>

<div class="article-title">Appeals court upholds decision against Trump's view on birthright citizenship</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington</em> â€” A federal appeals court on Friday became the latest court to determine the Trump administration's effort to end <span class="link">birthright citizenship</span>Â is likely unconstitutional.Â </p><p>In a 100-page ruling, the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Boston district court's injunction that blocked the government from enforcing anÂ <span class="link">executive order</span>Â signed by President Trump to significantly narrow birthright citizenship, the concept that people born in the U.S. are automatically citizens, regardless of their parents' immigration status. The appeals court ruled in favor of plaintiff states and against the Trump administration.Â </p><p><span class="link">Other cases</span>Â challenging the president's effort to restrict birthright citizenship have been making their way through the courts, and they haven't been decided in the president's favor. Â </p><p>"Our nation's history of efforts to restrict birthright citizenship â€” from Dred Scott in the decade before the Civil War to the attempted justification for the enforcement of the Chinese Exclusion Act in Wong Kim Ark â€” has not been a proud one," the court's chief justice wrote. "Indeed, those efforts each have been rejected, once by the people through constitutional amendment in 1868 and once by the court relying on the same amendment three decades later, and at a time when tensions over immigration were also high."</p><p>"The 'lessons of history' thus give us every reason to be wary of now blessing this most recent effort to break with our established tradition of recognizing birthright citizenship and to make citizenship depend on the actions of one's parents rather than â€” in all but the rarest of circumstances â€” the simple fact of being born in the United States," the appeals court concluded.Â </p>
<p>CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment on the ruling.</p><p>In Mr. Trump's first week in office, he signed an executive order that <span class="link">sought to end</span> birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868, has long been interpreted to automatically grant citizenship to virtually everybody born on U.S. soil, even if their parents are in the country illegally or temporarily. Federal judges in several states have <span class="link">blocked the order</span> from taking effect.</p><p>The Trump administration <span class="link">has asked</span> the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship executive order in two different cases, one brought by four states and another by parents whose children would be impacted by the policy.</p><p>The birthright citizenship issue reached the high court earlier this year, but the justices did not rule on the merits, instead <span class="link">curtailing lower court judges' power</span> to issue nationwide injunctions blocking Mr. Trump's executive order.</p>

<div class="article-title">RFK Jr. fires NIH vaccine whistleblower Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has fired a top official with the National Institutes of Health who blew the whistle on internal <span class="link">clashes over vaccine research</span> in the early months of the Trump administration.</p><p>On Wednesday, Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo received a letter from Kennedy â€” which CBS News reviewed â€” informing her that her role leading NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, had been terminated. He did not cite a cause beyond his constitutional authority to do so. Last month, in an exclusive interview with CBS News, Marrazzo said she had been silenced when she and her colleagues pushed back against NIH officials appointed by President Trump who questioned the importance of childhood flu vaccines and canceled long-running clinical trials. Â </p><p>"My termination, unfortunately, shows that the leaders of HHS and the National Institutes of Health do not share my commitment to scientific integrity and public health," Marrazzo wrote in a statement following her firing. "Congress must act to protect scientific research from those who would serve political interests first."</p><p>Marrazzo had been in her role since August 2023, succeeding Dr. Anthony Fauci, who had served as NIAID director for nearly four decades. She was put on indefinite leave in March and filed a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel in September, alleging illegal retaliation. In a statement, Marrazzo's attorney alleged her firing is further "retaliation for her protected whistleblower activity."</p><p>Despite following a well-established whistleblower process by filing a complaint with OSC, recourse for Marrazzo is far from certain. Mr. Trump <span class="link">fired the head of the independent agency</span> in February and has since installed his top trade official Jamieson Greer to lead the agency on an acting basis.Â </p>
<p>In August, the office launched an ethics probe into <span class="link">Jack Smith</span>, the former special counsel who indicted Mr. Trump before he returned to office for his actions around the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and for allegedly mishandling classified documents from his first term.</p><p>The allegations in Marrazzo's whistleblower complaint focus on Dr. Matthew Memoli, who served as acting NIH director earlier this year before moving to the health agency's No. 2 post.</p><p>Marrazzo claimed Memoli made statements downplaying the importance of vaccines that closely mirrored the views of Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic. In a series of meetings, Memoli argued that "vaccines are unnecessary if populations are healthy," and that the NIH "should not focus on vaccines," Marrazzo alleged in her complaint.</p><p>Marrazzo told CBS News it was like "hearing the echo of" the vaccine skepticism often promoted by Kennedy. "It was extremely alarming," Marrazzo said.</p>
<p>An HHS spokesperson defended Memoli to CBS News, writing in a statement: "He remains fully aligned with this administration's vaccine priorities and consistently champions gold-standard evidence-based science."Â </p><p>In June, Kennedy <span class="link">removed</span> all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Vaccine Practices, which makes vaccine recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control. He then handpicked their replacements, and the newly reconstituted panel recently voted to endorse a <span class="link">change in guidelines</span> for the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine, recommending children under 4 get them in two separate shots.Â </p>

<div class="article-title">Legal experts condemn Apple bowing to White House's request to remove ICE tracking app</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Apple and Google on Thursday removed apps that alert people when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are nearby following pressure from Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p> <p>Critics of the tech giants capitulating to the Trump administration say it shows the sway President Trump has over Silicon Valley in his second term.</p> <p>Apple said it yanked an app called ICEBlock from its app store after the "safety risks" of the app were made known to the company. The anonymous, crowd-sourced app describes itself as "Waze but for ICE sightings," and claims to serve as an early warning system informing people when ICE agents are nearby.</p>
<p>The app was launched in April and garnered hundreds of thousands of downloads, but it was only after Attorney General Pam Bondi put Apple on notice, demanding the app be pulled from the App Store, that the company made it unavailable.</p> <p>"We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store â€” and Apple did so," said Bondi in a statement to Fox News.</p> <p>The Justice Department did not respond to NPR's questions about its request. </p> <p>Since the app never had an Android version, it was not on Google's Play Store. Still, a company spokesperson told NPR that it, too, "removed similar apps for violations of our policies," falling in line with Apple's actions.</p> <p>The developer of ICEBlock, Joshua Aaron, said he made the app in response to the Trump administration's stepped up immigration enforcement. After it was booted from Apple's app store, Aaron blamed political pressure and vowed to fight it.</p> <p>He argued the app's service was engaged in a type of protected speech not unlike some of Apple's own apps, like the company's mapping app which allows users to crowdsource accidents, hazards and police speed traps along roadways.</p> <p>"Capitulating to an authoritarian regime is never the right move," Aaron said in a statement.</p>
<p>Apple's action has reignited the debate about what's known as jawboning, when government officials censor speech through intimidation and threats.</p>
<p>Conservatives for years accused the Biden administration of this tactic over communications it had with tech companies related to accounts that were spreading COVID and election misinformation.</p> <p>Jimmy Kimmel's brief suspension by ABC following comments from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr was widely regarded by legal experts as illegal jawboning.</p>
<p>Kate Ruane, Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology's Free Expression Project, said Apple's move should also be viewed as the government's heavy hand muzzling free expression.</p> <p>"When companies agree to the administration's demands in order to achieve some other goal, whether it be avoiding tariffs or getting merger approval, they send a message to others that it's ok to do the same,"Ruane said. "What's worse, they erode the promise of the First Amendment for all of us at the same time."</p>
<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has made strides to ingratiate himself with Trump, as the administration enacts an aggressive tariff policy that could hurt Apple's bottom line, since much of its production happens in China, India and elsewhere overseas.</p> <p>Cook in August walked into the White House and gave Trump a 24-karat gold plaque, a move that has come to symbolize Silicon Valley's deference to the president.</p>
<p>Trump has given Apple and other tech companies something of a gift, too, by exempting smartphones, including Apple's iPhones, from tariffs.</p> <p>"I think many large organizations are trying to keep their metaphorical heads down and act cautiously, even when the government is acting improperly or even unconstitutionally," said Gautam Hans, a law professor at Cornell University, who believes Apple would have a jawboning case but does not expect the company to pursue it. "Compliance will only incentivize further government demands."</p>

<div class="article-title">Denmark prepares for a Russian 'hybrid war' after repeated drone spottings</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>COPENHAGEN, Denmark â€” Trine, a hotel receptionist in the Danish capital, has had trouble sleeping recently. She is too nervous about the unsettling noise of unidentified drones hovering in the night.</p> <p>"I live very near the airport, so every night these helicopters and stuff are going around and around," she said, making a whirring sound. "I really need to sleep."</p> <p>She's not the only one whose nerves were frayed in Denmark.</p> <p>Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen says a "hybrid war" in Europe is underway, describing it as "the most difficult and dangerous situation since the end of the Second World War."</p>
<p>The government has not officially pinpointed who staged the drone flights, but Prime Minister Frederiksen said: "There is only one country willing to threaten us and it is Russia, and therefore we need a very strong answer back."</p>
<p>On Friday, the Danish Defence Intelligence Service said Russia is putting pressure on Denmark with "hybrid warfare," which the agency defined as a combination of political, economic, information and military means "to undermine a state while remaining below the threshold of armed conflict."</p> <p>The United States and other NATO countries rushed military, law enforcement and technical resources to the Denmark this week to protect high-level meetings of European leaders in Copenhagen. Officials deemed the unidentified drones entering Denmark's airspace a serious security risk.</p>
<p>After 3 1/2 years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, European countries like this one â€” Kyiv's backers and military suppliers â€” are nervous the Kremlin could bring the conflict their way. Denmark, a NATO and European Union member with about 6 million people, is on high alert after the recent airspace incursions.</p> <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied any plans to invade NATO countries. Speaking on Thursday in Sochi, Putin accused Europe of "whipping up hysteria" about a "Russian threat."</p> <p>But this, Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard warned on national television, is Denmark's "new reality."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Danes are very worried</h3> <p>"Everybody is talking about it," Trine says about the drones, adding that her family is "very, very worried."</p> <p>NPR agreed not to use the last names of some of those interviewed in this story, because of the panic around this security issue.</p> <p>Trine says being nervous made her take stock of her family's emergency plans. "We prepped, we prepared," she explained, checking their canned food supply, stocking up on water and reviewing their plan with other family members in case they have to evacuate their home in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>For Trine's family â€” which includes a "fat bulldog that can't run," she notes â€” the plan would be to regroup at her father's house "far, far out in the country." She says, "It's a big house," with "room for everybody, me and my family, my brother and his family and my mom and everybody and the animals as well."</p> <p>She says she has heard from some friends who have more elaborate plans, that include even leaving Denmark if necessary.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Stocking up for an emergency</h3> <p>Like other Nordic governments, Denmark has long urged citizens to store enough supplies to survive a minimum of three days with no access to electricity, food or fresh water. Without the feeling of a direct threat, many people were complacent about actually doing that.</p>
<p>But that's changed. Since the drones first appeared Sept. 22, the guidelines have been discussed widely in the media, along with attempts to avoid panic. Residents appeared to be taking them more seriously than before, with headlines about runs on canned fish and battery-powered radios.</p>
<p>At a home goods store in a Copenhagen suburb, sales associate Peter Sandell says 20 liter water containers are a hot item. "This morning we had this, this, this and this full," he says, gesturing to a shoulder-high level of where the plastic jugs had been stacked hours earlier.</p> <p>Nearby, the shelf for camping stoves is empty. Alejandra and Alexander, a couple who also want to be identified only by first names, snagged the last one. Alejandra's arms are full of fuel canisters. </p>
<p>She says they hadn't necessarily intended to buy one that day, but then they saw people walking out of the store with them and thought impulsively, "OK, let's just buy [it] just in case."</p> <p>The couple explains they had stocked up on items like water before, but the drone incidents prompted them to hurry to complete the emergency list.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Make sure shelters are ready</h3> <p>Danish authorities have some catching up to do as well, says Jakob Hallgren, a former Swedish ambassador who is director of the Swedish Institute of International Affairs.</p>
<p>Sweden also went through a period like this shortly after the start of Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine in 2022, Hallgren explains. But then the country reassessed the risk of being so close to the front line, and invested a lot in things like renovating and expanding its network of bomb shelters.</p> <p>Hallgren advises that the Danish government do the same. "Living in Denmark you might have â€” just as maybe also in Sweden until a couple of years ago â€” kind of thought that you were shielded from these developments," he says. "But this is obviously no longer the case. So if they haven't, it's really high time to make sure that those shelters are repaired and that there is proper information about where you can find them."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Down with the drones</h3> <p>Many Danes are disappointed the government has not issued orders to shoot down the drones. Trine says she'd be happy to help, saying she joked to her policeman husband that she'd like to borrow one of his weapons.</p> <p>"He looked at me, [like] 'are you kidding?' " she laughs. "And then my daughter â€” she's 20 â€” she said 'aw, come on, Dad give her a bazooka.' " </p> <p>Trine emphasizes that while she was kidding about taking things into her own hands, she definitely hopes the Danish government does shoot down the drones if they disrupt Danish skies again.</p>

<div class="article-title">Sean Combs sentenced to over four years in prison for prostitution-related charges</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>On Friday, Sean Combs was sentenced by a federal judge to 50 months in prison. The 55-year-old music mogul was convicted in July on two counts of transportation for prostitution, but acquitted on more serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy.</p> <p>After a daylong hearing that culminated in Combs himself addressing the judge, speaking at length for the first time during the trial, Judge Arun Subramanian said that a significant sentence was required to "send a message to abusers and victims alike that exploitation and violence against women is met with real accountability."</p> <p>Subramanian made his decision after hearing arguments from federal prosecutors, Combs' defense attorneys and Combs himself. His defense attorneys had argued that their client should receive no more than 14 months behind bars. With time already served, that would have meant he'd be released by the end of the year. Federal prosecutors, on the other hand, requested that Subramanian sentence Combs to no less than 11 years and three months in prison. The maximum sentence for the two charges is 20 years.</p>
<p>The hearing was a tense and serious affair, the culmination of a sometimes circus-like, eight-week trial defined by emotionally-charged testimony, celebrity appearances and a buzzing courthouse packed with hordes of Combs' supporters, social media influencers and reporters. Federal prosecutors spent six weeks presenting an elaborate, sometimes meandering case that accused Combs of operating a criminal organization that enabled and concealed sex crimes for decades. Their two main witnesses, the singer Cassie Ventura and a woman who testified using the pseudonym "Jane," told the court that Combs lured them into romantic relationships and then controlled most aspects of their lives, repeatedly forcing them into drug-fueled sex marathons with male escorts.</p>
<p>Combs did not testify during the trial itself, but he made his case for leniency directly to Judge Subramanian at the end of the day-long sentencing hearing. In a 10-minute address, he apologized to Ventura and Jane as well as to all domestic violence survivors who may have been triggered by the CNN video.</p> <p>"My actions were disgusting, shameful and sick," Combs said. "I have been humbled and broken down to my core. I hate myself right now."</p> <p>There was a short break after Combs spoke, before Judge Subramanian returned to deliver the sentence. In his remarks, he focused first on the witnesses who testified about abuse at Combs' hands. He quoted Jane's testimony and read directly from a victim impact statement Ventura submitted. Then addressed those witnesses directly, applauding their bravery for speaking out. "What you taught us here by coming forward is even if you were a victim, you don't always have to be," he said.</p>
<p>Speaking to Combs, Judge Subrmanian said that "abuse is not something you can wash away." When the judge announced the sentence, Combs remained stoic.</p> <p>In a statement following the hearing, Ventura's attorneys Douglas Wigdor and Meredith Firetog said, "While nothing can undo the trauma caused by Combs, the sentence imposed today recognizes the impact of the serious offenses he committed. We are confident that with the support of her family and friends, Ms. Ventura will continue healing knowing that her bravery and fortitude have been an inspiration to so many."</p> <p>Combs has been held in a Brooklyn jail since his arrest last September. With the time he has already served and a reduced sentence for good behavior, he could be released in as little as two and a half years, based on federal guidelines. His sentence also includes a $500,000 fine, the maximum allowable for his conviction, as well as five years of supervised release.</p> <p>Combs' defense team spent much of the trial fighting charges of sex trafficking by working to discredit the testimony of women who alleged that Combs had abused them. Much of this strategy relied on presented text message evidence in which Ventura and Jane each appeared to be agreeing to the encounters and helping to plan them during confrontational cross-examination. After the prosecution presented more than two dozen witnesses â€” including Combs' former employees, federal agents and friends of the alleged victims â€” the defense called none, and rested its case in under 30 minutes. Ultimately, a jury acquitted Combs of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, but found him guilty of transporting Jane and Ventura across state lines to engage in commercial sex.</p> <p>Despite Combs' acquittal on the most serious charges, nobody â€” not even his own lawyers â€” denied that he caused harm. A key piece of evidence in the case was a 2016 surveillance video of Combs beating Ventura in a hotel hallway. Throughout the trial, Combs' defense attorneys conceded that their client had a history of domestic violence, but argued the government was not charging him for those crimes.</p>
<p>During Friday's sentencing hearing, several of Combs' defense attorneys spoke on his behalf, detailing his self-made journey to becoming a record producer, rapper and entrepreneur, and underscoring what he represents to the Black community as a successful businessman who broke barriers in music, fashion and media. One of his attorneys broke down in tears as she addressed the judge, explaining his importance to the Black community, and to her personally. The defense contended that Combs had reformed while in prison, getting sober and becoming a mentor to many inmates around him. They also argued that he needs ongoing treatment for mental health and substance abuse challenges.</p>
<p>Midway through the arguments by Combs' attorneys, Six of the rapper's children approached the podium together and made emotional pleas to the judge. Combs' twin daughters discussed how hard it was to lose their mother â€” referring to the 2018 death of Combs' ex-girlfriend Kim Porter â€” and asked the judge not to take away their father, as well. When Combs spoke later, he told his kids he was very proud of them for speaking up.</p> <p>Prosecutors pointed to Combs' violent behavior as a justification for a longer sentence. Subramanian echoed that argument in his address to Combs as he delivered the sentence. Speaking about the abuse suffered by Ventura and Jane, he asked, "Why did it happen so long? Because you had the power and resources to keep it going, and because you didn't get caught."</p> <p>During his address, Combs said that if released, he hoped to work with and teach other incarcerated men. "I'm sorry to my community. I let y'all down," he said.</p> <p>While delivering his sentence, Judge Subramanian commended Combs for his charity work and devotion to his family, as well as his dedication to uplifting communities of color. And he acknowledged that the sentence was longer than Combs might have expected, but implored him to think of the difference he could make after serving his time.</p>
<p>"You and your family, you are going to get through this," he said. "There is a light at the end of this tunnel."</p> <p><em>This article includes reporting by </em><em>Juliana Kim</em><em>.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Hamas says it accepts some elements of Gaza peace plan after Trump issues ultimatum</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip â€” Hamas said Friday that it has accepted some elements of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in the Gaza Strip, including giving up power and releasing all remaining hostages, but that others require further consultations among Palestinians.</p> <p>The statement came hours after Trump said that Hamas must agree to the deal by Sunday evening, threatening an even greater military onslaught nearly two years into the war sparked by the Oct. 7 attack into Israel. It was unclear how the U.S. and Israel would respond to partial acceptance.</p>
<p>Hamas said it was willing to release hostages according to the plan's "formula," likely referring to the release of Palestinian prisoners. It also reiterated its longstanding openness to handing power over to a politically independent Palestinian body.</p> <p>But it said aspects of the proposal touching on the future of the Gaza Strip and Palestinian rights should be decided on the basis of a "unanimous Palestinian stance" reached with other factions and based on international law.</p> <p>The statement also made no mention of Hamas disarming, a key Israeli demand included in Trump's proposal.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Trump's plan would end the fighting and return hostages</h3> <p>Trump appears keen to deliver on pledges to end the war and return dozens of hostages ahead of the second anniversary of the attack on Tuesday. His peace plan has been accepted by Israel and welcomed internationally, but key mediators Egypt and Qatar have also said some elements need further negotiation, without elaborating.</p> <p>"An Agreement must be reached with Hamas by Sunday Evening at SIX (6) P.M., Washington, D.C. time," Trump wrote Friday on social media. "Every Country has signed on! If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas. THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER."</p>
<p>Under the plan, which Trump unveiled earlier this week alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Hamas would immediately release the remaining 48 hostages â€” around 20 of them believed to be alive. It would also give up power and disarm.</p> <p>In return, Israel would halt its offensive and withdraw from much of the territory, release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and allow an influx of humanitarian aid and eventual reconstruction. Plans to relocate much of Gaza's population to other countries would be shelved.</p> <p>The territory of some 2 million Palestinians would be placed under international governance, with Trump himself and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair overseeing it. The plan provides no path for eventual reunification with the Israeli-occupied West Bank in a future Palestinian state.</p> <p>A Hamas official told The Associated Press this week that some elements of the plan are unacceptable and need to be amended, without elaborating. Palestinians long for an end to the war, but many view this and previous U.S. proposals as strongly favoring Israel.</p> <h3 class="edTag">U.S. and Israel seek to pressure Hamas</h3> <p>Israel has sought to ramp up pressure on Hamas since ending an earlier ceasefire in March. It sealed the territory off from food, medicine and other goods for 2 1/2 months and has seized, flattened and largely depopulated large areas of the territory.</p> <p>Experts determined that Gaza City had slid into famine shortly before Israel launched a major offensive aimed at occupying it. An estimated 400,000 people have fled the city in recent weeks, but hundreds of thousands more have stayed behind.</p> <p>Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the U.N. humanitarian office, said she saw several displaced families staying in the parking lot of Shifa Hospital during a visit on Thursday.</p> <p>"They are not able to move south because they just cannot afford it," Cherevko told The Associated Press. "One of the families had three children and the woman was pregnant with her fourth. And there were many other vulnerable cases there, including elderly people and people with disabilities."</p>
<p>Trump wrote that most of Hamas' fighters are "surrounded and MILITARILY TRAPPED, just waiting for me to give the word, 'GO,' for their lives to be quickly extinguished. As for the rest, we know where and who you are, and you will be hunted down, and killed."</p> <p>Most of Hamas' top leaders in Gaza and thousands of its fighters have already been killed, but it still has influence in areas not controlled by the Israeli military and launches sporadic attacks that have killed and wounded Israeli soldiers.</p> <p>Hamas has held firm to its position that it will only release the remaining hostages â€” its sole bargaining chip and potential human shields â€” in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu has rejected those terms, saying Hamas must surrender and disarm.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Second anniversary approaches</h3> <p>Thousands of Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, attacking army bases, farming communities and an outdoor music festival, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. They abducted 251 others, most of them since released in ceasefires or other deals.</p> <p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 66,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. It says women and children make up around half the dead.</p> <p>The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, and the U.N. and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.</p> <p>The offensive has displaced around 90% of Gaza's population, often multiple times, and left much of the territory uninhabitable.</p> <p>Both the Biden and Trump administrations have tried to end the fighting and bring back the hostages while providing extensive military and diplomatic support to Israel.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Shutdown has already delayed the jobs report. More critical reports could be held up</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>For economists who follow the job market, the first Friday of the month is usually like Christmas morning.  That's when the Labor Department ordinarily delivers its closely-watched report on jobs and unemployment.  </p>
<p>But the first Friday of October brought nothing but a lump of coal, after the jobs report was postponed by the government shutdown.  </p> <p>Instead of sitting at her computer at 8:30 am, anxiously refreshing the screen to see the report, Allison Shrivastava spent an idle morning with nothing to do. </p> <p>"I guess I'll just slowly sip my coffee," says Shrivastava, an economist with Indeed, the job search website. "Take the dog for an extra long walk." </p> <h3 class="edTag">A lot is packed into the jobs report</h3> <p>The monthly jobs report is one of the government's most closely-watched economic indicators. It can move financial markets when hiring is stronger â€” or weaker than expected. And it offers a wealth of detail about which industries are growing, or shrinking, and which workers are entering or leaving the job market.  </p>
<p>"The jobs report is every labor economist's favorite time of the month," says Daniel Zhao, chief economist at Glassdoor.   </p> <p>But not this month.  Like other federal agencies, the Labor Department has furloughed the number crunchers who assemble the report, so it won't be released until the government shutdown is resolved. </p> <p>"This website is currently not being updated due to the suspension of Federal government services," said a note on the site where the jobs report is ordinarily published. "Updates to the site will start again when the Federal government resumes operations."</p> <h3 class="edTag">What economists had expected</h3> <p>Today's report was expected to show that employers added about 50,000 jobs in September.  That would be a pickup from the 22,000 jobs added the previous month, but a big slowdown compared to the 240,000 jobs added this time last year. </p>
<p>Some slowdown is inevitable, given the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants which is reducing the labor supply. But it's not clear how much of the recent drop is the result of fewer jobs, or fewer available workers.  </p> <p>"I think everybody agrees that it's not the kind of job growth we had a year ago," says University of Michigan economist Betsey Stevenson, who was a White House economist in the Obama administration. "We can't sustain job growth that's that quick and get rid of a lot of our foreign-born workers."  </p>
<p>As job growth has slowed in recent months, many of the gains have been concentrated in health care â€” which tends to be insulated from the ups and downs of the broader economy.  </p> <h3 class="edTag">Finding a job has become more difficult</h3> <p>Overall, there haven't been a lot of layoffs, but it's been a tough time for anyone trying to land a first job.</p> <p>"Because there's been so much uncertainty, I think everybody â€” employers and job-seekers alike â€” are kind of just holding their breath and trying to hold out for as long as they can to make kind of a decision," says Indeed's Shrivastava. </p> <p>But anyone hoping for clues from the jobs report is out of luck, at least for now. </p>
<p>Until the shutdown is resolved, businesses and policymakers will have to make their best guesses about which way the economy is going.  That would be hard enough if it were coasting on a steady course.  But it's more challenging at a moment of economic transition â€” like driving on a winding road on a foggy night, and having your headlights and your GPS conk out. </p> <p>"We're in a time where the economy is changing, and that makes data more valuable than it is in a regular time," says Stevenson.  </p> <h3 class="edTag">The critical inflation report could also be delayed</h3> <p>To be sure, there other sources of information about the labor market:  Payroll processors report on how many direct deposits they make, and job search websites can tally their "help wanted" ads. </p> <p>But economists agree there's no substitute for the reach of the federal government's number crunchers, even if the Trump administration has cut their staffing and fired the commissioner who used to oversee the jobs report.</p> <p>"There's no making up for a survey that captures tens of millions of employees," Stevenson says. "There's nothing that is close to that." </p>
<p>In addition to postponing the jobs report, the government shutdown has halted collection of information for future reports, including the September inflation report which is due to be published in less than two weeks.  </p> <p>A government shutdown in 2013 that lasted 16 days delayed a wide variety of economic releases over the next two months.</p> <p>Glassdoor's Zhao is hoping for a faster resolution of this shutdown, so he can go back to happily unwrapping the jobs report on the first Friday of every month.  </p> <p>"We've got our fingers crossed," he says.   </p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The Supreme Court waded Friday back into gun-rights in a case that tests the constitutionality of a Hawaii law that restricts where gun owners can carry their weapons.</p> <p>At issue is the state law that bans guns on private property that is open to the public â€” places like clubs, bars and restaurants â€” unless the property's owners have allowed them. The Ninth Circuit, which oversees Hawaii, held that the 2023 law is constitutional. The Second Circuit disagreed and paused an identical New York law.</p> <p>The U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 struck down a century-old gun law in New York and ruled that there is a a constitutional right to carry a handgun in public for self defense. The court could use the Hawaii case to further broaden gun rights.</p>
<p>Historical analysis will be at the heart of the arguments at the court in this case. In the Ninth Circuit, Hawaii cited a 1771 New Jersey law and an 1865 Louisiana law that mandated gun wielders get owner consent before bringing guns onto any form of private property. </p> <p>The gun owners challenging this law argue that the Louisiana and New Jersey laws are historical outliers. And they note that the state law restricts Hawaiians' ability to live their lives as they can be barred from social spaces. </p>

<div class="article-title">The Trump-Epstein statue is back on the National Mall, days after its abrupt removal</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A statue of President Trump skipping hand-in-hand with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has returned to D.C.'s National Mall, over a week after it was abruptly removed in the pre-dawn hours.</p> <p>The bronze-painted statue, originally titled <em>Best Friends Forever </em>but since renamed <em>Why Can't We Be Friends?</em>, turned heads when it appeared in front of the U.S. Capitol on Sept. 23. Its plaque celebrates "the long-lasting bond between President Donald J. Trump and his 'closest friend,' Jeffrey Epstein."</p> <p>Trump has sought to downplay his friendship with the disgraced financier, who died in jail in August 2019. He maintains they had a falling out sometime before Epstein was indicted for soliciting prostitution in 2006, at least in part due to Epstein poaching employees â€” including young women â€” who worked at Trump's Mar-a-Lago spa.</p>
<p>Last week, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NPR in a statement that "it's not news that Epstein knew Donald Trump, because Donald Trump kicked Epstein out of his club for being a creep."</p> <p>A group called The Secret Handshake â€” which was behind other satirical anti-Trump statues in D.C. over the past year â€” obtained a permit from the National Park Service (NPS) to display the friendship statue through Sept. 28, according to records shared with NPR. But U.S. Park Police hauled it onto a truck and carried it away before sunrise on Sept. 24, less than a full day after it appeared.</p> <p>A Secret Handshake group member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation from the Trump administration, told NPR over email at the time that they did not get 24 hours' written notice as required by the permit.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior told NPR that the statue was removed "because it was not compliant with the permit issued," though did not specify how. The White House did not respond to NPR's questions about the statue's removal.</p> <p>The group was later able to recover the statue â€” with the figures ripped from their pedestals and broken into pieces â€” and set about trying to re-erect it. One week and one failed attempt later, <em>Why Can't We Be Friends?</em> returned to the Mall on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Just like a toppled confederate general forced back onto a public square, the Donald Trump Jeffrey Epstein statue has risen from the rubble to stand gloriously on the National Mall once again," The Secret Handshake member wrote in an email to NPR.</p>
<p>The statue is permitted to remain on the Mall through 8 p.m. local time on Oct. 6.</p> <p>This is actually the third permit the group has received for this statue. Late last week, the group told NPR it had applied for and received a second permit to install the repaired statue in the same spot. It said they were on their way to the Mall when NPS suddenly revoked their permit by phone "without explanation." That prompted the group to release 3D-printable versions of the statue online.</p>
<p>NPR has reached out to NPS for comment but did not hear back by publication time. The federal government has shut down since last week's events, putting thousands of the agency's employees on furlough.</p> <p>The Trump administration continues to face calls to release the "Epstein files," a trove of documents from various investigations into Epstein that then-candidate Trump had vowed to release if reelected. His refusal to do so has prompted criticism and pressure from Congress, with the House Oversight Committee subpoenaing â€” and publishing â€” thousands of pages of documents in its own investigation.</p> <p>A NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released Wednesday found that 61% of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of the Epstein files, with 77% in favor of their release with the victims' names removed.</p>

<div class="article-title">GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The White House and congressional Republicans say that Democratic lawmakers caused the federal government shutdown as part of an effort to extend health care benefits to undocumented immigrants. However, as several independent experts interviewed by NPR note, that claim is false.</p> <p>At the center of the standoff is the Trump administration's Working Families Tax Cut Act, also known as President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," signed into law in July. </p> <p>Democrats say it amounts to tax breaks for billionaires and pays for them with deep Medicaid cuts. The White House insists the law protects taxpayers by preventing undocumented immigrants from getting government health benefits â€” but such individuals were already barred from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, exchanges.</p>
<p>"It's a complete distortion," says Leighton Ku, the director of George Washington University's Center for Health Policy Research. It is "simply wrong in the details," he says.</p> <p>In the weeks ahead of the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year, when funding for the federal government was due to expire, GOP lawmakers introduced a continuing resolution to extend the funding until Nov. 21. But Democrats demanded that it also include an extension of ACA subsidies â€” set to expire at the end of the year â€” and the reversal of Medicaid cuts.</p> <p>Republicans have accused the Democrats of holding the government hostage to a "far-left wish list," including funding the health care of "illegal aliens." The White House has said the Republicans' legislation ensures "that taxpayer dollars are focused on American citizens and do not subsidize healthcare for illegal immigrants."</p> <p>Jonathan Gruber, the chairman of the Economics Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says the Republican claim is false. People living in the U.S. who are undocumented "do not qualify for Medicaid. They do not qualify for tax credits on the [ACA health care] exchanges," he says.</p> <p>KFF, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that analyzes national health issues, notes that U.S. health coverage programs for immigrants are generally limited to those lawfully present. Medicaid and CHIP â€” which provides low-cost coverage to uninsured children and pregnant women â€” are restricted to immigrants with a "qualified" status, such as refugees and asylees, most of whom must wait five years before enrolling.</p>
<p>Subsidized ACA Marketplace coverage is available to these qualified immigrants as well as others, including those with Temporary Protected Status or certain work visas, while Medicaid eligibility is limited to lawfully present immigrants who meet age and work requirements, according to KFF. The Center for Children &amp; Families at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University has also fact-checked the claim and come to a similar conclusion.</p> <p>By contrast, some states provide fully-state-funded medical care for some undocumented individuals, but even those programs are being rolled back. Beginning next year in California, for example, undocumented adults will no longer be able to enroll in that state's Medi-Cal program, although children will still be covered regardless of their immigration status.</p>
<p>Gruber, who has worked on health and health care coverage policy for several decades, says the shutdown "isn't about undocumented immigrants getting health care. It's about cutting health insurance" for millions of low-income Americans.</p> <p>The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the federal spending on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP â€” another priority for Democrats â€” will be reduced by more than $1 trillion over the next decade as a result of provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill.</p> <p>Ku, of George Washington University, says part of the confusion is over the definition of who is and who isn't undocumented. "Sometimes when Republicans use the phrase 'illegal immigrant,' they include people who actually have legal status â€” like asylees, refugees, or those with Temporary Protected Status â€” just because they don't like them."</p> <p>Although Emergency Medicaid does technically cover undocumented people, it serves mainly as a backstop for hospitals, who are required by law to treat patients turning up in emergency rooms, regardless of their immigration status. "Medicaid just helps hospitals cover those costs," Ku says.</p> <p>"Emergency Medicaid is one or two billion dollars out of a trillion-dollar program. It's a tiny fraction," he adds. "This is a tail-wagging-the-dog problem. These issues are a minuscule part of Medicaid and ACA spending, but they're being blown up into something they're not."</p>
<p>Gruber says health care is a complicated issue and "the more complicated the issue, the easier it is to make a misleading claim."</p> <p>An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll published earlier this week found that 38% of Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown, 27% blame Democrats, and 31% believe both parties are to blame.</p> <p>He says that for Republicans, claiming the shutdown is about extending health care to undocumented individuals "sounds good, it feels good, and it plays into the idea that people who 'don't look like they belong here' are getting benefits. But it's just not true."</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>After nearly two decades, the classic kids' show <em>Reading Rainbow</em> is back â€” with a new host and a new digital format, but with the same mission of encouraging children to "take a look, it's in a book."</p> <p>The original show, which ran for 26 years on PBS with host LeVar Burton, won more than 250 awards, including 26 Emmys and a Peabody Award. It spurred a love of reading for generations of kids.</p> <p>The new host is library evangelist Mychal Threets, who became a social media star while working as a librarian in Solano County, Calif. (His tattoos include PBS cartoon aardvark Arthur Read's library card.)</p>
<p>In an Instagram post, Threets wrote: "I was raised on Reading Rainbow, LeVar Burton is my hero. I am a reader, I am a librarian because LeVar Burton and <em>Reading Rainbow</em> so powerfully made us believe we belong in books, we belong everywhere."</p>
<p>Buffalo Toronto Public Media, which co-created the original series in 1983, co-produced the new season, which will run for four episodes. In a bid to appeal to the media consumption habits of today's kids, the show will be available via YouTube. The first episode in the season will drop this Saturday on Kidzuko, a YouTube channel owned by Sony Pictures.</p> <p>A second season of the series hasn't yet been confirmed, but a representative for Buffalo Toronto Public Media says they have high hopes.</p> <p>Former host Burton has tried to reboot <em>Reading Rainbow</em> himself in the past â€” but became ensnared in legal challenges with the local PBS station within Buffalo Toronto Public Media.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump tells Israel to stop bombing Gaza after Hamas agrees to release Israeli hostages</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>President Trump is telling Israel it "must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza" so that Hamas can follow through on its promise to release the remaining Israeli hostages. </p> <p>Hamas said it would release all Israeli hostages in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, as set out in Trump's 20-point plan this week to end the war in Gaza.</p> <p>In a statement the Palestinian militant group said, "The movement announces its agreement to release all Israeli prisoners, both living and dead, according to the exchange formula contained in President Trump's proposal, provided the field conditions for the exchange are met." It said that other parts of the Trump proposal "require further consultations among Palestinians." </p>
<p>Trump then called for Israel to stop its bombing campaign in a post on Truth Social.</p> <p>"Based on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE," Trump wrote. "Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now, it's far too dangerous to do that. We are already in discussions on details to be worked out. This is not about Gaza alone, this is about long sought PEACE in the Middle East."</p>
<p>The plan unveiled earlier this week called for a ceasefire if Hamas agreed to release all 48 hostages it still held following its attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, with Hamas handing over the captives â€” around 20 of who are believed to still be alive â€” within 72 hours.</p> <p>In a post to Truth Social on Friday morning, Trump said he was giving Hamas a "last chance," or Hamas fighters would be "quickly extinguished." He said they would have until 6 p.m. ET on Sunday to reply to the plan, which Israel had already said it agrees to. </p> <p>"If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas," Trump wrote.</p>
<p>The White House released its 20-point plan on Monday as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Trump. The plan would immediately end Israel's war in Gaza and provide more aid to Gaza in addition to requiring the release of the hostages.</p> <p>It was unclear whether Israel would accept Hamas' partial acceptance of the agreement, as Trump had.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Israel ordered Palestinians in Gaza to leave Gaza City and move south. Those who stay, the defense ministry said, would be considered a militant or "supporter of terror."</p> <p>The United Nations agency coordinating humanitarian efforts in the region said this week it had "received reports of intense strikes in recent days in parts of Deir al Balah, one of the places where people have been told to move. Tents, houses and even a crowded market have been hit, with the UN Human Rights Office reporting that many of those killed appear to be civilians."</p> <p>The U.N. said that displacement sites in Deir al Balah and Khan Younis are currently hosting more than half a million people. On Friday it called the peace plan a "window of opportunity" for aid to come back in and for hostages to be released. </p>
