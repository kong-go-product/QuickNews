<div class="article-title">From demanding indictments to demolishing the East Wing, Trump is a TV producer</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The thing to understand about Donald Trump is that he thinks like a programmer.</p><p>That’s hardly surprising, given his "Apprentice" background. But it also means he’ll sometimes step on his own story.</p><p>If it’s a Friday and he hasn’t made big news for a couple of days, I know he’ll be feeding the press something that provides fodder for the weekend shows. He knows how to fill that void, especially with the Democrats essentially leaderless.</p><p>When the president was basking in world acclaim for brokering a seemingly impossible cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, he’d post something wild on Truth Social that would usher in another mini-news cycle.</p><p>Trust me, having interviewed him many times, he knows all about lighting and camera angles, and has definite preferences, such as using an overhead boom mike as opposed to the standard lapel mike. He once complained to the crew that his skin looked too orange.</p><p>He continues to throw out the unproven claim that the 2020 election was stolen, rejected by his own Justice Department. He won the 2024 election pretty easily, and then came the campaign of retribution, installing an inexperienced loyalist to do what no one else would, bring criminal charges against James Comey and Letitia James. And he attacks Joe Biden, now battling cancer, in almost every speech.</p><p>And he does this out in the open. Here’s a typical posting:</p><p>"Documents show conclusively that Christopher Wray, Deranged Jack Smith, Merrick Garland, Lisa Monaco, and other crooked lowlifes from the failed Biden Administration, signed off on Operation Arctic Frost. They spied on Senators and Congressmen/women, and even taped their calls. They cheated and rigged the 2020 Presidential Election. These Radical Left Lunatics should be prosecuted for their illegal and highly unethical behavior!"</p><p>By the way, I don’t believe that Trump will seek a third term, when he’d be 86 at the end of another term. It’s also flatly prohibited by the Constitution.</p><p>By refusing to rule it out, he’s basically trolling people. What if he uses this or that maneuver, as promoted by Steve Bannon? Also, no president wants to be seen as a premature lame duck.</p><p>Trump tells you exactly what he’s going to do. He said he would slash programs favored by the Democrats during the government shutdown, and he’s doing just that. This is either transparency (to his supporters) or authoritarianism (to his detractors).</p><p>It’s no coincidence that the administration announced that the SNAP program, reaching 42 million Americans on what is commonly called food stamps, would no longer be funded as of this Saturday.</p><p>Trump is also easily triggered. He broke off trade talks with Canada over an Ontario ad that he called fake AI – an odd stance for a guy who pictured himself as a fighter pilot dropping poop on protestors. Besides, the ad accurately quoted Ronald Reagan’s anti-tariff comments in a radio address, though out of order.</p><p>When things calm down, I’m sure Trump will patch it up with what he still wants to make the 51st state.</p><p>In the past week, Trump has done two things that have drawn opposition from some of his traditional allies.</p><p>He demanded $630 million from his own compliant Justice Department for his suffering through all the past investigations that led to four indictments against him. Ben Shapiro, the conservative author and podcaster, said this was an egregious conflict of interest and Trump should drop the idea. If you’ve lost Ben Shapiro, the Daily Wire founder, that is a bellwether.</p><p>The second was the demolition of the East Wing. The footage of the wreckage of that piece of history is constantly replayed on television.</p><p>Trump was being untruthful when he said his plans for what’s now, with cost overruns, a $350-million ballroom would not touch the East Wing, which dates to 1902. Then he moved quickly and stealthily to demolish the entire building. The wreckage is the story. You don’t need a panel of lawyers to explain it. Trump did exactly the opposite of what he promised. It’s still hard to look at.</p><p>The president’s trip to Asia may provide fresh headlines as he meets with China’s Xi Jinping. If not, he’ll find other ways to make news.</p><p>That’s the thing about Trump. He makes good use of the massive megaphone provided by the White House. He programs every day, flooding the zone with so many story lines that it’s hard for even journalists and politicos who track him for a living to keep up.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump says China will work with him to stop fentanyl trafficking</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>During the final leg of his Asia trip en route to South Korea, President Donald Trump spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One, expressing confidence in his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their meeting at an economic summit. </p><p>When asked about U.S. efforts to curb fentanyl trafficking, Trump said the issue would be central to his discussions with Xi.</p><p>Ahead of his meeting with the Chinese leader, Trump said he hoped for progress on "a lot of problems," including fentanyl trafficking, trade and tariffs.</p><p>"China is going to be working with me, okay," Trump told reporters. "They’re going to be working with me, and we’re going to do something, I believe."</p><p>Trump said the issue would be a major topic of discussion in his upcoming meeting. </p><p>"We have to have the meeting — a meeting tomorrow. That’s a big meeting," he said. "And fentanyl will be one of the things that we’re discussing. The farmers will be discussing a lot of things, but fentanyl will be one of the things we discuss."</p><p>Trump stated that the fentanyl crisis and drug trafficking across the southern border are directly related, calling them "tremendous amounts of death."</p><p>"We took in tremendous amounts of death. I call them the boats of death," he said. "Under Biden and open borders, stuff was flowing. I think they killed 300,000 people last year — fentanyl drugs coming through the southern border. And now nobody gets through this. We’re very tough on the border."</p><p>Trump credited his policies with a sharp reduction in illegal drug trafficking by sea, saying it was "down about 80% by water."</p><p>He also praised U.S. law enforcement and border officials for their efforts, saying, "Our border agents, our Border Patrol agents, they’ve been amazing. ICE — these people do such a great job with what they’re doing."</p><p>During his visit, Trump also commented on international security issues, including the Israel-Hamas conflict and North Korea’s recent missile launches. He said he expects his meeting with Xi to be productive, adding, "I think we’ll get a great meeting with President Xi of China. And a lot of problems are going to be solved."</p><p>Trump’s comments underscored his push to link border security and international cooperation as key priorities ahead of his meeting with Xi.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump says he could deploy US military in American cities, claims ‘courts wouldn’t get involved’</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump spoke to the press while en route to South Korea on Tuesday aboard Air Force One and made remarks about his authority to deploy U.S. military forces domestically — something that will likely draw legal and political concerns.</p><p>Trump was traveling to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), where he is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p><p>During the media availability, Trump claimed he could deploy U.S. military forces into American cities if necessary, claiming that "the courts wouldn’t get involved."</p><p>When speaking with reporters, he said he would consider using the military beyond the National Guard if the need arises.</p><p>"I would do that if it was necessary," he said. "It hasn’t been necessary. We’re doing a great job without that."</p><p>Trump also argued that, as president, he has the power to take such an action.</p><p>"If I want to enact a certain act, I’m allowed to do it routinely," he said. "I’d be allowed to do whatever I want… You understand that the courts wouldn’t get involved. Nobody would get involved."</p><p>He added, "I could send the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. I can send anybody I wanted, but I haven’t done that because we’re doing so well."</p><p>Trump made it a point to use San Francisco as an example, describing how federal officials were "all set to go last Saturday" to intervene in the city but held off after local leaders asked for a chance to handle it themselves.</p><p>"We would have solved that problem in less than a month," he said, adding that federal intervention "would go a lot quicker and it’s much more effective."</p><p>He also emphasized what he described as progress in other parts of the U.S.</p><p>"Memphis is making tremendous progress," Trump said. "It’s down, I think, almost 70%, 60–70%. And within two or three weeks it would be down to almost no crime."</p><p>The president is scheduled to meet with Xi on Wednesday to discuss fentanyl trafficking, trade policy and border security.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The best-of-seven World Series is all even at two games apiece.</p><p>The Toronto Blue Jays recovered from Monday’s epic 18-inning marathon to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-2 in Game 4 on Tuesday night. Both teams were running on fumes after the near seven-hour showdown, but Toronto's offense came alive behind Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette. </p><p>A sacrifice fly from Enrique Hernández gave the Dodgers an early lead, but Guerrero Jr.'s two-run homer in the third inning put Toronto ahead for good. </p><p>The Blue Jays bounced back just hours after country music star Brad Paisley declared himself "Mr. More Baseball."

<div class="article-title">Texas honeymooners trapped in Jamaica as Category 5 Hurricane Melissa slams island</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>What began as a dream honeymoon has turned into a terrifying ordeal for Texas newlyweds Kasydee and Hunter Bishop, who are stranded in Jamaica as Category 5 storm Hurricane Melissa barrels toward the island, according to Fox 4 Dallas-Fort Worth.</p><p>Melissa is forecast to become the strongest hurricane in Jamaica’s history with sustained winds of 175 mph. Officials are warning of life-threatening flash flooding, landslides and widespread damage to nearby regions. Residents and visitors alike are being urged to take emergency precautions as the storm approaches.</p><p>The Bishops, who are staying in Montego Bay on the island’s northwest coast, arrived just before evacuation orders were issued, Fox 4 reported. Since then, the airport has been boarded up and all outgoing flights canceled, leaving many tourists stranded as the hurricane bears down, the station added.</p><p>"All we are hearing is how intense the storm is going to be, and we just really have no idea what to expect right now," Hunter said, according to the local station.</p><p>Kasydee added that she had been praying for the hurricane to not disrupt the airport and keep them from returning home. However, the couple has since moved to a shelter as the storm moves across the country.</p><p>"We feel pretty safe here at least!!" she said in a post on TikTok Monday, adding that she feels very blessed to have a place to stay. "Just praying non stop for the protection of and and everyone here!!!"</p><p>As Melissa pushes northeast, Cuba and surrounding nations are bracing for heavy rain, flooding, storm surges and damaging winds. Areas outside the storm’s direct path are also expected to experience severe weather.</p><p>The last time Jamaica faced a hurricane of a similar magnitude was Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, a Category 4 storm remembered as the deadliest and most destructive in the nation’s history. The storm left hundreds homeless and forced thousands into overcrowded emergency shelters, according to a report from the National Library of Jamaica. Despite its ferocity, the official death toll remained relatively low with 45 fatalities and few reported injuries, but the storm caused an estimated $800 million in damage across the island, the publication said.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Newsom invokes Scripture in attack on GOP over shutdown affecting food assistance: ‘Cruelty is the policy’</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom invoked biblical teachings while criticizing Republican leadership and the Trump administration for the federal government shutdown’s impact on food assistance, arguing that Scripture commands care for the hungry and that Washington is failing that moral test.</p><p>Speaking Tuesday in Sacramento alongside state Attorney General Rob Bonta and Health and Human Services Secretary Kim Johnson, Newsom cited teachings from Matthew, Isaiah, Luke and Proverbs as evidence that feeding the poor is "core and central to what it is to align to God’s will."</p><p>"It’s not a suggestion in the Old [and] the New Testament," Newsom said. "These guys need to stop the B.S. in Washington. They’re sitting there in their prayer breakfasts. Maybe they got an edited version of [President] Donald Trump’s Bible, and they edited all of that out. Cruelty is the policy."</p><p>Newsom, who was raised Catholic and graduated from Santa Clara University, a Jesuit institution, has occasionally cited his faith background and Jesuit education when discussing social issues. </p><p>In his remarks Tuesday, he referenced "a wonderful Jesuit university" and said lessons from the New Testament emphasize feeding the hungry and caring for the poor.</p><p>Newsom’s comments came as California and two dozen other states sued the Trump administration's U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) over its decision to suspend November Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits during the government shutdown. </p><p>Bonta said the agency has contingency funds and is allegedly "unlawfully withholding payments." </p><p>While Newsom tied the issue to Scripture, he recently came under fire for pushing against White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt's assertion of the power of prayer in the wake of the Annunciation Catholic Church shooting in August.</p><p>"These children were literally praying as they got shot at," Newsom wrote above a clip of Leavitt promoting prayer.</p><p>Newsom pressed the point repeatedly in his Tuesday remarks, saying leaders who cite religion should reflect those values in policy. </p><p>"We’re going to win this lawsuit," he said. "It’s about serving those that are hungry."</p><p>California officials said the state has accelerated $80 million to food banks and deployed volunteers and National Guard members to move supplies. Johnson said CalFresh serves 5.5 million residents monthly and warned that a lapse in SNAP benefits would increase poverty.</p><p>Newsom closed his remarks by again linking government action to biblical duty. "It’s around food. It’s about serving those that are hungry," he said.</p><p>White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson pushed back sharply, accusing the governor of hypocrisy.</p><p>"It’s preposterous that Newsom, who shuttered churches during COVID and recently derided the power of prayer, is now attempting to manipulate religion to fit his own political agenda," Jackson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. </p><p>"President Trump wants the government open — the Democrats’ insistence on keeping it shut down is hurting the American people, but they could prevent these harms by simply reopening the government. Instead of distorting religion for political means, Newsom should urge his fellow Democrats to reopen the government."</p><p>On Fox News' "America Reports" Tuesday, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins blamed Democrats for refusing to vote on measures to reopen the government and restore SNAP funding.</p><p>"We are right at the cliff. And I’ve been warning about this for almost a month now, that we have enough money to get us through the end of October. But after that, the government has to reopen," Rollins said.</p><p>The USDA and Newsom’s office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s requests for comment.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Madison Colombo contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Pentagon has pulled key protections for its civilian workers and instructed managers to move with "speed and conviction" to fire underperforming workers, according to a memo issued last month.</p><p>The guidelines were issued on Sept. 30, just one day before the government shutdown, in a memo titled "Separation of Employees with Unacceptable Performance" to eliminate workers with "unacceptable" performance reviews.</p><p>"Supervisors and human resources (HR) professionals are directed to act with speed and conviction to facilitate the separation from Federal service of employees performing unsuccessfully," reads the memo signed by Under Secretary of Defense Anthony Tata, the Pentagon’s top personnel policy officer.</p><p>The memo also states that managers will be held accountable for not addressing "poor employee performance."</p><p>Some managers fear that the guidelines are too broad to where they could be used to fire anyone who does not support the Trump administration’s programs, according to The Washington Post.</p><p>It is unclear how many employees have been fired since the memo was issued last month.</p><p>"The Department is in the process of adapting to the new guidance outlined in Under Secretary of War Tata’s memo from September 30th and we have nothing specific to share at this time," the Pentagon said in a statement to The Washington Post.</p><p>Nearly half of the Defense civilian workforce have been furloughed during the ongoing shutdown. The administration attempted to fire thousands of furloughed employees earlier this month, but the effort was blocked by a federal court.</p><p>The civilian firings are part of a larger effort by Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth to eliminate the "debris" he purports is standing in the way of his mission to carry out Trump's agenda.</p><p>"The sooner we have the right people, the sooner we can advance the right policies. Personnel is policy," Hegseth said last month during a speech at Marine Corps Base Quantico.</p><p>The memo makes it easier for managers to fire Defense civilian workers, creating additional subjectivity for job performance evaluations.</p><p>Managers are directed to cite criteria used in federal job evaluations known as Douglas Factors, but each factor in the new memo added language that could impact some of those considerations.</p><p>"Every DoW position supports the mission, so deficiencies in any role can warrant strong action," the memo reads under the Douglas Factor section that involves an employee’s roles and responsibilities.</p><p>The factors allow managers "flexibility to address performance issues swiftly and effectively," according to the memo.</p><p>"This approach empowers supervisors to act decisively when performance undermines DoW’s objectives, reinforcing a culture of excellence. Supervisors are to use the Douglas Factors in consideration of their action," the memo added.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Nanny found with suspected psychedelic mushrooms accused of fatal stabbing, screwdriver attack on family</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A 35-year-old nanny was charged with murder and denied bond after authorities say she fatally stabbed an elderly grandfather multiple times while she was caring for a 3-year-old inside a Michigan home over the weekend.</p><p>Samantha Rae Booth appeared to have a "manic" episode when the child’s grandfather came by for a welfare check, Royal Oak police said. </p><p>Officials said Booth not only killed the 83-year-old man but also fled from responding police, attacked another family member with a screwdriver, stripped naked and was found with suspected psychedelic mushrooms and marijuana in her purse, FOX 11 Los Angeles reported.</p><p>Booth was charged with first-degree murder, second-degree child abuse, assault and three counts of resisting, assaulting or obstructing police. The child abuse charge stems from the fact that the alleged murder happened in front of a child, the judge said, according to the station.</p><p>According to police, the horrific incident began when the child’s mother, who was out of town on Friday, asked her father to check on her daughter as she was being cared for by the nanny. When she did not receive an update, the mother sent the child’s uncle to the home. </p><p>Police said that when the uncle entered the home, he heard noises coming from the basement. Upon going downstairs, he found the nanny in a "manic" state covered in blood, and the child's grandfather, David Ong, lying on the floor with severe injuries. Ong received emergency medical care but ultimately succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene, officials said.</p><p>The uncle then grabbed the child, who was also in the basement, and tried to escape. He repeatedly fended off attacks from the nanny as he made his way out of the home, police said. </p><p>Booth allegedly followed them with a screwdriver, but the uncle and child eventually took shelter in a nearby home until police arrived.</p><p>Officials said Booth allegedly stopped chasing the uncle, dropped the screwdriver and stripped off her clothes before fleeing from responding police. She was reportedly found with blood on her hands and detained after a brief foot pursuit. Although she initially tried to escape, police said she was quickly apprehended.</p><p>The child and uncle sustained minor injuries and were taken to Corewell Hospital for evaluation, where they were treated and released shortly afterward, police said.</p><p>Authorities said Booth had looked after the child for two years previously without incident, according to FOX 11 Los Angeles.</p><p>"We extend our deepest condolences to the victim’s family as they cope with this tragic and senseless act of violence. No family should ever have to endure such loss, and we are keeping them in our thoughts," Royal Oak Police Chief Michael Moore said in a statement.</p><p>Ong’s daughter, Kelley, shared a statement in a post on Facebook Sunday: "My father, David Ong, died tragically on Friday evening while protecting his cherished 3 year old granddaughter. The loss is immeasurable. Anyone who knows my dad knows that he is a gentle giant - a man of incredible kindness, love and faith. I’ve often said he is simply the best man I know."</p><p>"He was a hero on Friday, but to me, he’s always been my hero."</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>German activist Naomi Seibt, dubbed the "Anti-Greta" by Europeans, has filed for political asylum in the U.S., claiming she’s being persecuted in her native country for her political views and advocacy of free speech.</p><p>Seibt, 25, submitted her petition under Section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, stating that returning to Germany would expose her to imprisonment or physical harm.</p><p>"I have now applied for asylum, which means that I’m waiting for an interview. And, in the meantime, I’m here legally," Seibt told Fox News Digital.</p><p>"My goal in the meantime is to become an American citizen in the future because this country has given me so much hope," she added, claiming her activism efforts caught Elon Musk's attention.</p><p>"I made a post during the European elections in June 2024, where I said, my name is Naomi Seibt, and I'm voting for the AfD and that was the very first time that Musk interacted with me. Elon privately messaged me on x about the AfD."</p><p>The move arrives amid a policy shift under President Donald Trump’s refugee and asylum agenda, which is to prioritize applicants facing persecution on grounds of political speech and opposition to government censorship.</p><p>Under that mandate, certain Europeans claiming they are at risk for expressing dissenting opinions, especially on free speech grounds, could be eligible for expedited review.</p><p>Seibt’s filing positions her as one of the first to invoke that framework. She claims to fear detention or worse if she returns to Germany, where she says she has been surveilled, threatened and left unprotected by state authorities "for years."</p><p>"In 2024, I found out that I had been spied on by German intelligence for years. Simultaneously, I keep receiving death threats from Antifa," she said.</p><p>"I went to the German police, and they told me that they can’t do anything about it as long as I have not actually been raped or killed.</p><p>"I am not getting protection from the German government even though I am at major risk of potentially being killed."</p><p>Seibt has begun positioning herself as a free speech martyr.</p><p>"It is illegal to damage the reputation of a politician in Germany. This law was extended under Angela Merkel article 188 and now people are being arrested. And their houses are being raided for just social media posts. As soon as I come back to Germany, I feel that they will try to arrest me."</p><p>Her activism first attracted attention when she questioned climate change orthodoxy and mass migration policies, and she was branded the "Anti-Greta" as a foil to Greta Thunberg.</p><p>"I had started becoming known and internationally recognized as the anti-Greta Thunberg in 2020," she added.</p><p>"I was barely 19 years old and never expected to be recognized as a right-wing figure. The German media called me the anti-Greta, they demonize me as the anti-Greta, like an anti-Christ for Greta Thunberg.</p><p>"I’m Naomi Seibt and want to be recognized as who I am because I’m not just some puppet poster figure for the right wing."</p><p>Seibt cites close ties to billionaire Tesla founder Musk and claims he is aware of the danger in Europe, offering her support.</p><p>"Over the course of last year, I was obviously retweeted a lot by Elon Musk, and I interacted with him personally in private messages just about what’s going on in Germany," she explained.</p><p>"Elon has been terrified to go to Europe and knows that there is an extremely high threat and has confirmed this to me personally. That’s when I made the decision to apply for asylum myself. He gave me his approval for that."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">'Anarchists illegally took them down,' and now Portland is putting statues of Lincoln and Roosevelt back up</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt statues will be reinstated in Portland’s South Park Blocks after a public engagement process determined the landmarks should return.</p><p>The monuments, toppled five years ago this month during the "Indigenous Peoples Day of Rage" protests, will return following a series of public sessions where attendees expressed differing reasons for bringing them back.</p><p>The City of Roses reported that many residents were especially concerned about reinstalling Lincoln’s monument. One participant said they wanted the statues "back up because anarchists illegally took them down."</p><p>Another resident opposed the "erasure of monuments," urging an "elevated conversation" about how the landmarks can be "contextualized for today’s audience and into the future."</p><p>Recontextualization of the history written on the statues continued to be a common theme, while others shared the idea that the tributes "may be better in other communities." </p><p>The report also cited "unsanctioned vandalism" of the statues, with one Portland resident stating that a "mob of young, White anarchists should not dictate city policies," while advocating for the city to vote on each removed statue publicly. </p><p>Another respondent agreed, saying the crowd that tore down the monuments "does not represent Portland."</p><p>Another participant said, "Portland is a young city, we should preserve the limited past we have… damaged monuments should be repaired and reinstalled ASAP… criminal destruction of public monuments [and] art should not be an impetus for their reunion." </p><p>The voters on this matter reportedly fell into two different groups: one advocating for updated context for each statue, while the other was focused on reestablishing the historical monuments. </p><p>Deb Elliott, a professor at Portland State University’s Regional Research Institute, told The Oregonian that one group of people wanted the monuments updated with a "complete narrative around the impact of the historical figure," while others "just wanted the monuments put back." </p><p>Lincoln's statue is expected to be reinstalled in early 2026, with Roosevelt’s following about a year later.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Mamdani forced to address unearthed video exposing vile NYPD comparison</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A controversial comparison between law enforcement and the Israeli military (IDF) is landing New York City socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in hot water after the unearthed clip from a 2023 socialist conference went viral on social media.</p><p>"We have to make clear that when the boot of the NYPD is on your neck, it’s been laced by the IDF," Mamdani, who was a keynote speaker, said while speaking on a panel during the Democratic Socialists of America's 2023 national convention.</p><p>The comments add fuel for critics who have criticized Mamdani's past statements and opinions about law enforcement. Mamdani was compelled to go on Fox News and apologize amid backlash over past comments in which he said the NYPD should be defunded and is "racist, anti-queer and a major threat to public safety."</p><p>"Sorry, I just wanted to – before we get to the next questions – I just wanted to address a couple of the questions," Mamdani said during the 2023 DSA conference panel as he teed up his analogy about the NYPD and IDF. "In the first question there was this setting up of a context where this idea of hyper-local and international – and I think that for anyone to care about these issues we have to make them hyper-local, we have to make clear that when the boot of the NYPD is on your neck it's been laced by the IDF."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the Mamdani campaign for comment on this story, but did not receive a response. However, he did address the matter during a press gaggle in Hell's Kitchen Tuesday night.</p><p>"You know, I've said time and again that with public safety, I'm looking forward to working with police officers here in New York City to deliver it," Mamdani said during a Tuesday event in Hell's Kitchen after video of his remarks began circulating. "I'm looking forward to ensuring that we actually tackle the retention crisis at hand, where we now have about 350 officers leaving the department every month. And that is something we will bring to an end by ensuring that police officers are only asked to do the work of a police department, not the work of social services, as they have."</p><p>Meanwhile, Mamdani was also asked about his opinion on keeping the NYPD's liaison office open in Israel, to which Mamdani responded that his "focus" was on the NYPD in New York, not overseas.</p><p>Social media erupted after the clip was posted on X with several prominent accounts on both sides of the aisle slamming Mamdani.</p><p>"This guy is truly awful," Outkick.com founder Clay Travis posted on X.</p><p>"People are rightly pointing out that this is textbook antisemitism (all your problems are caused by Jews!), but my question is, when Mamdani issued his blanket apology to the NYPD, did that apology extend to the people who laced their boots?! Inquiring minds want to know!" NewsNation Host Batya Ungar-Sargon posted on X.</p><p>"There is a word for this kind of twisted fear mongering and conspiratorial thinking: antisemitism," Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt posted on X.</p><p>"Sick. Zohran Mamdani smeared Israel and the NYPD in one breath, claiming the 'boot on your neck is laced by the IDF," Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., posted on X. "This is antisemitic, divisive, &amp; dangerous."</p><p>In addition to Mamdani's past remarks about law enforcement, his proposed plans on how to approach policing if elected mayor have also raised concern for some.</p><p>For example, Mamdani has been criticized for proposing that social workers and other non-police professionals like "transit ambassadors" should handle certain 911 calls, which Mamdani has said would serve to ease NYPD workloads and improve officer retention. The proposal is something Mamdani has championed as far back as 2020.</p><p>Meanwhile, during a mayoral debate earlier this month, Mamdani added that he wants to reorganize the NYPD and "trust" 911 dispatchers to "make the determination on whether there was any indication of violence" and that law enforcement is necessary to respond.</p><p>Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and adjunct professor of criminal justice at Penn State Lehigh Valley, called Mamdani's plan "the worst idea" he's heard in a while.  </p><p>"I don’t have a clue what he’s talking about and neither does he," Giacalone said. "My question is, what happens when the dispatcher is wrong and someone dies? Is it an oops? The liability the city would be taking on with this idea will be off the charts."</p><p>Former New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, called Mamdani "divisive across the board" and slammed his opponent in the New York City mayoral race for "call[ing] the NYPD racist." </p><p>"You can't be a divisive leader in this city. You have to be united," Cuomo added at a campaign event. "Because all day long in this city people are bumping into each other and one of the main responsibilities you learn inherently as a governor, a mayor or an executive, is that you have to constantly be working to keep people together because they will separate and fight naturally. You're the force that's pulling them together."</p></body></div></body></html>

Jones’ cameo drew rave reviews from the star of the show, actor and musician Billy Bob Thorton.</p><p>The episode featuring Jones became available for streaming in January. Jones portrayed himself, delivering some emotional dialogue about family.</p><p>"Now, I’m not saying I’ve done anything right, but I made my mind up a long time ago I was gonna work with my kids," Jones said on the show, as transcribed by USA Today. </p><p>"And they’re involved in everything. They’re involved in my leasing, oil and gas, real estate. And, so, when I got the Cowboys, I got it so that we could all work together. I thought I was doing it for them, but the one that got the most out of it was me."</p><p>Thornton appeared on Monday's "Manningcast" and applauded Jones' acting skills.</p><p>"I was not surprised because he was telling his own story," the Academy Award winner said. "I mean, if it had been scripted in a way where he had to say every line, it might have been different. But he was actually telling the story of his life. If you just ask somebody, sit down and tell it — he got teared up. I mean, he was very, very good. If you can get a non-actor to be themselves, they’re better than actors."</p><p>On the football field, Jones' Cowboys lost 44-24 to the Denver Broncos Sunday.

"Could you imagine? These are the most independent people in the world. You guys don't want to ask anybody for any help.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Florida on Tuesday carried out its 15th execution of the year — a record under Gov. Ron DeSantis — putting to death Norman Mearle Grim Jr., who was convicted of raping and murdering his neighbor more than two decades ago.</p><p>A spokesperson for DeSantis confirmed 65-year-old Grim was pronounced dead at 6:14 p.m. after receiving a three-drug injection at the Florida State Prison near Starke, according to The Associated Press.</p><p>The spokesperson, Alex Lanfranconi, noted that Grim was asked if he had a final statement before receiving the injection, and he replied, "No sir."</p><p>Lanfranconi also said there were no complications during the execution.</p><p>Grim was sentenced to death after being convicted of sexual battery and first-degree murder in the death of Cynthia Campbell. The victim was reported missing in July 1998 and her body, which was battered, was found by a fisherman in the water near the Pensacola Bay Bridge.</p><p>Prosecutors made the case that Campbell suffered multiple blunt-force injuries to her face and head, consistent with those of being struck by a hammer.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Anthony Hopkins' olive branch to reconnect with his estranged daughter was denied more than 20 years ago.</p><p>The Academy Award-winning actor said he won't waste his life living with resentment over the fact that his only child, Abigail Hopkins, chooses not to have a relationship with him.</p><p>When asked his thoughts on reconciliation between estranged parents and children, Hopkins told "The Interview" he's moved on from reconnecting with his daughter after she denied a request to meet.</p><p>"My wife, Stella, sent an invitation to come and see us," Hopkins said. "Not a word of response, so I think, ‘OK, fine. I wish her well,' but I'm not going to waste blood over that.</p><p>"If you want to waste your life being in resentment — 50 years later, 58 years later — fine, go ahead. That's not in my camp.</p><p>"See, I could carry resentment over the past this and the other, but that's death. You're not living. You have to acknowledge one thing, that we are imperfect. We're not saints.</p><p>"We're all sinners and saints or whatever we are. We do the best we can. Life is painful. Sometimes people get hurt. Sometimes we get hurt. But you can't live like that. You have to say, ‘Get over it.’ If you can't get over it, fine. Good luck to you. But I have no judgment. I did what I could, so that's it." </p><p>When asked if Hopkins hoped his daughter would read his book, the actor said he "didn't care" and that he wanted to move on from the subject. </p><p>"I don't want to hurt her, and I don't want to make any … 20 years. The offer was made, but fine. Onwards."</p><p>Hopkins allegedly walked out of the relationship with Abigail's mother and his first wife, Petronella Barker, when Abigail was a child. The father and daughter reconnected in the '90s when he arranged for Abigail to appear in his films "Shadowlands" and "The Remains of the Day." </p><p>They've since been estranged. Hopkins previously told the Radio Times he was unaware if he was a grandfather.</p><p>"I don’t have any idea," he said in 2018. "People break up. Families split and, you know, ‘Get on with your life.’ People make choices. I don’t care one way or the other."</p><p>When he was told that his response sounded "cold," Hopkins replied, "Well, it is cold. Because life is cold."</p><p>The Emmy Award-winning star also recalled to "The Interview" the moment he decided to get sober after struggling with alcohol dependency for years. </p><p>"I was drunk, driving my car here in California in a blackout, no clue where I was going," Hopkins said. </p><p>"It was a moment when I realized that I could have killed somebody – or myself, which I didn't care about, but I could have killed a family in a car. I realized I was an alcoholic."</p><p>After finding a meeting for a 12-step program, Hopkins said he heard a "deep, powerful thought" that told him, "It's all over. Now, you can start living, and it has all been for a purpose, so don't forget one moment of it."</p><p>Almost instantly, Hopkins said, his craving for drinking just left. </p><p>"I don't know or have any theories except divinity or that power that we all possess inside us that creates us from birth — life force — whatever it is. It's a consciousness, I believe. That's all I know. My whole life has been like that," he said.</p><p>Hopkins admitted he drank "to nullify that discomfort, or whatever it was in me, because it made me feel big. You know booze is terrific because it instantly feels in a different space, and I enjoyed that."</p><p>Before getting sober, he recalled thinking to himself, "This is going to kill me. … I was drinking like it was going out of fashion."</p><p>In December, Hopkins will celebrate 50 years of sobriety.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A protest broke out after a Turning Point USA chapter had announced it was launching at a high school in a suburb of Detroit.</p><p>Residents and students of the Royal Oak High School (ROHS) community assembled to protest against the TPUSA chapter before it had its first gathering. </p><p>A student organized a "Walk Out Against Hate &amp; Violence" on October 22 "in opposition to the Turning Point USA coming to our school," a flyer promoting the protest reads.</p><p>"We will be sitting down in class and then leaving. Bring your items with you," the flyer reads.</p><p>Bruno, the president of the TPUSA chapter at ROHS, told Fox News Digital that he expected minor pushback, but not to the extent the chapter received.</p><p>"We haven't even had our first meeting. It was a flyer to get people to join and to share interest with us if they want to come. All the hate we received kind of just exploded," he said.</p><p>Jaden Bennett, one of the TPUSA Michigan high school field representatives who cover metro Detroit, said there were dozens of students that protested the chapter being formed.</p><p>"Some of these students that were protesting were questioning the principal," she added.</p><p>In addition to the protest, a student group called the Royal Oak Student Voice posted a memo blasting TPUSA for its platform, claiming it's masquerading as a civic non-profit group that in reality it's a "white supremacist" group. </p><p>"But in reality, Turning Point USA is a primary driver of white supremacist, anti-LGBTQ, pro-violence, anti-woman propaganda for young audiences. Below are quotes from its main spokesperson at Turning Point USA events. These aren’t political opinions. These are examples of Turning Point USA’s otherist and hateful views. Check their website for videos and podcasts if this isn’t enough," the student group said. </p><p>The United Students of Royal Oak drafted a "Constitution Against Hate" as well. The constitution called the school’s administration ignorant for approving the "pro-hate" chapter.</p><p>Bennett spearheaded the effort to start a TPUSA chapter at ROHS. Bennett said that Bruno and other students chartered the chapter on Oct. 15. The chapter got approved by the principal on Oct. 21.</p><p>Within the first two hours of the TPUSA chapter posting on Instagram, outrage ensued. While the chapter’s social media account had only 15 followers, the first post accumulated over 300 comments.</p><p>Many of the comments called for the group to be removed.</p><p>"Students are just like, you're hateful, you are a Nazi, oh my gosh, you're a fascist, like, Charlie hated gay people, Charlie is a racist, how could you be promoting this?" Bennett said.</p><p>Over the next 48 hours, the backlash escalated with some comments spewing death threats.</p><p>"Within like 24 pushing 48 hours... They had accumulated over 900 Instagram comments on this post. Maybe 100 were positive, you know, like supportive. A lot of them were my students and other field reps," Bennett said.</p><p>Ever since Kirk was assassinated, Bennett has received a flood of requests to start chapters. </p><p>"Before Charlie passed away, I was doing a lot of outreach through social media and just faced off like community contacts and parent connections," Bennett said.</p><p>"Ever since Charlie died, students have been reaching out – like I would say 90% of our students that are involved now are completely like they've reached out by themselves.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Reba McEntire became emotional on a recent episode of "The Voice."</p><p>During Monday night's episode of the popular competition reality show, the 70-year-old country music superstar teared up after contestant Aubrey Nicole performed "I'm Gonna Love You Through It" by Martina McBride, during the first episode of the knockout round of season 28.</p><p>After her performance, McEntire's fellow coach on the show, Snoop Dogg, told Nicole that while he didn't know the song, he was still moved by her rendition of it. He then handed McEntire a tissue as she started getting emotional, saying, "I do know this song. Martina's — I'll need it, thank you, Snoop."</p><p>"Martina’s a good friend of mine. I lost my oldest son because he did not win with cancer," McEntire said. "That was a real reminder that life goes on, and we sing songs about it so we can remember the ones around us that we love so much, that we lean on at times like this. You did a great job."</p><p>The song tells the story of a couple facing a cancer diagnosis together, with lyrics such as "Cancer don't discriminate or care if you're just 38/With three kids who need you in their lives." According to NBC News, Nicole dedicated the song to her father, who had previously battled cancer and is now in remission.</p><p>McEntire lost her stepson, Brandon Blackstock, in August, after a private battle with melanoma, a form of skin cancer. She was married to his father, her former manager Narvel Blackstock, from 1989 to 2015.</p><p>She took to Instagram shortly after his death to pay tribute to him, sharing multiple photos of the two of them.</p><p>"Last week, my stepson/oldest son Brandon Blackstock went home to be with God. His struggle is over and he is in eternal peace in God’s presence," she wrote in the caption. "There is no one else like him, and I’m thankful for the time we had together. His legacy and laughter will be carried on through his family. Rest in peace cowboy. Happy trails to you til we meet again."</p><p>In addition to Brandon, McEntire is also stepmother to Narvel's daughters Chassidy and Shawna, whom he shares with his ex-wife, Elisa Gayle Ritter. She and Narvel also share their son, Shelby.</p><p>Although she and Narvel separated in 2015, McEntire has continued to look at his children from the previous relationship as her own.</p><p>"I absolutely loved that child. He came into my life, I guess he was four years old. Then when Narvel and I got married, he was 13, 14," she told People in October. "Along with his mom and dad, I helped raise him, along with [stepkids] Shawna and Chassidy. They were my kids."</p><p>She went on to share that he was "so funny" and that "he loved to scare people," adding that "his mischievousness and his love of life" will be missed and that "we'll never forget him."</p><p>Brandon was married to singer Kelly Clarkson for seven years, from 2013 to 2020, and they share two children: River, 11, and Remington, 9.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A former Army sergeant who once held top secret clearance at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state was sentenced Tuesday to four years in federal prison for attempting to provide national defense information to China.</p><p>Joseph Daniel Schmidt, 31, pleaded guilty in June to attempting to deliver and retain classified material, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ). U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour also ordered three years of supervised release.</p><p>Schmidt's sentencing comes as U.S. authorities warn of growing efforts by China to recruit or exploit former military personnel with access to sensitive information.</p><p>"As a retired Army officer, I find it unconscionable for a former soldier to put his colleagues and country at risk by peddling secret information and intelligence access to a hostile foreign power," Acting U.S. Attorney Charles Neil Floyd said.</p><p>Schmidt enlisted in 2015 and served in the Army’s 109th Military Intelligence Battalion until 2020. Prosecutors said he had access to both secret and top secret systems and later contacted Chinese consular officials after leaving the Army.</p><p>Court records show Schmidt created multiple documents based on classified material and offered them to Chinese security services. He also kept a device capable of accessing secure Army networks, which prosecutors said he offered to Chinese officials.</p><p>After leaving the Army, Schmidt traveled to Hong Kong in March 2020 and continued corresponding with Chinese contacts. He lived there for more than three years before flying to San Francisco in October 2023, where he was arrested. He pleaded guilty in June 2025 and was sentenced Tuesday in Seattle.</p><p>Coughenour said he weighed "the seriousness of Schmidt’s crime and his mental health at the time." A DOJ spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital the judge considered Schmidt’s mental health as a mitigating factor during sentencing. </p><p>The agency said Schmidt’s separation from the Army followed a mental health episode, and officials added that no classified material was believed to have reached China.</p><p>"The FBI and our partners will remain vigilant in our mission to safeguard our nation," said W.

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A group of social justice rabbis, including a transgender rabbi who reportedly mingled with Iran's president and was kicked out of the Biden White House for hijacking the event to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, headlined an ad to get Jews for Zohran to go out and vote in the waning days before the New York City mayoral election.</p><p>Rabbi Abby Stein, who is transgender, was one of the four rabbis featured in the Jews for Zohran advertisement shared on social media by Jews for Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ), which has been accused by the leader of the Anti-Defamation League oc being "out of touch." </p><p>The other rabbis who spoke in the advertisement included Emily Cohen, Miriam Grossman and Rachel Goldenberg. </p><p>"As Jews, as rabbis, as New Yorkers, we believe that all people deserve to thrive. Zohran agrees," they say in the ad.</p><p>Stein co-authored an article in Autostraddle after a 2024 Pride Month event at the White House under former President Joe Biden in which she and another protester, a former White House staffer, described the incident where she hijacked Jill Biden's speech to yell about a ceasefire in Gaza. The pair were ultimately escorted out of the event. </p><p>Stein has also been criticized for her affiliation with Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian during the United Nations General Assembly in October 2024.

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Plus-size model Tess Holliday said this week that she was recently told to lose weight by a flight attendant, and it left her in a "state of shock."</p><p>The 40-year-old said she was flying first class on United from Tampa, Florida, with her 9-year-old son when she got up to use the airplane bathroom.</p><p>"I was in the restroom, and my hip hit the flight attendant call button," she told People magazine. "When I came out of the bathroom, the flight attendant then started to tell me that they noticed I was traveling with my child, and that losing weight would be in my best interest."</p><p>She said he continued to tell her about his sister whom he said was "very, very large, probably [Holliday’s] size," who had been discriminated against on a flight recently.</p><p>"He said that his sister needed to lose weight as well, and that the long-term effect on our bodies isn’t good for our health," she said. "This went on for about 10 minutes, and I think I was just frozen.

But, entering Week 8 against the Bengals, there were numerous reports speculating that backup quarterback Tyrod Taylor would be getting the nod against Cincinnati.</p><p>An injury to Taylor forced the Jets’ hand, and Fields was back in the driver’s seat.</p><p>The situation took a surprising turn as Fields went 21-of-32 for 244 yards and a touchdown, along with 31 yards on 11 rushes in the thrilling 39-38 win.

<div class="article-title">Hurricane Melissa on brink of Cuba landfall. Maps show its forecast path.</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Hurricane Melissa was on the brink of making landfall over Cuba early Wednesday after <span class="link">bashing Jamaica as a Category 5 storm</span>.</p><p>Melissa was one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic basin when it reached Jamaica Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>"On the forecast track," the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said early Wednesday, "the core of Melissa is expected to move over eastern Cuba through this morning, move across the southeastern or central Bahamas later today, and approach Bermuda Thursday and Thursday night."</p><p>Melissa is expected to be "an extremely dangerous major hurricane" when it gets to Cuba, according to the center.</p><p>Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major <span class="link">impacts on the mainland United States</span>, but it turned into the strongest Atlantic system this season and is tied for the second-strongest on record in terms of wind speed.</p>
<h2>Melissa's forecast and path</h2><p>The storm made landfall along Jamaica's southwestern coast at around 1 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, packing maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, the hurricane center said. Hurricanes reach Category 5 — the top of <span class="link">the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale</span> — when their winds hit 157 mph. </p><p>Melissa's winds were clocked at 130 mph Tuesday night, making it a Category 4 hurricane, the center said.</p><p>And early Wednesday, Melissa's winds were recorded at 125 mph, the center said, making it a Category 3, and it was still considered a major hurricane. The storm was traveling northeast at 10 mph.</p><p>With the NHC's latest update, Melissa was centered some 80 miles west-southwest of Guantanamo, Cuba, and about 270 miles south of the central Bahamas.</p>
<p>Hurricane-force winds extended out up to 30 miles from Melissa's center and tropical-storm-force winds extended out up to 195  miles.</p>
<p>Peak storm surge accompanied by destructive waves is forecast to reach 8 to 12 feet in Cuba, 5 to 8 feet in the southeastern Bahamas and 2 to 4 feet in normally dry ground of the Turks and Caicos Islands, the center said.</p><p>The storm's extremely slow pace as it hit Jamaica raised its potential destructive force.</p><p>The strongest previous hurricane to pound Jamaica was Gilbert in 1988, which killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.</p><p>The crew of a U.S. Air Force 403rd Wing "Hurricane Hunters" flight ran into severe turbulence as it approached Melissa's eyewall on Monday and had to return to their base in Florida, but they did capture stunning images of the center of the storm. Another flight on Tuesday to gather data on the hurricane also had to turn back after hitting strong turbulence.</p>
<h2>Hurricane advisories</h2><p>A hurricane warning was in effect early Wednesday for the Cuban provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, Holguin and Las Tunas and for the southeastern and central Bahamas. A hurricane watch was up for Bermuda. </p><p>And a tropical storm warning is posted for Jamaica, Haiti, the Cuban province of Camaguey and for the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p>
<p>In Cuba, a hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantánamo, Holguin and Las Tunas provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Camaguey province.</p><p>Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez said late Tuesday on social media that authorities had evacuated 735,000 people. </p><p>The U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay said it was moving "non-mission-essential" U.S. citizens off the island in groups ahead of severe weather from Melissa. About 1,000 U.S. military personnel have been evacuated.</p><h2>Rainfall forecasts</h2><p>Melissa is expected to bring 4 to 8 inches more across Jamaica, where the storm's total amounts will be between 12 to 24 inches, the hurricane center said, adding that isolated areas could get almost 30 inches over mountainous terrain. "Ongoing catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides will continue through this morning, the center warned.</p><p>"For eastern Cuba," it continued, "storm total rainfall of 10 to 20 inches are expected through today, with local amounts to 25 inches expected over mountainous terrain. This will cause life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides. </p><p>"Over the Southeast Bahamas, storm total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches are expected through today, which will result in areas of flash flooding. </p><p>"For the Turks and Caicos, rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected. Heavy rain may begin to affect Bermuda Thursday night."</p>
<h2>Climate change fueling the storm</h2><p>Above-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures, made worse by <span class="link">climate change</span>, helped Melissa rapidly intensify into a major hurricane, according to climate scientists. </p><p>"That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now — around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal," Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading in the U.K., told The Associated Press. "And it's not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm."</p><p>Stronger winds, heavier rainfall and higher sea level rise will make storm surge more intense.</p><p>Preliminary data from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists monitoring the effects of climate change, suggests that climate change has increased Melissa's wind speed by 10 mph. </p><p>"Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification," Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, told The AP.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump says he expects to strike trade deal with China's Xi at meeting Thursday</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington </em>— President Trump said in South Korea Wednesday that he hopes to emerge from a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping with a U.S.-China trade deal in hand.</p><p>"We're going to be, I hope, making a deal. I think we're going to have a deal. I think it will be a good deal for both," the president said. "The world is watching, and I think we'll have something that's very exciting for everybody."</p><p>Mr. Trump made the remarks during a speech to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, part of a nearly weeklong swing through Asia. Much of his trip has focused on cementing trade agreements and boosting economic ties with U.S. partners in the region — the president has signed trade and tariff deals with Japan, Malaysia and several other countries, and he's holding talks with South Korean officials later in the day. </p><p>But the meeting with Xi in South Korea on Thursday is one the most hotly anticipated part of the trip. The session could be tense, as China and the U.S. have clashed on trade for months. </p><p>The U.S. president is pressing Xi to loosen a set of tough export restrictions on rare earth elements, which are essential for everything from computer chips to aerospace, threatening 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting Saturday unless Beijing backs off. <span class="link">Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday</span> the additional <span class="link">100% tariffs</span> — which would boost the total U.S. rate to 140% — were "effectively off the table" after a two-day meeting with a Chinese negotiator.</p>
<p>The trade war has also led China to cut off purchases of U.S. soybeans, causing pain for American farmers, though Bessent said Sunday he <span class="link">expects the soybean boycott to end</span>. And Mr. Trump <span class="link">needs Chinese approval</span> for a deal to transfer TikTok's U.S. operations from Beijing-based parent company ByteDance.</p><p>Mr. Trump <span class="link">predicted</span> earlier this week that the two leaders will reach an agreement by the end of his trip, saying he has "a lot of respect for President Xi" and "I think we're going to come away with a deal."</p><p>Nicholas Burns, a Biden-era U.S. ambassador to China, told CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes that Wednesday's meeting is "very important," calling the trade war a "test of wills" between the world's two biggest economies.</p><p>"China is the most important competitor, adversary of the United States worldwide now. It will be in the future," Burns said. "So the stakes are high, because we have lots of issues where we are competing with China."</p>
<h2>Trump addresses U.S. partners in Asia</h2><p>The president also used his speech at the APEC event to tout the other trade deals he's inked in Asia. Mr. Trump highlighted his plans to partner with other countries on key industries like shipbuilding, semiconductors and critical minerals, and framed the trade negotiations as an extension of the U.S.'s defense alliances in the region, telling audience members that "economic security is national security."</p>
<p>APEC is a regional economic group with 21 member countries around the Pacific Rim, including China, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam. Promoting free trade is a major component of the forum, despite Mr. Trump's push for higher tariffs on many member countries, a strategy that the president argues is necessary to rebalance trade, but critics warn could lead to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth.</p><p>The president is looking to cinch a trade agreement with South Korea, the United States' sixth-largest trading partner. Over the summer, Mr. Trump <span class="link">announced a framework deal</span> that involves the U.S. charging 15% tariffs on South Korean goods, while South Korea invests billions in U.S. industry and opens its market to American cars. Bessent told reporters the South Korea deal is unlikely to be resolved this week, but it's close.</p><p>During the APAC speech, Mr. Trump called South Korea "a cherished American friend and a close ally." He said he's looking to work with the country on investments in U.S. shipbuilding.</p><p>Before leaving Tokyo, Mr. Trump also <span class="link">signed a trade deal</span> with new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday, cementing 15% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by the president. Japan also pledged $550 billion in investments in U.S. industry. And the president announced trade frameworks with Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand earlier in the trip.</p>
<p>He's also expected to meet at some point with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, as the microchip giant partners with the Department of Energy to build an artificial intelligence supercomputer and presses for more access to China's market.</p><p>And Mr. Trump has said he would be open to meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his trip, though no such meeting has been planned. In Mr. Trump's first term, he became the <span class="link">first sitting president to visit North Korea</span>, a trip that happened after <span class="link">he put an invitation to Kim</span> on social media. Gyeongju, with a population of about 250,000 in southeastern Korea, sits on the opposite side of the country as Seoul, the nation's capital, and thus, is farther from neighboring North Korea. </p>

<div class="article-title">Hurricane Melissa whips Jamaica with violent winds, heavy rain before heading toward Cuba</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Hurricane Melissa made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as a <span class="link">fearsome Category 5 storm</span>, bringing heavy floodwaters across the country's southwest and catastrophic winds that tore roofs off buildings. </p><p>The most powerful hurricane to lash the island since record-keeping began 174 years ago and <span class="link">one of the strongest</span> Atlantic storms ever recorded, Melissa struck Jamaica with sustained winds of 185 mph, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said. </p><p>Melissa weakened somewhat after landfall, with the hurricane center saying in its latest update Tuesday night that winds were at 130 mph, a <span class="link">Category 4</span> speed. The storm was restrengthening as it approached eastern Cuba, the NHC said, and was expected to make landfall there as an extremely dangerous major hurricane early Wednesday morning.</p><p>The storm initially came ashore Tuesday near New Hope, on the southwestern coast of Jamaica, and was traveling northeast at 9 mph, the center said. Landslides, fallen trees and numerous power outages were already being reported earlier Tuesday as the hurricane made its approach, with officials cautioning that the damage assessment will be slow.</p><p>More than 530,000 Jamaicans were without power as of Tuesday evening, according to Minister of Local Government Desmond McKenzie. A section of the roof of Black River Hospital in southwestern Jamaica was damaged by the storm, and the hospital evacuated 75 patients, McKenzie said during a news conference. </p>
<p>Melissa was expected to continue its path over Jamaica and be over southeastern Cuba early Wednesday morning, the NHC said. It could then reach the southeastern or central Bahamas later on Wednesday, still as a hurricane.</p>
<p>"For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure," World Meteorological Organization tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said. She told reporters in Geneva that she expects catastrophic damage on the island, according to the Reuters news service. </p><p>Melissa could affect 1.5 million people in Jamaica, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies official Necephor Mghendi said in Geneva, warning there will be a "massive impact," French news agency AFP reported. </p>
<p>Hours before the storm, the Jamaican government said it had done all it could to prepare as it, too, warned of catastrophic damage.</p><p>"There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5," Prime Minister Andrew Holness said. "The question now is the speed of recovery. That's the challenge."</p>
<p>Melissa is forecast to bring 15 to 30 inches of rain to areas of Jamaica and 6 to 12 inches to southern Hispaniola (the island split into Haiti and the Dominican Republic) through Wednesday, with a total of 40 inches possible in some places. "Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely," the hurricane center warned.</p><p>"We will get through it together," said Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica's meteorological service.  </p>
<p>For eastern Cuba, total rainfall could reach 10 to 20 inches, with as much as 25 inches in some spots through Wednesday, which could result in "life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides," the hurricane center said.</p><p>And total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected into Wednesday in the southeastern Bahamas, resulting in areas of flash flooding.   </p><p>A life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet is expected across southern Jamaica, with officials concerned about the impact on some hospitals along the coastline. </p><p>Health Minister Christopher Tufton said some patients were relocated from the ground floor to the second floor, "and [we] hope that will suffice for any surge that will take place." </p><p>The storm was already blamed for seven deaths in the Caribbean, including three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic, where another person was missing.</p>
<p>Colin Bogle, a Mercy Corps adviser based near Kingston, said most families are sheltering in place despite the government ordering evacuations in flood-prone communities.</p>
<p>"Many have never experienced anything like this before, and the uncertainty is frightening," he said. "There is profound fear of losing homes and livelihoods, of injury, and of displacement."</p><p>Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's water and environment minister, said he had more than 50 generators available to deploy after the storm, but warned people to set aside clean water and use it sparingly.</p><p>"Every drop will count," he said.</p><p>In Cuba, a hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantánamo, Holguin and Las Tunas provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Camaguey province.</p><p>Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez said late Tuesday on social media that authorities had evacuated 735,000 people.</p><p>Melissa has also drenched the southern regions of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with a tropical storm warning still in effect for Haiti. </p><p>A hurricane warning was also in effect for the southeastern and central Bahamas, and a hurricane watch was in effect for Bermuda. A tropical storm warning was also issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands.  </p>
<p>The U.S. State Department issued natural disaster travel alerts for Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and the Bahamas on Monday, urging U.S. citizens to consider leaving while flights were still available, or be prepared to shelter in place.</p><p>And CBS News confirmed that a Hurricane Hunters aircraft from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was forced on Monday to abort its mission when it experienced "severe turbulence" in the storm's southwestern eyewall.  </p>

<div class="article-title">Why the "no hire, no fire" job market may no longer be a thing</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>For most of 2025, the job market was described by economists as "no hire, no fire" — a stretch of time when job seekers faced slim prospects, but workers could count on job security. But that fragile balance may now be shifting, labor experts warn, as mass layoffs at companies like Amazon and UPS signal a possible turning point for the labor market.</p><p>Amazon on Tuesday <span class="link">announced</span> 14,000 job cuts, citing a shift toward artificial intelligence, while UPS on the same day said it has reduced its workforce by 48,000 from a year earlier.</p><p>Target on Tuesday also notified a state employment agency in Minnesota, where the retailer is based, that it plans to lay off more than 800 workers in January as part of a broader corporate restructuring, <span class="link">CBS News Minnesota reported</span>. The retailer announced last week that it would cut 1,800 corporate positions as the chain trims its global workforce by about 8%.</p><p>The mass layoffs come as the Federal Reserve scrutinizes the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing <span class="link">concerns about slower hiring</span> in announcing the central bank's first interest-rate cut of 2025. The announcements from Amazon and UPS could signal that the Fed has good reason to be worried, experts said. </p><p>"No question that this is a shift, and it does seem to me it signals that 'no hire, no fire' is a thing of the past," John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, told CBS News. </p>
<p>"These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy," he added.</p><h2>Layoffs picking up</h2><p>Even before Tuesday's job cuts, layoffs <span class="link">had been trending higher</span>, according to data from Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. Employers across the U.S. cut nearly 950,000 jobs this year through September, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, its most recent data shows.</p><p>Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the <span class="link">government shutdown</span>, which means the Fed will make its <span class="link">next interest rate decision</span> tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September. </p><p>But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August — down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows. </p>
<p>On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers <span class="link">declined by 32,000 jobs</span> in September.</p><p>At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note.</p><p>To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say.</p><p>"When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-à-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up," said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation. </p><p>But, he added, "These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings."</p><p>That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of <span class="link">long-term unemployed people</span>, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022.</p><h2>What's impacting the labor market?</h2><p>Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to <span class="link">trim its human workforce</span> as the business becomes more efficient.</p>
<p>"Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology — and being on the cutting edge of that technology — for shifting jobs," Challenger said. </p><p>About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed.</p><p>Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as <span class="link">shipping declines from Amazon</span>, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS.</p><p>On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government. </p><p>The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside. </p><p>In the meantime, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the job market, according to recent <span class="link">CBS News polling</span>. About 52% of Americans describe the labor market as "bad," up seven percentage points from April, the poll found.</p><p>"We are moving more into a time where job security might be more precarious," Challenger said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Netanyahu orders Israeli army to carry out "powerful strikes" in Gaza</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday he has ordered the army to immediately carry out "powerful strikes" in Gaza, and Hamas responded by saying it would delay handing over the body of a hostage, putting new pressure on the tenuous U.S.-brokered ceasefire.  </p><p>Associated Press reporters and witnesses heard tank fire and saw explosions in various parts of Gaza, including in Gaza City and Deir al-Balah.  </p><p>The order from Netanyahu follows heightened tensions, as Israel reported Hamas firing on its forces in southern Gaza and after <span class="link">Hamas returned a set of remains</span> that Israel said belonged to a hostage recovered earlier in the war.</p><p>"This constitutes a clear violation of the <span class="link">[Gaza peace] agreement</span>" by Hamas, Netanyahu's office said, adding that the prime minister would meet with the heads of Israel's defense establishment, "during which Israel's steps in response to the violations will be discussed."</p><p>In a sign of the fragility of the ceasefire, Israeli troops were shot at in the southern city of Rafah on Tuesday and returned fire, according to an Israeli military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because there hasn't been an official announcement yet.</p>
<p>Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to South Korea, President Trump addressed the clashes, saying "nothing's going to jeopardize" the ceasefire. </p><p>Mr. Trump said Hamas is a "very small part of peace in the Middle East" and that "if they're not good, they're going to be terminated. Their lives will be terminated. and they understand that."</p><p>"Nobody knows what happened to the Israeli soldier, but they say it was sniper fire, and [the Israeli response] was retribution for that, and I think they have a right to do that," Mr. Trump said.</p><p>There are still 13 bodies of hostages in Gaza. Hamas said Tuesday it had recovered the body of a hostage, but after Netanyahu announced the plans to strike Gaza, Hamas said in a statement it would delay the handover.</p>
<p>An Associated Press videographer in Khan Younis witnessed what appeared to be a white body bag being carried out from a tunnel by several men, including some masked militants, and then transported into an ambulance. It was not immediately clear what was in the bag.</p><p>The slow return of hostages' bodies is posing a challenge to implementing the next stages of the ceasefire, which will address even knottier issues, such as the disarmament of Hamas, the deployment of an international security force in Gaza and deciding who will govern the territory.</p><p>The Israel Defense Forces accused Hamas Tuesday of "attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies, while in fact holding deceased hostages whose remains it refuses to release as required by the agreement."  </p><p>The IDF said its drones had recorded Hamas operatives "removing body remains from a structure that had been prepared in advance and burying them nearby" on Monday, and then staging "a false display of discovering a deceased hostage's body."</p><p>Hamas has said it is <span class="link">struggling to locate the bodies</span> amid the vast destruction in Gaza, while Israel has accused the militant group of purposely delaying their return. Over the weekend, Egypt deployed a team of experts and heavy equipment to help search for the bodies of the remaining hostages. That work continued Tuesday in Khan Younis and Nuseirat.</p><p>Israeli hostage negotiator and peace campaigner Gershon Baskin told CBS News earlier this month that it was "very likely that there might be Israeli bodies underneath the rubble" in Gaza, where the Hamas-run government estimates that at least 90% of the <span class="link">buildings have been damaged or destroyed</span>.</p><p>This is the second time since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10 that remains turned over by Hamas have been problematic. Israel said one of the bodies Hamas released in the first week of the ceasefire belonged to an unidentified Palestinian.</p>
<p>During a previous ceasefire in February 2025, Hamas said it handed over the bodies of three hostages, Shiri Bibas and her two sons, but testing showed that one of the bodies returned was identified as a Palestinian woman. Shiri Bibas' body was returned a day later.</p><p>The remains returned overnight have been identified as belonging to Ofir Tzarfati, Netanyahu's office said.</p><p>Tzarfati was kidnapped from the Nova music festival in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel that started the war. In all, the militants killed some 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages.</p><p>Tzarfati was killed in captivity and his body was retrieved by Israeli troops in November 2023. In March 2024, his family received additional remains for burial.</p><p>Tzarfati's family said in a statement that this is the third time "we have been forced to open Ofir's grave and rebury our son."</p><p>In exchange for 15 dead hostages returned from Gaza since the ceasefire began, Israel has handed back to Gaza 195 Palestinian bodies. The last 20 living hostages were returned to Israel at the start of the ceasefire, and in exchange, Israel freed roughly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, Israeli authorities said they had killed three Palestinian militants during an operation in the northern part of the occupied West Bank, the latest action in Israel's stepped-up military activity in the territory since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack.</p>
<p>Israeli police said the three men were shot as they came out of a cave near Jenin, a town in the northern West Bank known as a militant stronghold. The Israeli military said in a statement that the militants "took part in terror activity in Jenin," but gave no further details.</p><p>Two militants were shot and killed in the initial volley of gunfire. The third, who was wounded, was killed shortly after, according to the Israeli military.</p><p>An earlier statement said the Israeli military carried out an airstrike shortly afterward to destroy the cave. The army confirmed an airstrike in the area but gave no further details.</p><p>Hamas condemned the Jenin strike and later identified two of the three men as militants with Hamas' Qassam Brigades. The third man was referred to as a "comrade," but no additional details about him were given.</p><p>Israel says its operations have cracked down on militants in the West Bank. But Palestinians and human rights groups say scores of uninvolved civilians have also been among the dead, while tens of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes.</p><p>Over 68,500 Palestinians have died in the two-year war in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><article class="content content-article lazyload" data-index="0" data-path="/news/federal-judge-disqualifies-bill-essayli-trump-doj-top-federal-prosecutor-in-l-a/" id="article-0">
<section class="content__body">
<p>A federal judge ruled Tuesday that the Justice Department's top prosecutor in Los Angeles has served unlawfully in his role for months, the latest court to push back on the Trump administration's efforts to name acting prosecutors. </p><p>U.S. District Judge Michael Seabright ruled that acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, who oversees the Justice Department's outpost in the Central District of California, cannot participate in prosecuting three people who were charged with gun crimes. The judge rejected a request by the three defendants to toss out their charges altogether.</p><p>Essayli — a former California Republican state lawmaker — was named interim U.S. attorney in April, a role that's typically limited to just 120 days. But days before the clock ran out, Essayli resigned and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi immediately named him first assistant U.S. attorney because, under federal law, the holder of that job becomes the office's acting head when there's a vacancy. </p><p>Seabright ruled that this maneuver was unlawful because only the first assistant U.S. attorney who is already in place when the office becomes vacant is eligible to become acting chief.</p><p>"Simply stated: Essayli unlawfully assumed the role of Acting United States Attorney for the Central District of California. He has been unlawfully serving in that capacity since his resignation from the interim role on July 29, 2025," Seabright wrote. "Essayli may not perform the functions and duties of the United States Attorney as Acting United States Attorney. He is disqualified from serving in that role."</p>
<p>Seabright said Essayli can continue to serve as first assistant U.S. attorney.</p><p>In several states, the Trump administration has <span class="link">sought to keep</span> federal prosecutors in temporary roles for months. Critics argue the administration is trying to sidestep the Senate, which is responsible for confirming permanent U.S. attorneys, and the federal judiciary, which can opt to extend the terms of interim U.S. attorneys in some cases.</p><p>Essayli joins two other acting U.S. attorneys — <span class="link">Alina Habba</span> of New Jersey and <span class="link">Sigal Chattah</span> of Nevada — who have been disqualified for similar reasons, though a judge put Chattah's disqualification on hold pending appeal. </p><p>In addition, two Trump foes who are facing criminal charges — former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James — are challenging the appointment of acting U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan in the Eastern District of Virginia. </p>

<div class="article-title">What's known about the reclusive donor offering to help pay troops amid shutdown</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Last week, President Trump announced an anonymous "patriot" had given a donation of $130 million  — money the president said was to be used to help pay troops during the <span class="link">government shutdown</span>. </p><p>There are questions about the legality of a donation of this sort (the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from exceeding congressional appropriations or accepting voluntary services). Over the weekend, The New York Times identified the anonymous donor as Timothy Mellon, a reclusive railroad magnate and heir to the Gilded Age Mellon family fortune. </p>
<p>Mellon, 83, emerged as one of the top Republican donors only in the past few years, giving far less in the decades before 2017.</p><p>Anna Massoglia, a campaign finance researcher, told CBS News, "Timothy Mellon was a relatively unknown political donor but his contributions have surged in recent years, putting him in the very top ranks of political contributors." </p><p>Early in his adult life, he held liberal views on race, the problem of income inequality and the environment. As Mellon's business career evolved, he began to express a strong antipathy for what he viewed as intrusive government regulations on business. One turning point seems to be when he ran afoul of environmental regulators in Connecticut in the late 1990s over an airport he bought. </p>
<p>He's written a memoir and penned some opinion pieces that offer some insight into his political views. Mellon wrote that a favorite quote of his came from Winston Churchill: "Show me a young Conservative and I'll show you someone with no heart. Show me an old Liberal and I'll show you someone with no brains."</p><p>Mellon did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Here are some numbers associated with Mellon:</p><h2>At least $197 million: How much Mellon donated to Trump and Republicans in the 2024 election</h2><p>Mellon may be an obscure figure to the wider public, but he's well known in political circles for giving more than virtually any other donor to Mr. Trump and other Republican committees during the 2024 election cycle — at least $197 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. The only person who gave more was SpaceX and Tesla CEO <span class="link">Elon Musk</span>.</p>
<p>He emerged on the political scene as a megadonor relatively late in life. Over two decades, from 1996 to 2017, he gave a total of $350,000 in donations to political candidates. But in the four years between January 2020 and June 2024 he gave $227 million to federal candidates and political committees.  </p><p>Last year, Mellon made a $50 million donation to a Trump-affiliated super PAC, one of the largest individual contributions ever made public. That was one of several donations to the super PAC during the 2024 election cycle, totaling around $150 million. He also contributed $13 million to the Sentinel Action Fund, a voter turnout super PAC that used to be affiliated with Heritage Action, the sister organization of the conservative Heritage Foundation. </p><h2>$25 million: How much Mellon gave to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign</h2><p>Mellon also gave $25 million to support <span class="link">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s</span> 2024 presidential campaign. Some speculated that Mellon was trying to be a spoiler to help Mr. Trump, whom he was also backing financially. </p><p>But last August, he wrote an article in the American Spectator explaining his support for Kennedy. Mellon, it turns out, is a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic. "I could not fathom how a 'vaccine' could be foisted on the general public with so little (if any) adequate testing." </p><p>He began giving to Kennedy's <span class="link">Children's Health Defense</span>, which promotes false information about vaccines, and later to the Super PAC supporting Kennedy's campaign.</p><h2>$14.1 billion: The Mellon family's estimated wealth</h2><p>Timothy Mellon, the grandson of banker and industrialist Andrew Mellon, was estimated by Forbes to be worth about $1 billion last year, though he told Forbes in an email at the time that he was not a billionaire, writing, "never have been, never will be." The estimated wealth of his family, including other branches, was estimated in 2024 by Forbes to be $14.1 billion. </p><h2>340: The number of trees he cut down at a Connecticut airport he bought</h2><p>One defining episode for Mellon occurred after he purchased an airport in Connecticut in the late 1990s. He cut down 340 trees, arguing that they posed a danger to pilots landing their planes. But state environmental regulators ultimately sued him and won. He was ordered to pay tens of thousands of dollars in damages.</p>
<h2>$53 million: How much he donated to build a border wall in Texas</h2><p>In 2021, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced Texas would build its own border wall and started his own private fund to build it. He made little progress — the Texas Tribune said his effort had slowed after raising a little over $1 million, and then Mellon chipped in $53 million. The private and public effort was quietly dropped earlier this year, as the GOP-led legislature defunded construction in June, and the crowdfunding link disappeared in late May, the Tribune reported. The state built about 65 miles of wall out of the 805 miles that Abbott planned, and it's riddled with gaps because many landowners do not want the border wall on their land.</p><p><em>Editor's note: An earlier version of this article said that Mellon contributed $13 million to the Sentinel Action Fund, a super PAC affiliated with the conservative Heritage Foundation, which produced </em><span class="link"><em>Project 2025</em></span><em>. But the group was founded as part of its sister organization, Heritage Action for America in 2022. In 2023, the Sentinel Action Fund relaunched as a separate super PAC. The story has been updated.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Trump fires board that oversees D.C. construction projects</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump on Tuesday fired all six sitting members of a board that oversees architecture in Washington, D.C., CBS News has confirmed, as the president plans a slate of major building projects in the capital city — including a massive White House ballroom.</p><p>"We are preparing to appoint a new slate of members to the commission that are more aligned with President Trump's America First Policies," a White House official told CBS News.</p><p>The Commission of Fine Arts had six members, all of whom were appointed during former President Joe Biden's term. Their ouster is not without precedent: The Biden administration replaced at least six members of the commission who were named during Mr. Trump's first term.</p><p>The firings come as Mr. Trump seeks to put his stamp on D.C., with plans to replace the White House's East Wing with a <span class="link">90,000-square-foot ballroom</span> and build a gigantic triumphal arch across the river from D.C. He also signed an executive order in August titled "Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again," which called for classical architecture modeled on ancient Greece and Rome to be the default style for D.C.-area buildings moving forward.</p>
<p>The Commission of Fine Arts is one of several boards that reviews, provides comments on and approves construction in the capital, along with the National Capital Planning Commission. Mr. Trump picked three new members of the latter commission in July, including Chair William Scharf, a White House aide.</p>
<p>It's not clear whether the White House intends to submit its ballroom plans to the Commission of Fine Arts, which has <span class="link">overseen</span> some prior White House projects. A White House official told CBS News last week that the plans <span class="link">will be submitted</span> to the National Capital Planning Commission.</p><p>Mr. Trump's construction kick has drawn a polarizing response. The sudden decision to demolish the East Wing last week — despite Mr. Trump's earlier claim that the ballroom project would not touch the existing building — <span class="link">has faced criticism</span>, and some historic preservation groups have <span class="link">urged the Trump administration</span> to go through the normal approval process for the ballroom project.</p><p>"This project represents one of the most substantial alterations to the White House in modern history," Democratic Reps. Jared Huffman, Robert Garcia and Yassamin Ansari said in a letter to the president. "The decisions were made in complete secrecy and undertaken without public disclosure or proper consultation."</p><p>The White House, meanwhile, has called the pushback "manufactured outrage" and argued that prior presidents have also made changes to the complex. The administration has also cast the ballroom as a necessary addition to a building that's lacking in large event spaces.</p>
<p>At a dinner earlier this month to thank private donors to the $300 million ballroom project, Mr. Trump marveled at how easily he was able to kick off construction.</p><p>"They said, 'Sir, you can start tonight," the president — no stranger to real estate development — told attendees. "'You have zero zoning conditions. You're the president.'"</p>

<div class="article-title">AI data center in Louisiana brings unwanted construction, rising energy bills</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Lisa Hopkins bought her house in Louisiana's Richland Parish two years ago, but lately, her family only finds peace and quiet on their front porch at night, after construction stops for the day.</p><p>That's because Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, is now building its largest artificial intelligence data center in the country right across the street.</p><p>"It's always noise, all the time," Hopkins told CBS News, adding, "We honestly didn't know how big of a scale it was gonna be... Some mornings it's hard to get out of our driveway, just because of all the dump trucks."</p><p>Louisiana approved the $10 billion project in August, saying it would bring "hope" for economic growth.</p><p>But some experts say the center's power demands will <span class="link">raise customers' power bills</span> statewide. The state's main utility company — Entergy — agreed to pay for a $550 million transmission line to the center, a cost that experts say will be passed on to the 1.1 million customers under Entergy Louisiana's umbrella. This, in a parish where nearly a quarter of the population lives in poverty, according to the state's utility commission. </p>
<p>That's not the only reason people in Louisiana could see higher utility bills —  state officials who approved the plan admit the increased energy demand from the site could, in turn, increase gas prices.   </p><p>"This single data center is set to span an amount of land that is about 70 football fields worth of land, and it's going to consume roughly three times the amount of electricity that the entire city of New Orleans consumes on an annual basis," Paul Arbaje, an energy analyst with the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, told CBS News.  </p><p>The Hopkins family showed CBS News their power bills, which indicated the fuel costs on their bill went up by about $13 a month compared to last year.  </p><p>As the nationwide construction boom in new data centers continues, other communities are already feeling the impacts. Some customers in at least 13 states are seeing higher utility bills because of new data centers, according to the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.</p>
<p>"We're all kind of sharing the pain in that fight," Arbaje said. "It's up to state regulators, really, to step in and protect consumers and make sure that tech companies and utility companies are paying their fair share for this development."</p><p>Meta's head of community development in North America, Katie Comer, said they're working with Entergy to reduce customer impacts, telling CBS News that Meta has "invested a million dollars into their bill pay assistance program to support low-income families."</p><p>Asked about concerns from residents that Meta is imposing on the neighborhood, Comer said, "We are actively on the ground every day. We want to listen and learn and meet the community where they're at."</p><p>Comer added Meta is also investing $200 million into local infrastructure projects and partnering with local school programs to help the community's long-term development. </p><p>"This community as a whole is incredibly special," Comer said. "We've been very proud of the work that we've been able to do together. I am extremely excited about the work that we will do in the future together."</p><p>Entergy has said that Meta coming to Louisiana will actually mean lower customer power bills, adding in a statement that resilience upgrades could reduce electricity bills by 10%.</p><p>Resident Donna Collins, who has lived in the region her entire life, said she hopes it's true, "but I'm going to have to see it to believe it."</p>
<p>Collins told CBS News that she felt outreach by the state and Meta for local input was sorely lacking.</p><p>"I definitely don't feel like I had a say, and I don't know many people that do," she said.</p><p>Hopkins said she never received any notices about public hearings in the mail.</p><p>"It's not fair. It's not something that we asked to be put here," Hopkins said.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>In Bangor, Maine, Geoff Clarke has something a lot of Americans do not: high praise for his recent health care checkup.</p><p>"If I was doing it in a dream, it was exactly like my dream," Clarke told CBS News.</p><p>Clarke is a new patient of Alley and Brad Tuttle, a husband and wife team who've started Apotheosis Health, offering what's known as direct primary care. In this alternative care model, patients pay a regular fee in exchange for unlimited access to certain medical services, while cutting out insurance as a middleman.</p><p>Direct primary care has exploded in the last decade, going from 140 practices to nearly 3,000 in the United States, according to data from the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine and DPC mapper. </p><p>For less than $100 a month, Apotheosis Health patients get the basics, including physicals, blood tests, discounted prescriptions and a patient-first attitude.</p>
<p>"Kind of going back to the family doctor feel, where you go in, you're not rushed, really develop that relationship," Brad Tuttle told CBS News. </p><p>One-third of Americans do not have a primary care provider, according to the National Association of Community Health Centers, which drives up chronic disease rates, hospitalizations and late diagnoses.  </p><p>"A lot of cancer is preventable with screenings, mammograms, colonoscopies. If you don't have a primary care provider ordering these things for you, they're not getting done," Alley Tuttle said.</p><p>About a quarter of all health care visits in the U.S. are now delivered by non-physicians, including nurse practitioners like Alley, along with physician assistants, according to Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>"If your issues are complex, you need to see a specialist for that. Most things, though, can be addressed here," Alley Tuttle said.</p><p>For Dani Cotou, who was diagnosed with leukemia last year, the Tuttles provide exactly what she feels she needs.</p><p>"I feel that I'm the driver and they're my co-pilots," Cotou told CBS News. </p><p>Plus, in an age of physician burnout and with relentless patient quotas to be met, the Tuttles say this approach is not just good for the patients, but also good for the providers.</p><p>"It increases a work-life balance for providers, and that's why we're here, is we have three kids and we'd like to spend some time with them," Brad Tuttle said.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington </em>— The U.S. military on Monday struck four more vessels that were allegedly trafficking narcotics in the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing 14 and leaving one survivor, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on X. </p><p>The four vessels were hit in three different strikes, Hegseth said. The strikes bring the total death toll in President Trump's <span class="link">campaign</span> against alleged traffickers in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific to more than 50. </p><p>"The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics," Hegseth wrote. "Eight male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessels during the first strike. Four male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the second strike. Three male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the third strike. A total of 14 narco-terrorists were killed during the three strikes, with one survivor. All strikes were in international waters with no U.S. forces harmed."</p><p>He added: "These narco-terrorists have killed more Americans than Al-Qaeda, and they will be treated the same. We will track them, we will network them, and then, we will hunt and kill them."</p><p>Hegseth said U.S. military personnel immediately began search and rescue operations for the survivor, and Mexican authorities assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue. It's not clear what happened to the survivor from there. </p>
<p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum confirmed at a Tuesday morning news conference that the strike was in international waters and the Mexican Navy rescued one person.</p><p>In a statement, the Mexican Navy confirmed it was "conducting a maritime search and rescue operation 400 miles southwest of Acapulco" at the request of the U.S. Coast Guard.</p><p>Mr. Trump, currently on a multiday trip in Asia, has said his administration will provide information about the strikes to Congress, but he won't seek a declaration of war.</p><p>"I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK? We're going to kill them. You know? They're going to be like, dead," he said last week. </p>
<p>Mr. Trump also said land strikes in Venezuela could come next, amid heightened tensions between the two countries.</p><p>Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, has called the military airstrikes on the boats "extrajudicial killings." Paul told "Fox News Sunday" this week that Congress has received "no information" on the strike campaign from the administration. </p>

<div class="article-title">Bill Gates shifts tone on climate, criticizes "doomsday view"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>For decades, Bill Gates has warned of climate disaster — but his tone meaningfully shifted Tuesday as the billionaire Microsoft co-founder cautioned against taking a "doomsday view" on the planet's future.</p><p>In a memo posted online, Gates wrote that while climate change is still a major problem that needs to be solved, "People will be able to live and thrive on Earth for the foreseeable future." Gates, who has invested billions developing green technologies to cut greenhouse gases, says doomsday climate scenarios over-emphasize cutting emissions while "diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world." </p><p>The lengthy memo essentially argued that we should continue to <span class="link">innovate</span> and back climate breakthroughs but not at the expense of funding for global health or development — "programs that help people stay resilient in the face of climate change." He argued for putting "human welfare at the center of our climate strategies," including improving health and agriculture in the world's poorest countries.</p><p>In years past, Gates, the author of "How to Avoid a Climate Disaster," struck a more alarmist tone.</p><p>In <span class="link">an interview</span> with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in 2021, he warned: "If we don't reduce emissions, then the death toll would be even worse near the equator, and the unrest would be global in nature." He added, "You've got to start work now to avoid those terrible consequences much later." </p>
<p>Gates described climate change as the most formidable challenge humanity has ever faced. He told Anderson Cooper in <span class="link">a "60 Minutes" interview</span> that same year that climate change is "way greater than the pandemic. And it needs a level of cooperation that would be unprecedented." </p><p>Gates has personally invested over $2 billion in green technology and launched Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a firm formed with other billionaires to fund research and technology aimed at finding solutions to reduce <span class="link">carbon emissions</span>. </p><p>Gates' memo drew a mixed response. Some agreed that climate change isn't the greatest threat to humanity, while others slammed the memo for understating the consequences of climate change.</p><p>Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, climate scientist and professor at Texas Tech University, says the problem of climate change cannot be separated from the other major threats that humanity faces because it contributes to them, including in the developing world. </p>
<p>"Just give me a list of people's top 10 things to worry about, and I can tell you how climate change is making every single one of those top 10 things worse," she said. </p><p>Dr. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, called the memo a "breathtaking misread" that lacks an understanding of what it would mean for the world to experience 2 or 3 degrees Celsius of warming.</p><p>"I think it grossly misrepresents the magnitude of the consequences we're going to see, ironically, for the same people the memo claims to be looking out for — the global poor."  </p><p>Timothy Gallaudet, a retired Rear Admiral who oversaw weather forecasting for the U.S. Navy, questions some climate assessments, including doomsday scenarios.</p><p>"Ultimately, there's real impacts, but so much is reported erroneously," he said. "There's so much misinformation in the climate space now, it's a real shame."</p><p>Gallaudet believes moving away from "climate doomsday alarmism" and focusing on adaptation and technological improvements to forecasting is beneficial, more realistic, and practical.</p><p>Ted Nordhaus is founder and executive director of global research center Breakthrough Institute (not to be confused with Gates' Breakthrough Energy). He said that climate change is a problem, but it doesn't pose the existential threat that some have cautioned. </p>
<p>In a column for The Free Press (which, like CBS News, is owned by Paramount Skydance), Nordhaus wrote that climate tipping points like the melting of ice sheets and the deforestation of the Amazon "don't add up to catastrophic outcomes for humanity." </p><p>Per Nordhaus, scientific evidence doesn't suggest climate change is the greatest threat facing humanity, and it shouldn't take top consideration when the world has already proven it can adapt to a warming atmosphere. </p><p>"We've always adapted, that's why we have humans living across huge variances in climatic zones," he told CBS News. "I think the point of Gates' letter is we're actually making a fair amount of progress here to reduce emissions and continuing to be more resilient." </p><p>With the global climate summit known as COP30 coming up next month in Brazil, Gates urged world leaders, business and activists to chart a new path forward.</p><p>"This is a chance to refocus on the metric that should count even more than emissions and temperature change: improving lives," he wrote.</p>

<div class="article-title">Senate approves Democratic resolution to block Trump's tariffs on Brazil</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington — </em>The Senate voted on Tuesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure in a rebuke to the president.</p><p>Led by Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, the resolution would terminate the national emergency that the administration is using to impose 50% tariffs on goods from Brazil. </p><p>The vote to approve the measure was 52 to 48. Republican Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul joined Democrats to vote in favor. The resolution required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation. </p><p>In July, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to "recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil" that he said constitute an "unusual and extraordinary threat." The move came during the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was ultimately convicted and <span class="link">sentenced to 27 years in prison</span> for attempting a coup in 2022.</p><p>"President Trump's tariff regime — global, Brazilian tariffs, Canadian tariffs, tariff deals announced then paused, tariff deals negotiated, exceptions granted and in some cases not granted — have created huge chaos in the national economy," Kaine said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. "Tariffs are a tax on American consumers. Tariffs are a tax on American businesses. And they are a tax that is imposed by a single person: Donald J. Trump."</p>
<p>Kaine told reporters that the president's emergency order was "unusual and extreme," and accused him of putting it in place due to the "decision to prosecute Donald Trump's friend."</p>
<p>"If that's an emergency, then anything is an emergency, and any president can make up anything and call it an emergency and then use massive powers to impose regulations or evade regulations," Kaine said. </p><p>The bill will still need to pass the House and be signed by the president, meaning it is mostly symbolic. House Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.</p><p>But Kaine said Tuesday that he has learned that "the president is responsive to things like this."</p><p>"When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior," he said. </p>
<p>One of those Republican yes votes was McConnell, a former Senate majority leader who has clashed with Mr. Trump for years — including on trade policy. McConnell has long been skeptical of tariffs and supportive of free trade, a stance that was essentially considered doctrine in pre-Trump GOP politics.</p><p>"Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive," McConnell said in a statement prior to the vote. "The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule."</p><p>Earlier in the day, Vice President JD Vance met with Senate Republicans at the Capitol and urged them to reject the resolution.</p><p>"The point that I made to my Republican colleagues, recognizing that there's a diversity of opinions about it, is that the tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first," Vance told reporters after the meeting. "They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country. They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas."</p><p>The president cited a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act in his order imposing the Brazil tariffs. The act gives any senator the authority to force a vote to challenge the move, effectively bypassing Senate leadership.</p><p>In April, four Republicans joined Democrats to <span class="link">approve a measure</span> aimed at blocking the Canada tariffs. Those Republicans were Murkowski of Alaska, Collins of Maine and McConnell, along with Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who cosponsored the legislation. Later that month, an effort aimed at blocking Mr. Trump's <span class="link">"Liberation Day" tariffs</span> on countries around the world fell short, with two senators who had previously backed the tariff measure absent from the vote. The resolutions need a simple majority to pass. </p><p>Kaine said he would force additional votes on Canadian tariffs and global tariffs throughout the week as he pushes back on the administration and puts pressure on Senate Republicans. </p>
<p>"So the votes are about tariffs, and they're about the economic destruction of tariffs, but they are also really about, how much will we let a president get away with?" Kaine said. "Do my colleagues have a gag reflex or not, in terms of powers that constitutionally are handed to Congress?"</p>

<div class="article-title">Obesity rate is declining as more Americans use weight loss drugs, survey finds</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>As more Americans turn to weight loss drugs, the U.S. adult obesity rate is declining, according to new survey data from Gallup.</p><p>The data published Tuesday showed the obesity rate among participants has gradually declined to 37% in 2025 after previously hitting a record high of 39.9% in 2022. Results were based on data from three nationally representative surveys of 16,946 U.S. adults interviewed by web in the first three quarters of 2025.</p><p>"This is a statistically meaningful decrease representing an estimated 7.6 million fewer obese adults compared with three years ago," the report noted.</p><p>In the report, obesity was defined using the federal standard of having a BMI of 30 or higher.</p><p>The report also explored the simultaneous increase in GLP-1 drug usage for weight loss, including semaglutides like Ozempic and <span class="link">Wegovy</span>. These drugs are also used to treat type 2 diabetes, which the report noted was still at an all-time high, with 13.8% of Gallup's Well-Being Index participants saying they've been diagnosed with the chronic disease.</p>
<p>When Gallup first measured GLP-1 usage in February 2024, 5.8% of adults reported taking this type of medicine for weight loss. Now, the percentage has increased to 12.4%, the report said.</p><p>"Amid increased use of GLP-1 injectables for weight loss, obesity rates have been coming down for most age groups since 2022," the report added.</p><p>The report found the biggest reduction in obesity was among those aged 40 to 49 and those aged 50 to 64. These are the same age groups with the highest rates of GLP-1 injectables for weight loss, the report said.</p><p>The report does have some limitations, however, including potential bias in how respondents present themselves.</p>
<p>"However, because Gallup's method of collecting self-reported weight and height has been consistent, the trend still provides valuable information regarding changes over time," the report said.</p><p>Gallup also did not measure GLP-1 usage for weight loss in 2022 or 2023, but said available data via its Well-Being Index are "consistent with reports of steadily increasing use since the initial FDA approval in 2021."</p><p>Despite the reported decline in obesity rates, the U.S. continues to exceed many Western countries in weight, the report pointed out — but expanding access to weight loss treatments may be a factor in the obesity decline becoming a lasting trend, the authors note.</p><p>Around 40% of adults in the U.S. are obese, <span class="link">data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested</span> in September 2024 — marking the first time in over a decade that the nation's <span class="link">obesity</span> rate has not inched up, results from the federal government's national health survey showed. </p>

<div class="article-title">Poachers are killing spider monkeys and selling their babies on social media</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Bound, sedated and stuffed into bags: Poachers are ripping baby spider monkeys from their mothers in the forests of southern Mexico and selling them as pets on social media platforms in the United States.</p><p>Jim Stinebaugh, a special agent with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, says nearly 90 baby spider monkeys have been confiscated at the Texas-Mexico border in the last 18 months – and that's believed to be just a fraction of the spider monkeys illegally brought into the United States.</p><p>Wildlife officials say the spike in spider monkey smuggling is driven in part by viral videos showing the animals dressed up, diapered and treated like human babies. Those clips racking up millions of views may look cute, but experts warn they glamorize illegal pet ownership and fail to show the cruel conditions for monkeys torn from the wild.</p><p>Investigative photos document the cruelty of how baby spider monkeys are smuggled across the border. Traffickers smuggle the spider monkeys in horrific conditions, often crammed into tiny compartments with no food or water. Many arrive sick, injured or clinging to life, with authorities racing to save those that survive the brutal journey.</p><p>In Mexico, poachers shoot mother spider monkeys out of trees, with their babies still clinging to their backs. And because the moms only give birth every two to four years, the population is slow to recover. </p>
<p>"You're going to have to kill the mothers to get the babies, and then the rest of the family are going to be protective of the mother and the baby as well," Stinebaugh explained. "You very well may end up killing dozens of monkeys, just to keep a few of the babies."</p><p>Stinebaugh focuses on catching smugglers who sell through social media platforms. It's an uphill battle because law enforcement is understaffed, and the penalties are often small.</p><p>He warned: "If you're paying cash for a spider monkey in the parking lot of a big-box store, there's something wrong."</p><p>Baby spider monkeys can't be returned to the wild without their mothers, so agents bring them to the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas, where five veterinarians care for 1,600 other animals. But one Texas zoo can't tackle the problem alone, so the Association of Zoos and Aquariums is piloting a project where facilities house, care for and permanently place spider monkeys at other accredited facilities around the country.</p>
<p>Stinebaugh believes that if people understood the brutality of the spider monkey black-market trade, they would see the truth: that we're pushing these animals closer to extinction.</p><p>His message: "If you care at all about this species, if you don't want them killed in the wild, if you don't want the babies smuggled across the border and these abhorrent conditions, don't make the purchase."</p>

<html><body><div><article class="content content-article lazyload" data-index="0" data-path="/news/amelia-earhart-plane-expedition-locate-delayed/" id="article-0">
<section class="content__body">
<p>An <span class="link">expedition</span> to try to locate Amelia Earhart's plane on a remote island in the Pacific has been delayed until next year, Purdue University said Monday. </p><p>A team of researchers was planning to travel to Nikumaroro Island in early November to determine whether something known as the Taraia Object — a visual anomaly seen in satellite and other imagery — is Earhart's aircraft. They are now awaiting additional clearances from local authorities as they work through the permit approvals, and cannot go later this year due to the start of cyclone season, according to a news release.</p><p>"We've overcome other challenges to this project over the past four years, and we will get past this one, too," Richard Pettigrew, executive director of the Archaeological Legacy Institute, said in the release. "Because of the compelling evidence we have in front of us, we have to go to Nikumaroro and get a close look at the Taraia Object. Rest assured that we will do just that, so stay tuned! We will have a revised project schedule worked out soon."  </p><p>The underwater object has been visible in photos dating back to 1938, the year after Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan <span class="link">disappeared</span> while Earhart — flying a Lockheed 10-E Electra — tried to become the first female aviator to circle the world.</p>
<p>Researchers previously said there is <span class="link">"very strong" evidence</span> that the object, which is in a lagoon on Nikumaroro, a small island in Kiribati about halfway between Australia and Hawaii, is the iconic aviator's plane. Some, however, have expressed skepticism. "We've looked there in that spot, and there's nothing there," Ric Gillespie, executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, told NBC News in July.</p>
<p>A team of researchers from Purdue and the Archaeological Legacy Institute plan to take photos and videos of the site, then use magnetometers and sonar devices to scan the area. The item will then be dredged and lifted from the water so researchers can attempt to identify it. </p><p>Expedition member Steve Schultz, who is Purdue University's senior vice president and general counsel, said "maritime expeditions require thorough preparation and numerous clearances."</p><p>"We have gained valuable insights throughout this process and are very confident and resolved to continue this quest with a planned 2026 departure," he said.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said Wednesday its recent test-firings of sea-to-surface cruise missiles were successful, in another display of its growing military capabilities as U.S. President Donald Trump visits South Korea.</p> <p>North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said the missiles fired Tuesday flew for more than two hours before accurately striking targets in its western waters. It said the weapons would contribute to expanding the operational sphere of the country's nuclear-armed military.</p>
<p>South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the military had detected the North Korean launch preparations and that the cruise missiles were fired in the North's northwestern waters at around 3 p.m. Tuesday. The joint chiefs said South Korea and the United States were analyzing the weapons and maintaining a combined defense readiness capable of a "dominant response" against any North Korean provocation.</p> <p>The North Korean report came hours before an expected summit between Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in the city of Gyeongju, where South Korea is hosting this year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings.</p> <p>Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One en route from Japan to South Korea, Trump downplayed the North Korean launches.</p> <p>"He's been launching missiles for decades, right?" he said, apparently referring to Kim Jong Un. Trump reiterated he still wants to meet with Kim, whom he met three times in 2018 and 2019 before their diplomacy derailed over disagreements on U.S.-led sanctions against the North.</p> <p>"We had a really good understanding of each other," Trump said.</p>
<p>KCNA said the tests were attended by senior military official Pak Jong Chon, who also inspected training for sailors aboard North Korea's newly developed destroyers Choe Hyon and Kang Kon, which leader Kim Jong Un has described as key assets in his efforts to strengthen the navy.</p> <p>North Korea's latest launches followed short-range ballistic missile tests last week that it said involved a new hypersonic system designed to strengthen its nuclear war deterrent.</p> <p>During his South Korean visit, Trump is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. However, South Korean officials have said a Trump–Kim meeting is unlikely.</p>
<p>North Korea has shunned any form of talks with Washington and Seoul since Kim's high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Trump fell apart in 2019 during the American president's first term.</p> <p>Kim's top foreign policy priority is now Russia. In recent months, he has sent thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment to help fuel President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine, while embracing the idea of a "new Cold War" and positions his country as part of a united front against the U.S.-led West.</p> <p>Last month, Kim reiterated he wouldn't return to talks with the United States unless Washington drops its demand for North Korea's denuclearization, after Trump repeatedly expressed his hopes for new diplomacy.</p>

<div class="article-title">Huge Brazilian raid on Rio gang leaves at least 64 people dead and 81 under arrest</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>RIO DE JANEIRO — About 2,500 Brazilian police and soldiers launched a massive raid on a drug-trafficking gang in Rio de Janeiro on Tuesday, arresting 81 suspects and sparking shootouts that left at least 60 suspects and four police officers dead, officials said.</p> <p>The operation included officers in helicopters and armored vehicles and targeted the notorious Red Command in the sprawling low-income favelas of Complexo de Alemao and Penha, police said.</p> <p>The police operation was one of the most violent in Brazil's recent history, with human rights organizations calling for investigations into the deaths.</p> <p>Rio's state Gov. Claudio Castro said in a video posted on X that 60 criminal suspects were "neutralized" during the massive raid that he called the biggest such operation in the city's history. Some 81 suspects were arrested, while 93 rifles and more than half a ton of drugs were seized, the state government said, adding that those killed "resisted police action."</p>
<p>Rio's civil police said on X that four officers died in Tuesday's operation. "The cowardly attacks by criminals against our agents will not go unpunished," it said.</p> <p>An unknown number of people were wounded.</p> <p>The United Nations' human rights body said it was "horrified" by the deadly police operation, called for effective investigations and reminded authorities of their obligations under international human rights law.</p> <p>César Muñoz, director of Human Rights Watch in Brazil, called Tuesday's events "a huge tragedy" and a "disaster."</p> <p>"The public prosecutor's office must open its own investigations and clarify the circumstances of each death," Muñoz said in a statement.</p>
<p>Footage on social media showed fire and smoke rising from the two favelas as gunfire rang out. The city's Education Department said 46 schools across the two neighborhoods were closed, and the nearby Federal University of Rio de Janeiro canceled night classes and told people on campus to seek shelter.</p> <p>Suspected gang members blocked roads in northern and southeastern Rio in response to the raid, local media reported. At least 70 buses were commandeered to be used in the blockades, causing significant damage, the city's bus organization Rio Onibus said.</p> <p>The operation Tuesday followed a year of investigation into the criminal group, police said.</p>
<p>Gov. Castro, from the conservative opposition Liberal Party, said the federal government should be providing more support to combat crime — a swipe at the administration of leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.</p> <p>Gleisi Hoffmann, the Lula administration's liaison with the parliament, agreed that coordinated action was needed but pointed to a recent crackdown on money laundering as an example of the federal government's action on organized crime.</p>
<p>Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and a number of ministers met in response to the operation on Tuesday afternoon. Chief of Staff Rui Costa requested an emergency meeting in Rio on Wednesday, with him in attendance as well as Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski.</p> <p>Emerging from Rio's prisons, the Red Command criminal gang has expanded its control in favelas in recent years.</p> <p>Rio has been the scene of lethal police raids for decades. In March 2005, some 29 people were killed in Rio's Baixada Fluminense region, while in May 2021, 28 were killed in the Jacarezinho favela.</p> <p>While the Tuesday's police operation was similar to previous ones, its scale was unprecedented, said Luis Flavio Sapori, a sociologist and public safety expert at Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais.</p> <p>"What's different about today's operation is the magnitude of the victims. These are war numbers," he said.</p> <p>He argued that these kinds of operations are inefficient because they do not tend to catch the masterminds, but rather target underlings who can later be replaced.</p> <p>"It's not enough to go in, exchange gunfire, and leave. There's a lack of strategy in Rio de Janeiro's public security policy," Sapori said. "Some lower-ranking members of these factions are killed, but those individuals are quickly replaced by others."</p> <p>The Marielle Franco Institute, a nonprofit founded by the slain councilwoman 's family to continue her legacy of fighting for the rights of people living in favelas, also criticized the operation.</p>
<p>"This is not a public safety policy. It's a policy of extermination, that makes the everyday life of Black and poor people a Russian roulette," it said in a statement.</p>

<div class="article-title">Blue Jays even World Series with 6-2 win over Dodgers in Game 4</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>LOS ANGELES — Dodger Stadium was still shaking with joy when Monday turned to Tuesday as the Toronto Blue Jays trudged into their clubhouse. Their 18-inning loss in Game 3 felt like a monumental setback that might have already decided the World Series.</p> <p>That's when Vladimir Guerrero Jr. stepped up and told his team exactly what it needed to hear.</p> <p>For all its drama, Game 3 was no more important than Game 4.</p> <p>"I was the last one to go in," Guerrero said. "I saw everybody with his head down. I said, 'Come on, bro. Head up. It's not over yet. It's not over yet. They gotta win four. Four games. You have to win four games to win the World Series. It's not over.'"</p>
<p>The Jays' leader then backed up his message by crushing another timely homer Tuesday night, this time off Shohei Ohtani.</p> <p>And after nine superb innings played in less than three tidy hours, these profoundly resilient Blue Jays have evened the World Series again.</p> <p>Guerrero hit a two-run homer off Ohtani in the third inning, Shane Bieber pitched four-hit ball into the sixth, and Toronto got back on track with a 6-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>
<p>Addison Barger had two hits and an RBI for the AL champion Blue Jays, who coolly rebounded from their heartbreaking, late-night defeat with stellar work at the plate and on the mound.</p> <p>"Coming off what could be a back-breaking loss last night, it was an absolute pleasure to show up today and see nobody changes," Bieber said. "Nobody ever wavers. Nobody ever hesitates. It's the same group of guys each and every day."</p> <p>By sending the defending champion Dodgers to just their third loss in 14 games this postseason, the Blue Jays reclaimed homefield advantage and guaranteed the World Series trophy will be won at Rogers Centre.</p> <p>"I believe in this team, man," said Guerrero, who spurred the Jays with his seventh homer of the postseason. "This team is something special."</p>
<p>Game 5 is Wednesday at Dodger Stadium, with Game 6 in Toronto on Friday.</p> <p>Ohtani redefined the concept of short rest by taking the World Series mound just over 17 hours after he reached base nine times and smashed four extra-base hits in the Dodgers' stirring victory.</p> <p>He yielded four runs on six hits while pitching six-plus innings with six strikeouts in Game 4. And after Guerrero hit his majestic homer, the Blue Jays tagged Ohtani for two more while chasing him during their four-run seventh.</p> <p>Ohtani couldn't make up for it at the plate, going 0 for 3 with a walk and two strikeouts. He was on deck when the game ended.</p> <p>He didn't have the only poor performance at bat for the powerhouse Dodgers, who mustered just six hits — only one for extra bases.</p> <p>"We're facing quality arms at this time of year against really good teams," Ohtani said through his interpreter. "We're facing the best of the best, so I think it's not that easy. At the same time, we could do at least the bare minimum and put up some runs."</p> <p>The Dodgers' two-way superstar was outpitched by Bieber, the Blue Jays newcomer who returned from Tommy John surgery in late August. The 2020 AL Cy Young Award winner gave up just one run in a resilient World Series debut.</p> <p>An Orange County native with friends and family roaring for him from the loge level at Dodger Stadium, Bieber issued three walks, but repeatedly got out of trouble. He stranded four runners before Mason Fluharty relieved him in the sixth and stranded two more — and the Blue Jays took control moments later with their seventh-inning rally.</p> <p>"I think that we knew it was going to be a great series," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "This team is talented, they're resilient — talking about the Blue Jays — and they came back fighting. Bieber does what he does ... and we really didn't get a whole lot of good swings. Conversely, you see those guys grinding and using the whole field and putting some hits together. We just didn't have an answer."</p>
<p>Ohtani took the mound again 11 days after he hit three homers and struck out 10 Milwaukee Brewers in arguably the greatest single-game performance in baseball playoff history to clinch the NL pennant.</p>
<p>Although his fastball velocity was down to 97.6 mph from his season average of 98.5, Ohtani largely stayed out of trouble with effective breaking stuff.</p> <p>He also drew a six-pitch leadoff walk to reach base for the 11th straight time, extending his World Series record — but he didn't get on base again.</p> <p>The Dodgers scored first for the fourth consecutive game when Kiké Hernández's sacrifice fly brought home Max Muncy in the second. But the Blue Jays finally got to Ohtani in the third, ending their 13-inning scoring drought with a big swing from their star slugger.</p> <p>Nathan Lukes hit a one-out single before Guerrero hammered a misplaced breaking ball from Ohtani over the left-center wall. Guerrero has set Toronto postseason records with seven homers and 14 RBIs this month.</p> <p>"A sweeper is a pitch designed to generate popups, and the swing that Vlad put on it was elite," Toronto manager John Schneider said. "After last night and all the recognition that went into Shohei individually, and he's on the mound today, it's a huge swing from Vlad. It's a huge swing to get us going, and it gives you some momentum."</p> <p>Ohtani retired 11 of 12 after Guerrero's homer, but the Blue Jays chased him with Daulton Varsho's single and Ernie Clement's double off the wall to start the seventh. Toronto scored on Andrés Giménez's single and Ty France's groundout off Anthony Banda before Bo Bichette and Barger added RBI singles off struggling reliever Blake Treinen.</p> <p>Toronto played without ALCS hero George Springer, who left Game 3 in the seventh inning after injuring his right side on a swing.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Up next</h3> <p>Dodgers lefty Blake Snell (3-1, 2.42 ERA) faces Blue Jays rookie Trey Yesavage (2-1, 4.26) in the pivotal Game 5. It's a pitching rematch of the Series opener, when Toronto handed Snell his only loss of a previously dominant postseason by chasing him at the start of a nine-run sixth inning in an 11-4 win. Yesavage pitched four innings of two-run ball.</p>

<div class="article-title">These doctors want to break the cycle of shame and blame in medicine</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The distress that Will Bynum later recognized as shame settled over him nearly immediately.</p> <p>Bynum, then in his second year of residency training as a family medicine physician, was wrapping up a long shift when he was called into an emergency delivery. To save the baby's life, he used a vacuum device, which applies suction to assist with rapid delivery.</p> <p>The baby emerged unharmed. But the mother suffered a severe vaginal tear that required surgical repair by an obstetrician. Soon afterward, Bynum retreated to an empty hospital room, trying to process his feelings about the unexpected complication.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to see anybody. I didn't want anybody to find me," said Bynum, now an associate professor of family medicine at Duke University School of Medicine in North Carolina. "It was a really primitive response."</p>
<p>Shame is a common and highly uncomfortable human emotion. In the years since, Bynum has become a leading voice among clinicians and researchers who argue that the intense crucible of medical training can amplify shame in future doctors.</p> <p>He is now part of an emerging effort to teach what he describes as "shame competence" to medical school students and practicing physicians. While shame can't be eliminated, Bynum and his research colleagues maintain that related skills and practices can reduce the culture of shame and foster a healthier way to engage with it.</p> <p>Without this approach, they argue, tomorrow's doctors won't recognize and address the emotion in themselves and others. And thus, they risk transmitting it to their patients, even inadvertently, which may worsen their health. Shaming patients can backfire, Bynum said, making them defensive and leading to isolation and sometimes substance use.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Blame the patients</h3> <p>The U.S. political environment presents an additional obstacle to changing the culture of shame. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other top Trump administration health officials have publicly blamed autism, diabetes, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and other chronic issues in large part on the lifestyle choices of people with the conditions — or their parents.</p>
<p>For instance, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested in a Fox News interview that more diabetes could be treated with cooking classes instead of "just throwing insulin at people." </p> <p>Even before the political shift, that attitude was reflected at doctors' offices as well. A 2023 study found that one-third of physicians reported feeling repulsed when treating patients with Type 2 diabetes, which is sometimes linked to obesity. About 44% viewed those patients as lacking motivation to make lifestyle changes, while 39% said they tended to be lazy.</p> <p>"We don't like feeling shame. We want to avoid it. It's very uncomfortable," said Michael Jaeb, a nurse at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has conducted a review of related studies, published in 2024. And if the source of shame is from the clinician, the patient may ask, "'Why would I go back?' In some cases, that patient may generalize that to the whole health care system."</p> <p>Indeed, some patients, like Christa Reed have avoided doctors because of this. Reed dropped out of regular medical care for two decades, weary of weight-related lectures. "I was told when I was pregnant that my morning sickness was because I was a plus-size, overweight woman," she said.</p> <p>Except for a few urgent medical issues, such as an infected cut, Reed avoided health care providers. "Because going into a doctor for an annual visit would be pointless," said the now 45-year-old Minneapolis-area wedding photographer. "They would only just tell me to lose weight."</p> <p>Then, last year, severe jaw pain drove Reed to seek specialty care. A routine blood pressure check showed a sky-high reading, sending her to the emergency room. "They said, 'We don't know how you're walking around normal,'" she recounted.</p> <p>Since then, Reed has found supportive physicians with expertise in nutrition. Her blood pressure remains under control with medication. She's also nearly 100 pounds below her heaviest weight, and she hikes, bikes, and lifts weights to build muscle.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">A "masochistic" work ethic</h3> <p>Savannah Woodward, a California psychiatrist, is among a group of physicians trying to bring attention to the detrimental effects of shame and develop strategies to prevent and mitigate it. While this effort is in the early stages, she co-led a session on the spiral of shame at the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting in May.</p> <p>If physicians don't acknowledge shame in themselves, they can risk depression, burnout, sleeping difficulties, and other ripple effects that erode patient care, she said.</p> <p>"We often don't talk about how important the human connection is in medicine," Woodward said. "But if your doctor is burned out or feeling like they don't deserve to be your doctor, patients feel that. They can tell."</p> <p>In a survey conducted this year, 37% of graduating students reported feeling publicly embarrassed at some point in medical school, and nearly 20% described public humiliation, according to an annual survey by the Association of American Medical Colleges.</p> <p>Medical students and physician residents are already prone to perfectionism, along with an almost "masochistic" work ethic, as Woodward described it. Then they're run a gantlet of exams and years of training, amid constant scrutiny and with patients' lives on the line.</p> <p>During training, physicians work in teams and make presentations to teaching faculty about a patient's medical issues and their recommended treatment approach. "You trip over your words. You miss things. You get things out of order. You go blank," Bynum said. And then shame creeps in, he said, leading to other debilitating thoughts, such as "'I'm no good at this. I'm an idiot. Everyone around me would have done this so much better.'"</p> <p>Yet shame remains "a crack in your armor, that you don't want to show," said Karly Pippitt, a family medicine physician at the University of Utah who has taught medical students about the potential for shame as part of a broader ethics and humanities course.</p>
<p>"You're taking care of a human life," she said. "Heaven forbid that you act like you're not capable or you show fear."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Stop the shame cycle</h3> <p>When teaching students about shame, the goal is to help future physicians recognize the emotion in themselves and others, so they don't perpetuate the cycle, Pippitt said. "If you felt shamed throughout your medical education, it normalizes that as the experience," she said.</p> <p>Above all, physicians-in-training can work to reframe their mindset when they receive a poor grade or struggle to master a new skill, said Woodward, the California psychiatrist. Instead of believing that they've failed as a physician, they can focus on what they got wrong and ways to improve.</p> <p>Last year, Bynum started teaching Duke physicians about shame competence, beginning with roughly 20 OB-GYN physician residents. This year, he launched a larger initiative with The Shame Lab, a research and training partnership between Duke University and the University of Exeter in England that he co-founded, to reach about 300 people across Duke's Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, including faculty and physician residents.</p> <p>This sort of training is rare among Duke OB-GYN resident Canice Dancel's peers in other programs. Dancel, who completed the training, now strives to support students as they learn skills such as how to suture. She hopes they will pay that approach forward in "a chain reaction of being kind to each other."</p> <p>More than a decade after Bynum experienced that stressful emergency delivery, he still regrets that shame kept him from checking on the mother as he usually would following delivery. "I was too scared of how she was going to react to me," he said.</p> <p>"It was a little devastating," he said, when a colleague later told him that the mother wished he had stopped by. "She had passed a message along to thank me for saving her baby's life. If I had just given myself a chance to hear that, that would have really helped in my recovery, to be forgiven."</p>

<div class="article-title">Senate Republicans deal Trump a rare rebuke on trade with vote against Brazil tariffs</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The Republican-led Senate on Tuesday delivered a rare bipartisan rebuke of President Trump in a vote to terminate the emergency powers he has used to set tariffs on Brazil, part of a larger push to rein in the administration's efforts to install trade barriers.</p> <p>By a vote of 52 to 48, the Senate approved a measure that would roll back the 50% tariffs on Brazil imposed by President Trump in July. Five Republicans joined with Democrats to pass it: Susan Collins of Maine, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Kentucky's Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul.</p>
<p>The success of the resolution, which needed just a simple majority to pass, may only prove symbolic. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is unlikely to bring the measure up for a vote in the House, and even if he did President Trump would almost certainly veto it.</p> <p>Still, the vote marked a test of support for the president's tariff policies among Republicans, reflecting unease inside the party about their impacts on the U.S. economy, and specifically the farming and manufacturing sectors. It came ahead of arguments at the Supreme Court this fall in a case challenging Trump's authority to put sweeping tariffs in place using emergency powers.</p>
<p>Tuesday's vote was the first of three planned by Democrats and a handful of Republicans aimed at rolling back the president's tariff policies. Later this week, the Senate is expected to take up similar votes to reverse tariffs on Canada and other nations.</p> <p>One of the lawmakers behind the push is Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the lead sponsor of the measure approved Tuesday. Ahead of the vote, Kaine told reporters the effort highlights the tariffs' stark impacts on the U.S. economy in recent months.</p> <p>"They're about the economic destruction of tariffs, but they are also really about how much will we let a president get away with?" Kaine asked. "Do my colleagues have a gag reflex or not, in terms of powers that constitutionally are handed to Congress?"</p>
<p>The five Republicans who broke ranks did so despite a last minute lobbying push by Vice President JD Vance, who met with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday and urged them to back the president's policies. Vance told reporters after the lunch meeting that the tariffs are critical leverage for Trump in international negotiations.</p> <p>To block the president's emergency powers to set tariffs, "is to strip that incredible leverage from the president of the United States," Vance told reporters outside the meeting room near the Senate chamber. "I think it's a huge mistake, and I know most of the people in there agree with me."</p>
<p>The vote took place as President Trump is in Asia for a multi-nation trip where trade talks are a top focus.</p> <p>Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said Vance told Republicans that Trump is essentially on a trade mission.</p> <p>"It's successful, and it's bringing in a lot of revenue," Hawley said about the trip as he explained his opposition to the measure. "I'm supportive of the president's tariff policy."</p>
<p>Not all Republicans were convinced. Tillis said after the meeting he would vote to limit the tariffs.</p> <p>"I just don't think there's a rational basis for it," Tillis said. "If you start allowing that … that creates a big uncertainty in the business community."</p> <p>Trump triggered the Brazil tariffs this summer to pressure the country's government to end what he called a "witch hunt" against his ally, former far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Last month, Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup to stay in power following his 2022 election defeat.</p> <p>The vote wasn't the first time Senate Republicans have broken with Trump on tariffs. In April, a measure to block tariffs on Canada drew a simple majority of the Republican-led Senate as a handful of G.O.P senators joined Democrats to push the measure across the finish line. Kaine and Paul co-sponsored the measure, and McConnell, Collins and Murkowski voted in favor.</p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Websites fashioned like online marketplaces match aspiring farmers with land owners who want to pass their property to someone who will be a good steward of their work. It's part of a growing trend.</p>
</div>
<div aria-label="Transcript" class="transcript storytext">
<b class="icn-story-transcript-wrap">
</b>
<p>JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: </p><p> Farmers are increasingly posting in online marketplaces or taking out personal ads to find buyers for their land. Programs in several states help farmers do this when they don't have a relative or friend to pass the farm on to. Sophia Saliby of member station WKAR reports.</p><p>SOPHIA SALIBY, BYLINE: For most of his adult life, Thomas Lodge has been involved in agriculture, studying botany, creating a mushroom wholesale business and building an organic farm outside of Detroit. A few years ago, he wanted to focus on his mushroom business full time but didn't want to completely give up the farm.</p><p>THOMAS LODGE: I kind of built up the brand and was in some markets and got the organic certification. So I was really looking for somebody that kind of shared the same vision as me.</p><p>SALIBY: So he made a post on an online platform in Michigan called MIFarmLink, which connects landowners with farm-seekers and found Simon Yevzelman. He and his wife wanted to launch new livelihoods in agriculture and were excited about finding Lodge's property.</p><p>SIMON YEVZELMAN: It's one in a billion that a turnkey farm was available 30 minutes from our door in Dearborn Heights.</p><p>SALIBY: This is the second year the Yevzelmans have grown vegetables, flowers, mushrooms and herbs to sell to customers on the land that they lease from Lodge.</p><p>YEVZELMAN: This bed is green onion and lettuce that are just coming in. We've got carrot, two more beds of radish. Got some snap peas.</p><p>SALIBY: MIFarmLink program manager Jill Dohner says the way Lodge and the Yevzelmans found each other is becoming more common.</p><p>JILL DOHNER: Historically speaking, farmers used to just give their land to their sons or their daughters, and they would take over the operation. That's not happening anymore.</p><p>SALIBY: She says that issue is exacerbated as more of the country's farmers get older. And she says for many of them, the land they own is like a piece of them, which makes passing it on, especially to someone new, a tough personal process.</p><p>DOHNER: Most farmers want that land to go to a deserved farmer, somebody who can actually, you know, take it and do good for the land.</p><p>SALIBY: MIFarmLink aims to make that initial introduction easier. Yevzelman says the concept is easy to grasp.</p><p>YEVZELMAN: It's great. It's just like any other online marketplace where people can share, you know, supply and demand.</p><p>SALIBY: On the website, people share what they're looking for, whether it's land for sale or lease or a mentorship. And then they inject a little personality into their posts, like this one - small-town gardening girl looking to expand her farm. Or there's another about a family of grow-getters who are looking to farm around and find out. The concept behind these programs, what's known as land or farm linking, goes back several decades. Shemariah Blum-Evitts is the executive director for Land For Good, which manages a farm-linking program in New England. It launched more than a decade ago.</p><p>SHEMARIAH BLUM-EVITTS: We're not growing any more land. So maintaining what we have available and making sure it continues to be there for future generations is going to be really key.</p><p>SALIBY: There are currently several dozen farm linking programs active in more than 30 states. After operating in several individual counties in Michigan, MIFarmLink is going statewide this month, with more than 300 farm-seekers already signed up. One of them is Maureen Maccomb, who wants to farm for the first time.</p><p>MAUREEN MACCOMB: I kind of feel like farming has been, like, this well-kept secret, like, kind of passed down from generations, and if you're not in it, it's really hard to figure out how to break in it.</p><p>SALIBY: Her dream property for her family - several acres where they can grow produce and flowers and maybe raise some goats and chickens. Maccomb says she's in the early stages of connecting with a farmer that will hopefully get her closer to that dream.</p><p>For NPR News, I'm Sophia Saliby in East Lansing.</p>

<p>AILSA CHANG, HOST: </p><p> After more than 500 days under siege, the Sudanese army's last stronghold in Darfur, the city of El Fasher, has fallen to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. The RSF has previously been accused of genocide by the U.S., and as Kate Bartlett reports, there have already been reports of atrocities and ethnic cleansing since they overran the city on Sunday.</p><p>KATE BARTLETT, BYLINE: The RSF has been celebrating a major battlefield victory.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED RSF SOLDIER #1: (Non-English language spoken).</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOTS)</p><p>BARTLETT: General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who heads the Sudanese Armed Forces, admitted government troops had left the city after their base was overrun by the paramilitary.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>ABDEL FATTAH AL-BURHAN: (Non-English language spoken).</p><p>BARTLETT: After 2 1/2 years of civil war, the RSF and allied Arab militias now control all of Darfur, the remote western region where their forebearers, the Janjaweed, perpetrated a genocide against mainly African ethnic groups some two decades ago. Now there are well-founded fears that history is about to repeat itself.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED RSF SOLDIER #2: (Non-English language spoken).</p><p>BARTLETT: Videos already circulating amongst monitoring and human rights groups, which NPR cannot independently verify, show grinning militia men shooting detainees and chasing fleeing civilians while shouting racial slurs.</p><p>KHOLOOD KHAIR: What this points to is that the genocide that we saw 20 years ago is actually still continuing.</p><p>BARTLETT: Kholood Khair, a Sudanese analyst, says there's potential for more violence this time round. It's already started.</p><p>SHAYNA LEWIS: Satellite imagery shows us that the RSF is going house to house in some neighborhoods of El Fasher in cleansing operations, and expert analysts think that they can see the bloodstains from space.</p><p>BARTLETT: Shayna Lewis is Sudan specialist with advocacy group Avaaz. She says early estimates indicate at least 1,000 civilians have already been killed.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>MOHAMED DUDA: I appreciate your efforts to update the news about El Fasher.</p><p>BARTLETT: One of these was Mohamed Duda, a spokesperson for the Zamzam displacement camp near El Fasher who survived an attack on the camp by the RSF in April where they slaughtered hundreds. He's spoken to NPR before and was in touch as recently as last week.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>DUDA: I'm so glad to be in touch with you. I will share with you every day news update if you want.</p><p>BARTLETT: Now he's dead. RSF fighters, blatantly unconcerned about chances of future prosecution, frequently film their crimes and post them on the internet, Lewis says.</p><p>LEWIS: Residents of El Fasher who previously left the city are finding out about the deaths of their loved ones through footage of executions that are widely circulating on social media.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOTS IN DISTANCE)</p><p>BARTLETT: The war over which side gets to run the resource-rich nation that sits at the vital crossroads between the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea has killed tens of thousands and displaced 14 million. Both sides have been accused of atrocities, but it has not been happening in a vacuum. There are multiple international players involved. The United Arab Emirates is accused of backing the RSF, something the UAE denies.</p><p>CAMERON HUDSON: This victory for the RSF allows it to consolidate total control over one-third of the country, all of Darfur.</p><p>BARTLETT: The taking of El Fasher will only give it more leverage, says Cameron Hudson, former special envoy to Sudan.</p><p>HUDSON: That will bolster its claims that it's a government and demand greater and better treatment for itself at any future negotiating table.</p><p>BARTLETT: With the latest RSF gain, there's a possibility the country could split not just in half, but into numerous territories. In the meantime, the RSF appears intent on pursuing a scorched-earth policy in El Fasher, a city of some 250,000 people, with the real extent of the atrocities likely only to become clear in the weeks ahead.</p><p>For NPR News, I'm Kate Bartlett in Johannesburg.</p>

<div class="article-title">Want to opt out of AI? State labeling laws might help</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Utah and California have passed laws requiring entities to disclose when they use AI. More states are considering similar legislation. Proponents say labels make it easier for people who don't like AI to opt out of using it.</p> <p>"They just want to be able to know," says Utah Department of Commerce executive director Margaret Woolley Busse, who is implementing new state laws requiring state-regulated businesses to disclose when they use AI with their customers.</p> <p>"If that person wants to know if it's human or not, they can ask. And the chatbot has to say."</p> <p>California passed a similar law regarding chatbots back in 2019. This year it expanded disclosure rules, requiring police departments to specify when they use AI products to help write incident reports.</p>
<p>"I think AI in general and police AI in specific really thrives in the shadows, and is most successful when people don't know that it's being used," says Matthew Guariglia, a senior policy analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which supported the new law. <strong>"</strong>I think labeling and transparency is really the first step."</p> <p>As an example, Guariglia points to San Francisco, which now requires all city departments to report publicly how and when they use AI.</p> <p>Such localized regulations are the kind of thing the Trump Administration has tried to head off. White House "AI Czar" David Sacks has referred to a "state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem."</p> <p>Daniel Castro, with the industry-supported think tank Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation, says AI transparency can be good for markets and democracy, but it may also slow innovation.</p> <p>"You can think of an electrician that wants to use AI to help communicate with his or her customers ... to answer queries about when they're available," Castro says. If companies have to disclose the use of AI, he says, "maybe that turns off the customers and they don't really want to use it anymore."</p> <p>For Kara Quinn, a homeschool teacher in Bremerton, Wash., slowing down the spread of AI seems appealing.</p>
<p>"Part of the issue, I think, is not just the thing itself; it's how quickly our lives have changed," she says. "There may be things that I would buy into if there were a lot more time for development and implementation."</p> <p>At the moment, she's changing email addresses because her longtime provider recently started summarizing the contents of her messages with AI.</p> <p>"Who decided that I don't get to read what another human being wrote? Who decides that this summary is actually what I'm going to think of their email?" Quinn says. "I value my ability to think. I don't want to outsource it."</p> <p>Quinn's attitude to AI caught the attention of her sister-in-law, Ann-Elise Quinn, a supply chain analyst who lives in Washington, D.C. She's been holding "salons" for friends and acquaintances who want to discuss the implications of AI, and Kara Quinn's objections to the technology inspired the theme of a recent session.</p> <p>"How do we opt out if we want to?" she asks. "Or maybe [people] don't want to opt out, but they want to be consulted, at the very least."<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">How to decide whether to step back from a difficult relationship — or stick it out</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>You have a strained relationship with your father, but he recently developed health issues and needs someone to care for him. You don't feel emotionally fulfilled in your marriage, but you've been with your partner for 10 years. You've made a new friend who's nice most of the time, but is mean when she's angry.</p>
<p>Should you step back from these relationships or stick them out?</p> <p>These are the kinds of dilemmas that therapist KC Davis tackles in her book published earlier this year, <em>Who Deserves Your Love: How to Create Boundaries to Start, Strengthen or End Any Relationship</em><em>. </em>It offers practical advice on how to move forward when relationships with family members, romantic partners or friends become difficult.</p> <p>The book features a flowchart that Davis calls "The Relationship Decision Tree." It consists of questions that Davis asks clients when their loved ones are behaving in a way that bothers them. It helps them "make decisions about whether to lean into this relationship or disengage," she says.</p>
<p>Davis, author of the best-selling book <em>How to Keep House While Drowning</em>, talks through a few questions adapted from her framework.</p>
<h2 class="edTag"><strong>Why is this behavior objectionable to you? </strong></h2> <p>This question can help you pinpoint exactly what's "bothering you about a person you love," Davis says, because often there are many reasons. Parsing through the "why" can help you decide how to proceed.</p> <p>Let's say your roommate isn't doing their chores. Ask yourself what annoys you specifically about that behavior, Davis says. Is it just something you don't like, or is it actually hurtful or harmful?</p> <h2 class="edTag"><strong>Are they willing to change? </strong></h2> <p>Once you start digging deeper, you might find that those dirty dishes in the sink "actually directly impacts me negatively," Davis says. Maybe they're starting to attract bugs.</p> <p>Your next move is to have a conversation with your roommate. Are they willing to change their behavior? They may not do things exactly your way, so work on a solution together. Maybe you strike a deal where they cook and you clean, or they commit to doing the dishes before the end of the night.</p>
<h2 class="edTag"><strong>Does staying in this relationship violate my values?</strong></h2> <p>Your most important values are your physical safety, your psychological safety and the physical and psychological safety of minor children, Davis says. "If I cannot meet those responsibilities, then it's against my values to continue in this relationship."</p> <p>You may have other core values as well, like the safety of a dependent parent or sibling, or the keeping of your sobriety.</p> <h2 class="edTag"><strong>Would <em>leaving</em> this relationship violate my values? </strong></h2> <p>What happens if staying in the relationship doesn't violate your values, but you <em>still </em>don't want to maintain the relationship?</p>
<p>"This is where it gets really unique to you and the relationship," Davis says. Think about what you feel you owe the relationship and consider your history. How long have you known the person? What are your obligations and responsibilities to them?</p> <p>"If I was stood up by a first date, I'm not obligated to give that person a second chance," Davis says. "But if my mom stood me up for lunch, it would probably be against my values to say, 'that's it, I'm never speaking to you again.'"</p> <h2 class="edTag"><strong>If I want to disengage, what could that look like? </strong></h2> <p>Let's say it doesn't go against your values to leave the relationship. And so you end up deciding to disengage. How do you do that, exactly?</p> <p>Davis says every scenario will be different, so take a moment to think about how you want to handle the situation in ways that protect your values.</p> <p>Disengaging from a marriage, for example, might mean getting a divorce — but it could also mean being platonic co-parents living in the same house.</p> <p>Disengaging from your parents might mean cutting them off and never talking to them again — but it could also mean only seeing them on holidays, she says.</p> <p>Disengaging from a friend might mean you stop talking to them all together, but it could also mean that you stop making one-on-one plans with them, but stay in the same social circle, she says.</p> <p>Whatever you decide, give yourself permission to step back from the relationship. And remember, this doesn't have to be a permanent decision. It can be something you do temporarily as you tend to your wellbeing, Davis says.</p> <h2 class="edTag"><strong>If I want to maintain the relationship, how could I do so with boundaries? </strong></h2> <p>You might decide to stay in a relationship without disengaging because you feel like you have a responsibility to that person. Or, you might decide you're fulfilled by the relationship in certain ways and it's meaningful to you to maintain it.</p>
<p>In that case, it will be important to create boundaries, or rules you set up for yourself to protect your physical and psychological wellbeing, Davis says.</p> <p>Let's say your dad, who has dementia, is verbally abusive, she says. Your boundary might be to visit him once a week, then call a person whom you love and trust to debrief with you after the visit.</p>
<p>Or maybe you're fed up with your partner who goes cycling for six hours every Saturday and isn't doing his fair share of the housework, she says. Your boundary might be to limit doing his chores for him by hiring a housekeeper.</p> <p>The idea here is to "not try to get them to change, but learn how to take care of yourself in the backend," she says.</p> <p><strong><em>If you or a loved one is experiencing intimate partner violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1 800 799-SAFE.</em></strong></p> <p><em>The digital story was edited by Meghan Keane, with art direction by Beck Harlan.

<div class="article-title">How Israel is winning the wars and losing the peace</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>TEL AVIV — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently stood next to President Trump in Israel's parliament in Jerusalem and summarized the last two years of war:</p> <p>"Israel achieved amazing victories over Hamas and the entire Iran terror axis — Sinwar, Deif, Haniyah, Nasrallah, Assad — they're all gone." </p> <p>This list refers to countries (Iran, Syria and Lebanon), groups (Hamas and Hezbollah) and individuals (Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyah of Hamas, Hassan Nasrallah of Hezbollah and Bashar al-Assad of Syria) that have been Israel's main enemies for decades.  </p> <p>Yet at the same time, "While Netanyahu was winning wars, he was not able to win any of the peace, or any of the peaces," said Paul Salem, who's based in Lebanon with the Middle East  Institute. "He was not able to turn his military victories into sustainable political wins. He was digging Israel deeper into a hole."</p>
<p>Israel has also come under withering international criticism. This is mostly over the Gaza war, which began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which Israeli authorities say killed 1,144 people. In its ferocious response, Israel's military killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza health officials.</p>
<p>Israel faces charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice, and Netanyahu has been charged with war crimes at the International Criminal Court. Israel and Netanyahu reject both these charges.</p> <p>For Israel, "From a purely military perspective, things look much better. From a foreign policy perspective, things could not have deteriorated much more than they have," said Chuck Freilich, a former deputy national security advisor in Israel.</p> <p>"I think the war had a long-term impact," he added.  "It's going to take quite a while for Israel to regain its international standing of, let's say, 30 or 40 years ago." </p> <p>Back in the 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians spent much of the decade trying to negotiate an end to their conflict, with the international community supporting those efforts.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Friction in Israel-U.S. ties</h3> <p>Today, the criticism of Israel comes from all directions. Outrage in the Arab world. Mass protests in European cities and on U.S. college campuses.</p>
<p>Yet Freilich says his biggest worry is the U.S.-Israel relationship, which he has seen from both sides. He was born and raised in the U.S. He moved to Israel, where he became a security official. He still lives in Israel, but teaches for a semester each year in the U.S., currently at Georgetown University. </p> <p>"For me, this is really the only existential threat that Israel faces, is a loss of American support," he said. "Israel needs the United States critically for just about every issue it faces."</p> <p>Israel used to have rock-solid bipartisan support in the U.S. </p> <p>"Today there is an absolute collapse of support on the Democratic side, and we see the beginnings of a decrease in support on the Republican side," he said. </p> <p>Trump remains a staunch supporter of Israel, but he has set red lines. He's pressuring Israel to stick to the ceasefire. He's explicitly told Israel not to annex the West Bank, where a half-million Jewish settlers live on land Palestinians claim for a future state.</p> <p>Salem says with these actions, Trump is showing a willingness to go against Israel in ways that previous U.S. presidents have not.</p> <p>"He doesn't always seem to follow what Israel or the Israeli lobby or the prime minister of Israel wants," said Salem. </p> <p>Before the Gaza war erupted in 2023, some younger Arabs were not as passionate about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as earlier generations, which championed the Palestinian cause since the first major war in 1948. </p> <p>The latest Gaza war has energized the younger generation, said Salem.</p> <p>"This is a war that was carried live on TikTok, and that did not happen in 1948," he said. "This has branded an entire generation."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Relations cool, but agreements hold</h3> <p>The recent fighting was also a stress test of the Abraham Accords. Those are the 2020 agreements worked out in Trump's first term, which established relations between Israel and four Muslim countries.</p>
<p>The war produced strains, but the agreements survived, notes Erel Margalit, a prominent Israeli venture capitalist who began doing business in Gulf states after the accords were signed.</p> <p>"We have companies that are dealing with [United Arab Emirates] banks and Bahrain banks and Saudi banks and insurance companies and the government," he said. </p> <p>Speaking more broadly about Israel-Arab business ties, which had largely stalled in the past couple  years, he said, "It's not being discussed too much out in the open. It's not being hidden, but it's quiet. I think a lot of it is coming back." </p> <p>However, an improvement in Israel's international standing is likely to take time.  </p> <p>What the region needs, said Margalit, are Israeli and Arab political leaders who can move beyond the endless cycle of conflict.</p> <p>"There needs to be more political leadership, because the region could certainly use new initiatives as we're moving forward from this war," he said. </p> <p>A lot may depend on what happens next in Gaza. If the ceasefire holds and rebuilding starts in Gaza, then Israel's isolation may begin to ease.</p> <p>But the ceasefire remains shaky. On Tuesday, Israel accused Hamas of firing on Israeli forces still in Gaza. Netanyahu ordered "forceful strikes" in response, and Palestinian officials reported air strikes in Gaza City late Tuesday night. </p>
