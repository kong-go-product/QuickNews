      "content": "<html><body><div><section class=\"content__body\">\n<p>Jimmy Kimmel <span class=\"link\">returned to his</span> long-running late-night show Tuesday, less than a week after network broadcaster ABC pulled \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" over remarks he made about <span class=\"link\">the assassination</span> of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. </p><p>\"It's been overwhelming...I've heard from all the people in the world over the last six days,\" Kimmel joked to open his monologue, going on to thank all those who came out in his defense, including conservatives. </p><p>\"Most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,\" Kimmel said. \"I never would have imagined that Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, even my old pal Ted Cruz, who believe it or not said something very beautiful on my behalf. It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration. They did and they deserve credit for it.\"</p><p>The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, had announced Monday that Kimmel would return to the air. </p><p>It followed a political and media firestorm that began after the comedian addressed Kirk's slaying in a Sept. 15 monologue, saying: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"</p>\n\n<p>An emotional Kimmel on Tuesday said that \"it's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it,\" noting that he had taken to social media following Kirk's killing to send his condolences to Kirk's family. </p><p>Kimmel didn't issue a blanket apology for his monologue remarks last week, but said he understood how it was offensive to some. </p><p>\"Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual,\" Kimmel said of the suspected gunman. \"That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make. But I understand that to some, that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both. And for those who think I did, point a finger, I get why you're upset. If the situation was reversed, there's a good chance I'd have felt the same way.\"</p><p>Kimmel gave a brief explanation for what took place behind the scenes between himself and ABC's brass.</p>\n\n<p>\"I was not happy when they pulled me off the air on Wednesday,\" Kimmel said. \"I did not agree with that decision, and I told them that, and we had many conversations. I shared my point of view, they shared theirs. We talked it through, and at the end, even though they didn't have to, they really didn't have to, this is a giant company…they welcomed me back on the air.\"</p><p>On Tuesday night, before the show aired on the East Coast, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled!\" </p><p>He went on, \"I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars,\" Mr. Trump said in reference to his defamation lawsuit last year against ABC News over remarks made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, which the network <span class=\"link\">settled in December</span> by agreeing to contribute $15 million to Mr. Trump's presidential foundation and museum, and another $1 million toward Mr. Trump's legal fees.</p><p>\"This one sounds even more lucrative,\" Mr. Trump wrote Tuesday. \"A true bunch of losers!\"</p><p>Kimmel told his audience Tuesday that the president \"made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke.\"</p><p>\"One thing I did learn from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern, is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like, is anti-American,\" he added. </p><p>In a Sept. 17 interview with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr called Kimmel's remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" Carr told Johnson. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"</p><p>Within hours of that interview, station operator Nexstar announced it would preempt Kimmel's show over the remarks. Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, <span class=\"link\">for $6.2 billion</span>, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it. </p><p>A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision to preempt Kimmel's show was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"</p><p>ABC later said that it was \"indefinitely\" suspending the show. </p><p>Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.</p><p>Despite its return to ABC on Tuesday night, both Nexstar and Sinclair said they would <span class=\"link\">continue to preempt</span> Kimmel's show.</p><p>Sinclair on Monday night posted a statement on X saying it will preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be \"replacing it with news programming\" beginning Tuesday night. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" Sinclair said. </p>\n\n<p>Nexstar on Tuesday said it will continue to preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"monitor the show as it returns to ABC.\"</p><p>Regarding Carr, Kimmel on Tuesday showed the audience a social media post that the FCC chair wrote in May 2022 in which he said, \"Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while using humor to draw more people in to the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.\"  </p> <p>Disney on Monday did not delve into the details of what led to its decision to allow Kimmel's show to resume, only saying in a statement that the initial suspension was \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" calling his comments \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"</p><p>\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.</p><p>The temporary removal of Kimmel's show sparked a nationwide debate over issues of free speech and censorship. Many in the Hollywood community rallied to Kimmel's side, with more than 400 celebrities — including actors Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep — signing an open letter with the American Civil Liberties Union that criticized the move as \"a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.\"</p><p>Conservatives upset with Kimmel's comments about Kirk praised the decision, including President Trump, who congratulated ABC on his Truth Social platform \"for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\" </p><p>Mr. Trump <span class=\"link\">also speculated</span> last week whether networks that cover him negatively should have their broadcast licenses revoked. </p>\n\n<p>\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" the president told reporters on Sept. 18. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"</p><p>But one prominent conservative, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, was specifically critical of Carr's comments to Johnson. </p><p>\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas,'\" <span class=\"link\">Cruz said</span> Friday on his podcast. \"That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it.'\" </p><p>Kimmel's show, which launched in 2003, tapes in front of a studio audience on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. The guests for Tuesday's show included actor Glen Powell and singer Sarah McLachlan. </p>\n<p class=\"content__meta--contributors\">\nJoe  Walsh, \n                                                  \n                                  Aimee  Picchi, \n                                                  \n                                  Kathryn  Watson and \n                                                  \n                                  Mary  Cunningham\n                  \n        contributed to this report.\n    </p>\n\n</section>\n</div></body></html>"

But the machine ground to a halt almost immediately, forcing both Trumps to start climbing the stairs on their own, videos of his arrival show.</p><p>Later, as Mr. Trump began his speech to the General Assembly, he remarked that his teleprompter wasn't working. \"I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,\" the president said, drawing laughs from the audience.</p><p>The president brought up the two mishaps later in his speech, framing them as metaphors for what he views as the incompetence of the United Nations — which he accused of offering up little more than \"empty words.\"</p><p>\"All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that, on the way up, stopped right in the middle. If the first lady wasn't in great shape, she would've fallen,\" the president said. \"These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter.\"</p>\n<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later floated a different explanation, writing in a post on X: \"If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately.\"</p>\n\n<p>Leavitt shared a screenshot from a Times of London article that reported U.N. workers had been overheard joking they might intentionally shut off escalators during Mr. Trump's visit and blame funding shortfalls. There is no evidence that U.N. staff followed through on those jokes.</p><p>The press secretary later told Fox News that the Secret Service is looking into the matter.</p><p>\"When you put all of this together, it doesn't look like a coincidence to me,\" Leavitt said on Fox News' \"Jesse Watters Primetime.\" \"And if we find that these were U.N. staffers who were purposefully trying to trip up, literally trip up, the president and the first lady of the United States, well, there better be accountability for those people.\"</p><p>However, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday the escalator may have suddenly stopped because of a videographer from the U.S. delegation who can be seen walking ahead of the president and first lady on the escalator, seemingly to film their arrival.</p>\n\n<p>\"A subsequent investigation, including a readout of the machine's central processing unit, indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator. The safety mechanism is designed to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing. The videographer may have inadvertently triggered the safety function described above,\" Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, said in a statement.</p><p>Separately, a U.N. official told CBS News that the White House operated the teleprompter for Mr. Trump when it malfunctioned during his speech. </p><p>A federal law enforcement source confirmed to CBS News that the Secret Service is looking into the matter.</p><p>CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.</p><p>Mr. Trump's speech came as his second administration distances itself from the U.N., withdrawing the U.S. from agencies like the Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization. The administration has also cut its financial contributions to the U.N. and criticized its approach to Israel.</p><p>\"The U.N. has such tremendous potential,\" the president said in his speech, \"but it's not even coming close to living up to that potential.\"</p>\n<p class=\"content__meta--contributors\">\nAaron  Navarro\n                  \n        contributed to this report.\n    </p>\n\n</section>\n</div></body></html>"

Russia occupies large parts of eastern Ukraine, including territories captured in 2014 and in the current war that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>Asked later Tuesday by Fox News' Bret Baier if he was surprised by the U.S. president's about-face, Zelenskyy laughed and responded, \"a little bit.\"</p><p>Zelenskyy said he and Mr. Trump had a positive conversation on Tuesday, and he believes Mr. Trump's position on territorial swaps has changed.</p>\n\n<p>\"I think he understands for today that we can't just swap territories.

The Kremlin has <span class=\"link\">pushed Zelenskyy</span> to fully withdraw from large swaths of eastern Ukraine, an idea Zelenskyy has rejected as unfair and unconstitutional.

He <span class=\"link\">met with Putin in Alaska last month</span>, but he has criticized the Russian leader for continued strikes on Ukraine, and said last week that Putin had \"really let me down.\"</p><p>The U.S. president also pressed NATO countries earlier this month to stop buying Russian oil and to impose hefty tariffs on China, which has remained aligned with Russia, writing that those moves could \"be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR.\"</p><p>Separately, Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he believes NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter their airspace, after <span class=\"link\">Russian drones entered Poland</span> earlier this month and <span class=\"link\">Russian fighter jets allegedly entered Estonian airspace</span>.</p><p>At other points, though, Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy have had a rocky relationship. An Oval Office meeting between the two leaders earlier this year <span class=\"link\">descended into a shouting match</span>, and Mr. Trump has occasionally blamed Zelenskyy for the war.</p><p>During his interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said he believes his relationship with his American counterpart has improved.</p><p>\"I think we have better relation[s] than before,\" Zelenskyy said. \"I think we didn't have close relation[s] because we didn't have, maybe, time.

      "content": "<html><body><div><section class=\"content__body\">\n<p>A Florida jury on Tuesday found <span class=\"link\">Ryan Routh</span> guilty of an assassination attempt against then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. </p><p><span class=\"link\">Routh represented himself</span> in the trial. He was found guilty of all five charges, which included attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate and assaulting a federal officer. </p><p>Routh was arrested in September 2024 at Mr. Trump's golf course. A Secret Service agent testified last week that he spotted Routh before the then-presidential candidate came into view. Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot, the agent said.</p><p>After the verdict was read, Routh apparently tried to harm himself, possibly using a pen that was on his desk, to stab himself in the neck. His daughter cried out during the incident and U.S. marshals eventually tackled him. </p><p>It was the second assassination attempt against Mr. Trump in 2024, after shots were fired in a separate incident at a Pennsylvania rally. A bullet grazed Mr. Trump's ear in that incident. </p>\n\n<p>Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the guilty verdict against Routh \"illustrates the Department of Justice's commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence,\" and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the verdict sends \"a clear message\" that an \"attempt to assassinate a presidential candidate is an attack on our Republic and on the rights of every citizen.\" </p><p>A federal district judge will determine his sentence. He faces life in prison.</p><p>In a nearly hourlong closing argument on Tuesday, Routh said that there was no intent to kill because the trigger was never pulled, the gun was never fired and that no one was hurt, so \"no crime.\"  </p><p>\"I wanted to kill, my actions within the community and toward my co-workers and family should show my obvious non-violence and gentleness,\" Routh said. Speaking about himself in the third person, he said the shooting was never going to happen because it was \"never in his heart.\" </p>\n\n<p>But prosecutors said Routh spent weeks plotting to kill Mr. Trump, who was then running for president. Prosecutors laid out Routh's actions ahead of the incident, saying \"those aren'tcoincidences … that's a plan,\" prosecutor Christopher Brown said in his closing argument. </p><p>\"He had a loaded round in the chamber and the safety off,\" Brown said. \"We don't have to prove motive, but you already have it. You only have to decide intent.\" </p><p>Prosecutors also alleged in court filings that Routh attempted to acquire an anti-aircraft weapon to <span class=\"link\">shoot down Mr. Trump's plane</span>.</p><p>Routh had initially submitted a witness list that included Mr. Trump, as well as Columbia activists Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi — to whom his connections are unclear — and several prominent authors. Judge Aileen Canon had rejected many of these potential witnesses.</p><p><em>Jacob Rosen, Daniel Shepherd and The Associated Press contributed to this report. </em></p>\n\n</section>\n</div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><section class=\"content__body\">\n<p><span class=\"link\">Robot umpires</span> are getting called up to the big leagues next season.</p><p>Major League Baseball's 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System in the major leagues in 2026.</p><p>Human plate umpires will still call balls and strikes, but teams can challenge two calls per game and get additional appeals in extra innings. Challenges must be made by a pitcher, catcher or batter — signaled by tapping their helmet or cap — and a team retains its challenge if successful. Reviews will be shown as digital graphics on outfield videoboards.</p><p>Adding the robot umps is likely to cut down on ejections. MLB said 61.5% of ejections among players, managers and coaches last year were related to balls and strikes, as were 60.3% this season through Sunday. The figures include ejections for derogatory comments, throwing equipment while protesting calls and inappropriate conduct.</p><p>Big league umpires call roughly 94% of pitches correctly, according to UmpScorecards.</p>\n<p>ABS, which utilizes Hawk-Eye cameras, has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019. The independent Atlantic League trialed the system at its 2019 All-Star Game and MLB installed the technology for that year's Arizona Fall League of top prospects. The ABS was tried at eight of nine ballparks of the Low-A Southeast League in 2021, then moved up to Triple-A in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, Fred DeJesus became the first umpire in a regular-season game to use ABS. He remembers the first pitch he tested – it was a strike – and how he was hesitant about the new technology at first.</p><p>\"Initially, it was like, no way, we're not doing this. I spent way too much money trying to learn the craft of calling balls and strikes,\" he <span class=\"link\">told CBS News</span> in 2021.</p><p>At Triple-A at the start of the 2023 season, half the games used the robots for ball/strike calls and half had a human making decisions subject to appeals by teams to the ABS.</p><p>MLB switched Triple-A to an all-challenge system on June 26, 2024, then used the challenge system this year at 13 spring training ballparks hosting 19 teams for a total of 288 exhibition games. Teams won 52.2% of their ball/strike challenges (617 of 1,182) challenges.</p>\n\n<p>At Triple-A this season, the average challenges per game increased to 4.2 from 3.9 through Sunday and the success rate dropped to 49.5% from 50.6%. Defenses were successful in 53.7% of challenges this year and offenses in 45%.</p><p>ABS was used in this year's All-Star Game as well and has generally received positive reviews, CBS Sports reported. Four of five challenges of plate umpire Dan Iassogna's calls were successful in July.</p><p>Teams in Triple-A do not get additional challenges in extra innings. However, the proposal approved by the MLB on Tuesday included a provision granting teams one additional challenge each inning if they don't have challenges remaining.</p><p>MLB has experimented with different shapes and interpretations of the strike zone with ABS, including versions that were three-dimensional. Currently, it calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone is 53.5% of batter height and the bottom 27%.</p><p>This will be MLB's first major rule change since sweeping adjustments in 2024. Those included a pitch clock, restrictions on defensive shifts, pitcher disengagements such as pickoff attempts and larger bases.</p><p>The challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers. While there was concern that full-blown ABS would make some strong defensive catchers obsolete, not everyone considers the skill a good thing.</p><p>\"The idea that people get paid for cheating, for stealing strikes, for moving a pitch that's not a strike into the zone to fool the official and make it a strike is beyond my comprehension,\" former manager Bobby Valentine said.</p>\n\n<p>Texas manager Bruce Bochy, a big league catcher from 1978-87, maintained old-school umpires such as Bruce Froemming and Billy Williams never would have accepted pitch framing. He said they would have told him: \"'If you do that again, you'll never get a strike.' I'm cutting out some words.\"</p><p>Management officials on the competition committee include Seattle chairman John Stanton, St. Louis CEO Bill DeWitt Jr., San Francisco chairman Greg Johnson, Colorado CEO Dick Monfort, Toronto CEO Mark Shapiro and Boston chairman Tom Werner.</p><p>Players include Arizona's Corbin Burnes and Zac Gallen, Detroit's Casey Mize, Seattle's Cal Raleigh and the New York Yankees' Austin Slater, with the Chicago Cubs' Ian Happ at Detroit's Casey Mize as alternates. The union representatives make their decisions based on input from players on the 30 teams.</p><p>Bill Miller is the umpire representative.</p><p>The competition committee can unilaterally implement on-field rule changes with 45 days' notice to the MLB Players Association, according to CBS Sports. </p>\n</section>\n</div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><section class=\"content__body\">\n<p>Infection rates from drug-resistant \"nightmare bacteria\" rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.</p><p>Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in an article published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said. </p><p>Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.</p><p>\"The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,\" said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.</p><p>It's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said. </p>\n\n<p>That may play out in doctors' offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat — like urinary tract infections — could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report's authors.</p><p><span class=\"link\">Antimicrobial resistance</span> occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise — unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn't kill the germs made them stronger.</p><p>In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to \"<span class=\"link\">nightmare bacteria</span>\" resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.</p><p>Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.</p>\n\n<p>They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.</p><p>The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 — an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460%, the authors said.</p><p>A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>\"We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance,\" said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.</p><p>The CDC's count is only a partial picture. </p><p>Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren't able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.</p><p>The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections \"is definitely underestimated,\" Burnham said.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the first study to report a rise. A CDC report published in June noted an increase in NDM cases in New York City between 2019 and 2024. </p>\n</section>\n</div></body></html>"
