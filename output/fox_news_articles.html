                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>King Charles III’s former butler, who served the monarch for seven years, said he was surprised by Prince Harry’s claims in "Spare."</p><p>Grant Harrold has written a memoir, "The Royal Butler: My Remarkable Life in Royal Service," where he details his time working with and befriending King Charles and Queen Camilla. The etiquette expert told Fox News Digital he was stunned when he first read Harry’s 2023 memoir, where the Duke of Sussex described his struggles with royal life.</p><p>"I’ve openly talked about this because … his memories and mine are very different," said Harrold. "You think we [were] in two different households because I talked about this happy family … with his stepmother and everything. He’s saying he didn’t. I never witnessed that."</p><p>"I saw some magazine [clippings] the other day … from the king’s wedding," said Harrold. "When you look at these pictures of Harry around his stepmother, both leaving Windsor and chasing after the cars, that’s not somebody who’s unhappy. If he was really that unhappy, I know people who wouldn’t even go to weddings or wouldn’t even get involved because they’re unhappy. And I was there the night before. There was a dinner for [Prince] William, Harry and the king. ... it was a lovely occasion … There were no issues."</p><p>A spokesperson for Archewell, which handles the office of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, previously told Fox News Digital they would not be commenting on Harrold’s book.</p><p>In "Spare," Harry describes in detail his sibling rivalry with his brother William, heir to the British throne, and the death of their mother. In the opening chapter, Harry wrote that his father, then Prince Charles, broke the news of his mother’s accident but didn’t hug his son. He also wrote that he and William both "begged" their father not to marry Camilla, worried she would become a "wicked stepmother."</p><p>Harrold stressed he never witnessed any unhappiness from Harry during his time as a working royal. The Duke of Sussex and his wife stepped back as senior royals in 2020 and moved to California. The couple cited the unbearable intrusions of the British press and a lack of support from the palace as their reasons for leaving.</p><p>It's unknown if the father of two simply kept his private thoughts about his royal life to himself until now, Harrold noted.</p><p>"With mental health, you sometimes have no idea someone is unhappy about anything," said Harrold. "He could have been pretending. … I’m not saying he’s not [sincere], but all I know is there was no evidence of him being unhappy at all or suffering from any kind of mental health issues. But it’s a silent thing, so it’s possible. But nobody knew."</p><p>"My memories are definitely very different from his," said Harrold. "It’s almost as if it were a different household, but it wasn’t. That was his household, it was his home. And it’s where I spent a lot of time as well." </p><p>"It’s interesting because the queen said, ‘recollections may vary,’" Harrold continued. </p><p>"She talked about that toward the end of her life about the situation. And it’s true. My memories and Harry’s are obviously very different. It’s up to people to read my book and make their own minds about it. But I think … if they read what I’ve put, look at press clippings or any TV footage from back in the day, they can then make their minds up. And I think it’ll be quite obvious that something, as I keep saying, doesn’t add up."</p><p>In televised interviews before the publication of "Spare," Harry accused Camilla of leaking private conversations to the media to improve her reputation, The Associated Press reported. He said members of the royal family got "into bed with the devil" to gain favorable tabloid coverage. He singled out Camilla’s efforts to rehabilitate her image after her longtime affair with his father.</p><p>"That made her dangerous because of the connections that she was forging within the British press," Harry, 41, told CBS. "There was open willingness on both sides to trade information. And with a family built on hierarchy, and with her on the way to being queen consort, there was gonna be people or bodies left in the street."</p><p>Buckingham Palace never publicly responded to Harry’s book.</p><p>Harrold worked in the king’s household from 2004 to 2011. He was invited to Charles and Camilla’s wedding in 2005 as a guest.</p><p>"At the end of the festivities, Charles and Camilla were catching a flight to head straight to Birkhall," he recalled in his book. "We all went outside to wave them off and laughed as we saw William and Harry had decorated their car with ‘Just Married.’ As they drove off through the arches to cheers, the boys raced after the car, followed by the media."</p><p>Harrold described Charles as a "fantastic father," a doting parent who looked after his sons after they lost their mother, Princess Diana, in a tragic accident. The late Princess of Wales died in 1997 from injuries in a Paris car crash. The princes were 15 and 12 years old at the time.</p><p>"A lot of people assume that he wasn’t hands-on, or he wasn’t around," Harrold explained to Fox News Digital. </p><p>"Yes, his duties were very different, especially after the divorce, to what Princess Diana was doing. But equally, they both made time for the boys. They both were hands-on, they both did things in their own way. Diana might have taken them to a water park, for example, but the king would [also] take them up to Balmoral to do a bit of shooting or fishing in the countryside, which they loved."</p><p>"Both parents brought something very different to the table, but the boys liked that," said Harrold. "I think their characters have been shaped by both parents and grandparents. I was talking about Harry the other day, and someone said, ‘He comes across as being quite stubborn.’ I said, ‘Well, you could say that’s from his grandfather, Prince Philip… because his grandfather was quite stubborn. His mother stood her ground. You could argue that side as well. But this is what’s great about them."</p><p>"William’s got a bit of shyness and a bit of quietness, which comes from his mother and, to a degree, from his father," Harrold continued. </p><p>"But when I was there, I did witness a father who was hands-on. He was very funny with them. He was very sweet with them. And he definitely tried to fill a gap, 100 percent. He was trying to fill that space their mother’s death had left. He was definitely trying, not to replace her, but to fill that space."</p><p>Harrold said he remains grateful for his experience working at the palace and for witnessing another side of the royals.</p><p>"I suppose the thing that surprised me was probably … how normal he is," said Harrold, referring to the king, 76. </p><p>"Like everybody else … you see them, you read stuff, and you hear stuff. And we all make up our minds about what those people are like. And they always say, don’t meet your idols because it’s not what you imagine. But luckily for me, meeting this family that I followed throughout my childhood and teenage years, it was exactly what I hoped they would be."</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Young conservatives are reflecting on how Charlie Kirk inspired them to boldly and unashamedly stand up for their beliefs.</p><p>Fox News Digital attended the Texas Youth Summit in The Woodlands, Texas, to speak with attendees about the legacy Kirk leaves behind following his assassination.</p><p>"Charlie Kirk was one of the first people who got me into politics," said Fred, a college student and the Vice Chair of Special Affairs for the Young Conservatives of Texas. "I started watching when I was a freshman in high school a few years ago. And Charlie... he was my inspiration for getting involved on campus at [Southern Methodist Univerity]." </p><p>Braelunn from Montgomery, Texas, said, "I believe that the assassination of Charlie Kirk was not only an attack on someone I watched, and I adored, but is an attack on my First Amendment right."</p><p>Paul, who is originally from California but now resides in Houston, said he was familiar with Kirk's work as the founder of Turning Point USA, but in the wake of the assassination, he got to know his story better.</p><p>"Since what's happened last week, I think I've got to learn more about his life and his legacy, and he's almost even more of an inspiration now," he said.</p><p>Shaylin, originally from Canada, shared how Kirk was a model to her. </p><p>"Charlie Kirk is someone who I've been watching for 10 years in my life, and he has been the one that has showed me what it looks like to live a radical life of being grounded in morals and truth and what it means to be even bold in your faith," she said.</p><p>Natalie attends Austin College, which she described as very liberal, but Kirk's legacy inspired her to not fear speaking out. </p><p>"He has helped in encouraging me to speak up about my beliefs and have civil discussions with people who may not agree with you and, even if the person that disagrees with you, backlashes with violence or aggressive insults or cursing, obviously, to keep it respectful," Natalie told Fox News Digital. </p><p>Following the assassination of Kirk, these young conservatives said they are more determined than ever to share their views openly.</p><p>Noel, a student at Dallas Baptist University, said, "I do not think they are safe on campus, but as a believer and as a fellow conservative myself, I think conservatives now more than ever are bolder and standing for what they believe in, despite the fact that they know that they are in trouble. And it's sad that we've gotten to that point."</p><p>However, Noel shared the importance of being bold in your values. </p><p>"We're standing up bolder, stronger, more than we've ever known…  As Christians, we're guaranteed that persecution in this life, but that's part of the cost, and we know that," he told Fox News Digital. "We were prepared for that, and I think truly now we understand that it's there, but we also understand that our mission is greater and the consequences that could happen."</p><p>Ella, a student at Lone Star College, said, "So in the past, I used to be kind of nervous, but I mean, I have God in my life and I know I'm going to be spreading His word in my politics and in the way that He has shaped my life and who I am as a person, and I'm not afraid of anybody, the only person I'm afraid of is God."</p><p>Will, a Young Conservatives of Texas state board member, said he's troubled by where the country is heading.</p><p>"I think a lot of schools are going to start putting in more security," Will said. "We're taking it a lot more serious now. Never before in America did you have to worry about getting shot for your opinions, but now we're there, I guess. It's sad."</p><p>Fred added that his school, Southern Methodist University, is working to keep students safe and is confident about other campuses in the Lone Star State. </p><p>"I'm sure administrators across the state of Texas and across the nation can see that and will work with their students and conserve these awards to make sure that students are safe," he said.</p><p>Paul said following the assassination of Kirk, he is anticipating a similar response for college safety to the response that 9/11 had on airport security. </p><p>Braelunn said, "I truly, I hope that it changes safety. I hope there should be no person, right or left, no matter which side of the spectrum you're on, that should feel threatened for expressing their beliefs."</p><p>Noel said he felt encouraged to continue his mission.</p><p>"The whole situation has definitely been hard," he said. "But at the same time, to see a leader like that who died for something you truly believed in encourages me to go even harder. So the mission keeps going."</p><p><i>Fox News' Alba Cuebas-Fantauzzi contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump will highlight the "return of American strength" in his second administration during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly Tuesday, while delivering "blunt" and "tough talk" about the "failures of globalism," a White House official told Fox News Digital.</p><p>The president is scheduled to deliver his first address of his second administration at the UN General Assembly in New York City Tuesday just before 10 a.m.</p><p>A White House official gave Fox News Digital an exclusive preview of the president’s address.</p><p>"President Trump has effectively restored American strength on the world stage," a White House official told Fox News Digital. "His historic speech at the United Nations General Assembly will highlight his success in delivering peace on a scale that no other president has accomplished, while simultaneously speaking bluntly about how globalist ideologies risk destroying successful nations around the world."</p><p>The president is expected to highlight his successful efforts to negotiate peace around the world—specifically, Armenia and Azerbaijan; Thailand and Cambodia; Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; among others.</p><p>The president is also expected to highlight his strikes against narcoterrorists from Venezuela.</p><p>Earlier this month, a U.S. military strike blew apart a Venezuelan drug boat in the southern Caribbean, leaving nearly a dozen suspected Tren de Aragua narcoterrorists dead. And last week, the president announced that the U.S. military had carried out its second kinetic strike on Venezuelan drug trafficking cartels.</p><p>Also last week, the president announced that he ordered a lethal strike on a vessel allegedly linked to a designated terrorist organization conducting narcotrafficking in the U.S. Southern Command’s area of responsibility. That strike left three narcoterrorists dead.</p><p>"Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage en route to poison Americans," Trump posted to his Truth Social announcing the strike.</p><p>The president is also expected to highlight his "Operation Midnight Hammer," which marked the largest B-2 operational strike in history and represented the United States’ move to deliver a decisive blow against Iran’s nuclear program back in June.</p><p>Trump’s historic precision strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites hit their targets and "destroyed" and "badly damaged" the facilities’ critical infrastructure—an assessment agreed upon by Iran’s Foreign Ministry, Israel, and the United States.</p><p>Trump is also set to detail his work to "deliver historic peace deals in decades-long conflicts," the official told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Meanwhile, the president’s speech will also feature "some blunt, tough talk about the failures of globalism."</p><p>"This will include the global migration regime, energy and climate, and how these ideologies pushed by globalists are on the verge of destroying successful nations," a White House official told Fox News Digital.</p><p>The president is also expected to discuss America’s position as a "defender of western civilization."</p><p>"As the president delivers peace in major conflicts around the world, what has the United Nations been doing?" the official said.</p><p>After his speech at the United Nations, the president is expected to have meetings with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy; the president of Argentina, Javier Milei; and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.</p><p>The president is also scheduled to have a multilateral meeting with leaders from Qatar, Jordan, Turkey, Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia.  </p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> One of the lawyers who successfully defended New York City subway hero Daniel Penny is calling out what he terms the "dysfunctional homicidal policies of the radical left," arguing that progressive criminal justice policies that keep violent, mentally ill repeat offenders on the streets lead to preventable tragedies like the recent Charlotte train stabbing in North Carolina.</p><p>"These are homicidal policies," said Thomas Kenniff, a partner at Raiser Kenniff &amp; Lonstein. "If you are unwilling to support criminal justice policies that where circumstances require you have the incarceration or institutionalization of violently dangerous people, understand you're making a choice and you're standing for something that is going to get innocent people like this poor young woman in Charlotte, killed."</p><p>Decarlos Brown Jr., a 34-year-old with a history of mental illness and more than a dozen prior charges, allegedly stabbed 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska in the neck from behind in an unprovoked attack on a light rail train on Aug. 22, according to authorities.</p><p>He was released without bail for a prior misdemeanor charge of allegedly misusing the 911 system.</p><p>"The alleged assailant in this case, my understanding is at least 14 arrests, prior psychiatric commitments, jail sentences — he was able to walk out of that courtroom with, you know, signing a note, 'I promise to come back,'" Kenniff told Fox News Digital. "Daniel Penny, after having served his country for four years in the Marine Corps, attending college, no prior criminal record... we had to post $100,000 bond."</p><p>Kenniff has long warned that the persecution of Penny would put a chilling effect on other potential good Samaritans, who not only have to worry about their personal safety when intervening to stop a violent crime, but may also be afraid of being targeted by left-wing prosecutors.</p><p>Jurors found Penny not guilty of criminally negligent homicide in December, after he put a mentally ill man named Jordan Neely, 30, in a chokehold on a subway car. Neely had schizophrenia, was behaving erratically, high on drugs and threatening riders. He died after the encounter.</p><p>Zarutska, the Charlotte victim, was a refugee who came to the U.S. after fleeing the war in her native Ukraine. Video shows she collapsed to the ground and bled out in front of at least a half-dozen bystanders in an unprovoked stabbing. She was on her way home from work at a pizzeria, looking at her phone from a seat on the train when video shows a man in red open a pocket knife behind her immediately before the stabbing.</p><p>While police statistics show major crimes, including homicides, are on the decline, Kenniff said they don't paint a full picture.</p><p>"The only statistic that should matter is how many preventable, otherwise preventable crimes are occurring," he told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Kenniff noted that even Brown's family wanted him off the streets before the stabbing.</p><p>"From what I've read, his own mother tried to commit him involuntarily and had a judge, whose job it is to uphold the law and collateral to that obviously protect the public, release that person on a note that they'll come back to court," he told Fox News Digital. "And [to] not look at that as a man-made preventable crime — that did not need to occur."</p><p>Brown faces first-degree murder in North Carolina as well as a federal charge of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system.</p><p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday that the Justice Department will seek the maximum penalty for Brown, saying that the Aug. 22 attack was a "direct result of failed soft-on-crime policies that put criminals before innocent people."</p><p>"We will seek the maximum penalty for this unforgivable act of violence," she said. "He will never again see the light of day as a free man."</p><p>Republican lawmakers in North Carolina have also proposed a bill to change how judges set bail and bond, according to the Charlotte News &amp; Observer newspaper.</p><p>The proposed bill, Iryna's Law, would make it harder for people accused of violent crimes to get pretrial release and imposes stricter conditions on them if they make bond. It would also expand the state's authority to have mentally ill people forcibly committed.</p><p><i>Fox News' Sarah Rumpf-Whitten contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

"I thought that was quite a lot."</p><p>The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority recently released its numbers for July visitors, noting a 12% drop from last year.</p><p>There were 3,089,300 visitors to the city that month compared to over 3.5 million for the same period last year, while occupancy on the Strip dropped 7% from 86.5% in 2024, according to the same source.</p><p>Katherine from College Station, Texas, along with her daughter, Cammie, were celebrating the teen's 16th birthday in Vegas this city. </p><p>"Having a coffee that was $14 was crazy," said Katherine. "I just wasn't expecting that. It was just a latte with a few extra flavors," she added. </p><p>"I got a drink this morning. It was like $12 for a lemonade or something like that," said Cammie. "And water bottles are so expensive."</p><p>Janice and Faith tagged along to Vegas with their husbands, who were attending a conference.</p><p>Janice said she was a bit shocked at her $18 breakfast at Starbucks.

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>"How do we cover that?"</p><p>That had to have been the topic on the table at the Monday morning meeting of news network executives, producers and hosts, and probably will be today and for at least a week to come.  </p><p>I hope the producers and hosts have the courage to call it what it was: the most watched Christian service of witness and forgiveness, mourning and testimony as has ever been watched and listened to in history. </p><p>Look past the more than 100,000 people who attended in person and began to line up outside of Phoenix’s State Farm Stadium before dawn, a stadium which filled to the acceptable capacity of 70,000 and left tens of thousands in an adjacent arena or watching on their cellphones. </p><p>I haven’t seen any estimates of U.S. audience or online views, much less the international reach or the audience for clips during the days of echoing that will follow in the virtual world. The numbers will be enormous if there is even any way of compiling them. </p><p>That Sunday would be a unique day of mourning was already widely understood by the end of last week. President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth would be the biggest names among the eulogists, along with the heartfelt tributes of Charlie’s friends and colleagues, teachers (Dr. Larry Arnn, president of Hillsdale College) and older mentors, (Dr. Ben Carson, elder statesman of the politically active evangelical conservative community) and of course, his colleagues at Turning Point USA plus an extraordinary musical backdrop from the world of Christian ministry and superb production values from a tested TPUSA team used to big events. </p><p>But what how will the media describe it?</p><p>Having dipped in and out of covering faith in America since 1990, with a couple of books and documentaries on the subject and a PBS series in 1996, "Searching for God in America," I’m well aware that America’s newsrooms are not overflowing with journalists accustomed to the language of evangelical Christianity of any kind. </p><p>I’m multilingual when it comes to Christianity, describing myself for decades as an evangelical Roman Catholic Presbyterian, as I am a faithful member of Pope Leo XIV’s legions and an ordained elder in the Presbyterian Church, (U.S.A.) — one river, two banks and I’m welcomed on both. I’m just a "mere Christian" as C.S. Lewis put it. Not a theologian, but a lawyer-journalist who has covered world religions and made an effort to keep up with doctrinal arguments within my own, arguments which have consumed most of the past few decades. </p><p>More than 60% of Americans identify as Christians, according to Pew Research Center’s 2023-2024 survey. The world is currently home to more than 2.5 billion Christians. Whatever one makes of the faith, it is the primary shaping force of Western civilization. Whatever one makes of Christianity’s truth claims, Charlie and the vast majority of those who watched Sunday believe them, as I do. </p><p>But, much of post-modern media lacks basic fluency in the language used by many of the speakers Sunday. The vice president and secretaries of State and War made explicit testimonies to their belief in the objective truth of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. </p><p>Trump underscored Charlie’s role as an evangelist. </p><p>Erika Kirk made a heart-breaking and deeply moving public forgiveness of her husband’s assassin —perhaps the hardest of all Christian commandments which Jesus laid down in his famous Sermon on the Mount: "I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven." </p><p>At that moment, Erika Kirk was modeling the words of the first Christian martyr, St. Stephen, as he prayed for his persecutors, even as Jesus did for the Romans crucifying him in Jerusalem 2000 years ago. </p><p>So what is the impact going to be of Charlie’s murder and of his evangelical witness amplified by Sunday and a hundred or a thousand other commentaries like this one?</p><p>I don’t know and it would be foolish to guess. Here is an example of why. </p><p>The Christian view is a large one and its timelines are not "news cycles." This year, for example, I had occasion to worship in an old Baptist church in Maine that had commissioned George Dana Boardman —"Apostle to the Karens" (yes, an actual ethic group in Myanmar) in 1825. </p><p>Boardman and his wife took ship to Calcutta 200 years ago, then on to what was then deemed Burma, learned the language for two years and spent three to four years evangelizing the people before George died of tuberculosis. An unremarkable life of a forgotten Christian missionary? Hardly. </p><p>There are hundreds, if not thousands, of "Karen congregations" around the world because of a missionary’s efforts 200 years ago. The Karen Baptist Convention (KBC) is a major denomination in Myanmar and a reliable source for figures there. More than a decade ago, the KBC included 1,829 churches with a membership of over 287,000 in Myanmar with hundreds more congregations in Thailand. There are hundreds of such churches in the US alone. George Boardman’s mission was unnoticed by most at the time. I doubt even many American Baptist Church folk know of him today. Religious "coaching trees" are very difficult to trace. But they are everywhere. </p><p>Point being: Nobody has any idea what Charlie’s life and his memorial service will mean in the hearts and minds of millions who watched it and how their lives will change as a result and thus change the lives of others. </p><p>But reporting on the size of the outreach is a start and asking authorities on faith for their assessment is so much more interesting and compelling than trying to smash the story into a "political" or "cultural box." </p><p>The "world-wide religious impact" box of stories doesn’t get taken off the shelf very often — deaths of popes and conclaves are one of the few occasions that come to mind — but, the uniqueness of the Christian celebration of the life of Charlie Kirk ought to draw the attention of serious people. </p><p>There are hundreds of experts on whom networks and news platforms of all sorts can rely who are close at hand: Dr. Albert Mohler, Bishop Robert Barron, former Senator Ben Sasse and perhaps even Pope Leo XIV could be approached for assessment and comment.  </p><p>What I expect is that most news organizations will flee the scene or force it into a political moment because Charlie was assassinated for overtly political causes in a time of increasing political violence. </p><p>But the "story" is one that Christians routinely refer to as "the greatest story ever told" and one which we believe to be objectively true. Bravo to the outlets with the courage to grapple with the most consequential part of Charlie Kirk’s life: His impact on the infinite timeline of millions of human souls. </p><p><i>Hugh Hewitt is host of "The Hugh Hewitt Show," heard weekday mornings 6am to 9am ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>CNN’s Abby Phillip said Saturday that liberals need to "actively acknowledge" their role in pushing cancel culture and censorship if they want the nation to move forward.</p><p>The "Table for Five" host and her panel discussed ABC’s suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel after he made controversial comments regarding Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin, which triggered backlash from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and two major broadcast affiliate owners. </p><p>Though Phillip criticized Republicans for celebrating despite their push for free speech, she agreed with another panelist who argued liberals have been, by contrast, "too censorious" in the past. </p><p>"I think that’s something more liberals should say," Phillip said. "I think it would help. They should acknowledge, not just in passing, but actively acknowledge where things went wrong. That’s the only way to move forward, I think, in a way."</p><p>When asked what liberals should admit, Phillip said they must recognize that cancel culture was an issue before Kimmel’s suspension.</p><p>"It was actually a thing, and it’s not just enough to say, well, my cancel culture was fine, but yours is wrong," Phillip said. "There has to be an acknowledgment that, yeah, now I think everybody understands what free speech really looks like and what it means, and then you have to apply that thinking to what was happening four, five, six years ago in this country and say something about it."</p><p>CNN political commentator and former Biden official Ashley Allison disagreed with Phillip, saying that, unlike Republicans, a Democratic president did not attempt to "cancel" somebody.</p><p>"Joe Biden wasn’t canceling somebody, Kamala Harris wasn’t canceling. It might’ve been individual citizens, and individual citizens actually have the ability to say, ‘I don’t like it’ and let their dollars, let their viewership, let their subscriptions [decide]," Allison said.</p><p>Liberals and media commentators have attacked ABC and parent company Disney’s decision to suspend Kimmel’s show, claiming that they had capitulated to the Trump administration and its FCC to silence a Trump critic.</p><p>Though some conservative commentators celebrated Kimmel’s suspension, others expressed caution about potential government overreach.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The deadly stabbing of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte’s light rail last month demonstrates everything President Donald Trump has warned about violent crime.</p><p>The 34-year-old suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., had previously been arrested an astonishing 14 times. This career criminal, however, had been free to roam the streets thanks to Democrats controlling law enforcement in Charlotte at every level. Victims like Zarutska are sacrificed when crime goes unpunished. </p><p>As President Donald Trump’s transportation secretary, I've seen firsthand how leadership can transform chaos into order. From building an all-new air traffic control system to cleaning up D.C.’s Union Station, we've proven American decline isn’t inevitable; it’s a choice. Nowhere is this clearer than in the fight against crime. So I formally launched an investigation into the Charlotte transportation authorities’ safety and security plans. But we’re not just looking at North Carolina.</p><p>Anarchy has infected transit networks everywhere. Americans see it every day. But Trump’s decisive actions in Washington, D.C., demonstrate how, with the right policies, we can reclaim our cities from the grip of disorder. We will not sit by and wait for the next Iryna. That’s why today, I’ve also reminded leaders in Boston and Chicago that federal dollars come with strings attached. If local leaders want federal funding, they will meet federal safety standards. The status quo is unacceptable. America’s patience has run out.</p><p>Just last month, the president declared an emergency in our nation's capital, surging federal law enforcement officers to restore public safety. It was a direct response to skyrocketing crime rates that turned D.C. into a symbol of urban failure under years of Democratic mismanagement. By tapping agencies like the FBI, DEA and U.S. Marshals, and even deploying the National Guard, Trump showed crime isn't unstoppable — it's a policy failure to be reversed.</p><p>The results speak for themselves: within weeks, violent crime dropped, encampments cleared and even D.C.'s Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser admitted the federal presence has helped. Trump's approach underscores a fundamental truth: crime and urban decay are choices. Leftist policies which prioritize criminals over victims — defunding police, lax prosecution and tolerance for open-air drug markets — have turned once-vibrant cities into war zones.</p><p>Homelessness, too, isn't just a social ill; it's exacerbated by the same permissive attitudes that allow tents to block sidewalks and public parks to become havens for addiction and disorder. Trump's surge in Washington proves cracking down on debauchery and prioritizing public order can turn the tide.</p><p>Even some Democrats are starting to realize this reality. Take Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, whose state has been plagued by Baltimore crime. For weeks, Moore sparred with the president over offers to send in the National Guard, calling the president's rhetoric "performative" while waving off federal help. Yet, just days ago, Moore did an about-face, ordering additional state police into Baltimore to fight local crime. He welcomed support from agencies like the FBI but drew the line at the Guard — perhaps to save face politically. Baltimore is a prime example of how blue-city policies have failed: high homicide rates, rampant drug use and homelessness that spills into streets, driving businesses and families away. Moore's move, while belated, implicitly concedes Trump's point: on-the-ground reinforcements work. If a leftist like Moore can admit the truth, why can't others?</p><p>It's time for accountability. Trump's surge in D.C. isn't just a win for the capital; it's a blueprint for the nation. Governors like Moore are quietly adopting it because the American people have been force-fed blue pills long enough. Minorities are not falling for the routine lie that crime cannot be lowered, while Republicans who are trying to fix the problem are unrepentant racists. There’s a reason Trump nearly doubled his support among Black voters last fall and increased the Hispanic share by a third since 2020. They are waking up and liberal politicians had better wake up soon. Blue-state leaders must choose: continue enabling chaos, or follow Trump's lead and make safety a priority. Our cities deserve better than excuses. They deserve action.</p><p>As we rebuild America's infrastructure under this administration, let's remember that safe streets are the foundation of prosperity. Crime is a blue pill choice — and it's one we can reject.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Do Democrats really want to repeat their humiliating defeat of 1988? They might if they continue putting criminals ahead of citizens. President Donald Trump will make sure of it.</p><p>President Trump, whose political instincts are excellent (witness his turns serving fries at McDonald’s or driving a garbage truck during last year’s campaign), is pushing clueless Democrats into a trap. By sending the National Guard into Washington, D.C., and cleaning up our nation’s capital, he has shown what is possible. By resisting his offers to help their cities, Democratic officials in Illinois, California, New York and other blue states are telling their residents they care more about criminals than the people they represent. They will pay for that.</p><p>In the presidential election of 1988, Republican George H.W. Bush crushed his Democratic rival, winning 426 Electoral College votes to Michael Dukakis’ 111 — one of the worst drubbings of all time.</p><p>Bush portrayed his rival as soft on crime. The Republican nominee ran an infamous and highly effective TV ad saying Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis "…allowed first-degree murderers to have weekend passes from prison." One example that was highlighted was Willie Horton, who murdered a boy in a robbery, stabbing him 19 times. Despite a life sentence, Horton received 10 weekend passes from prison. Horton fled, kidnapped a young couple, stabbing the man and repeatedly raped his girlfriend. The ad concluded: "Weekend prison passes — Dukakis on crime."</p><p>Some say the ad, which also featured a chilling photo of Horton, changed the course of criminal justice in America, leading to more than a decade of ‘tough on crime’ policies.</p><p>Bill Keller, editor-in-chief of The Marshall Project, a group dedicated to criminal justice reform, said the ad "taught Democrats that this was an issue where they had to be more Catholic than the Pope; tougher than tough." </p><p>Six years later, President Bill Clinton followed through by signing the 1994 Crime Bill, which called for nearly $10 billion to build more prisons and add 100,000 police officers. The bill was largely written by Delaware Democrat, then-Sen. Joe Biden. </p><p>Democrats have forgotten the lesson of 1988. They argue that after a spike during the post-COVID years, crime is down, but voters aren’t buying it. A recent AP poll shows two-thirds of Americans think crime is a major problem. Some 81% see it as a major concern in cities, including 96% of Republicans and even 68% of Democrats.</p><p>Bottom line: After decades of backing crime-busting policies and watching the number of violent offenses drop, Democrats have gone soft again.</p><p>Led by former President Joe Biden, they have worked to reverse the impact of the 1994 bill, endorsing cashless bail, shielding juveniles from being charged as adults for even the most heinous crimes, and allowing petty criminals to get off scot-free.</p><p>Some, like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, also advocate closing prisons. Asked in 2020 whether he thought prisons were obsolete, then-New York state Assemblyman Mamdani replied: "I think that frankly — I mean — what purpose do they serve? I think that we have to ask ourselves that." </p><p>Newsom has already closed four prisons in California and wants to shutter a fifth, despite more than two-thirds of voters approving Proposition 36, a measure demanding tougher treatment and longer sentences for certain crimes.</p><p>Democratic officials in cities like New York make it nearly impossible for cops to do their jobs, discouraging law enforcement by releasing repeat offenders back onto the streets, all but encouraging them to reoffend.</p><p>The breakdown of law and order is promoted by judges who side with criminals and district attorneys who refuse to prosecute crimes. Judges like New York’s Jeffrey Gershuny, an appointee of Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio, recently released—defying prosecutors’ requests—a criminal on parole who had already been arrested 34 times for robbery. Thirty-four! And D.A.s like Alvin Bragg, who, on his first day in office, published a long list of offenses he would ignore, including fare-skipping, trespassing, resisting arrest and prostitution.</p><p>In protesting Bragg’s announcement, the head of New York’s police union said, "There are already too many people who believe that they can commit crimes, resist arrest, interfere with police officers and face zero consequences."</p><p>Democrats are committing the gravest of political sins: not listening to their voters. In Chicago, Brandon Johnson was elected mayor two years ago in a race dominated by concerns about safety; 71% of voters listed crime as their top issue, far outranking jobs or anything else. Despite his previous "defund the police" rhetoric and promises to cut law enforcement spending, Johnson won.</p><p>Today, he and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker are refusing President Trump’s offer to help rein in Chicago’s horrific crime. Johnson recently argued, "Jails and incarceration and law enforcement is a sickness that has not led to safe communities." No wonder he has the lowest approval rating of any mayor in the U.S.</p><p>He’s not alone in sounding foolish. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, says committing a crime does not make someone a criminal, while colleague Rep. Jamie Raskin. D-Md., says he opposes Trump’s crackdown because "crime has always been part of our history." Does that comfort the victims?</p><p>In 2028, the GOP candidate for president could well repeat history by running an ad showing the horrifying murder of Iryna Zarutska, the Ukrainian refugee who sought safety in the United States only to be fatally stabbed by suspected assailant Decarlos Brown Jr. Brown had been arrested at least 14 times and had served time for crimes including felony larceny, armed robbery and assault. He also has a history of mental illness.</p><p>Voters will ask: Why was he not locked up? Why did Zarutska have to die because woke judges and prosecutors prioritized their social justice crusade over her life? </p><p>Just as in 1988, Democrats will have no answers.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>In the end, Disney and ABC had absolutely no choice but to rehire Jimmy Kimmel.</p><p>The reason the late-night host is returning to the air tonight is that this whole thing has been an utter PR debacle for ABC, and more personally for Disney chief Bob Iger, who even got whacked by his predecessor as CEO, Michael Eisner, accusing him of bowing to "out-of-control intimidation."</p><p>I don’t think I’m going out on a limb in saying that Iger’s reputation is shattered forever.</p><p>The company became the poster child as a high-profile opponent of free speech — a deadly label for a news organization like ABC.</p><p>So the "indefinite" suspension is over.</p><p>I could sniff that things were moving in this direction when I learned the two sides were talking. And when Disney asked Kimmel for a second meeting the other day, I knew the only question was which day he’d be back.</p><p>Let’s revisit the dumb and inaccurate comment that got Kimmel in trouble. And remember, like Stephen Colbert, he is so vociferously anti-Trump that he surrendered half his audience:</p><p>"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them."  </p><p>First, it was beyond tone-deaf, with feelings rubbed so raw over Charlie Kirk’s assassination. And the killer is not "MAGA," just another crazed lunatic who said he was acting out of "hatred" for Kirk, but also sympathetic to gays and transgender people like his roommate and romantic partner.</p><p>At the same time, there was pressure from the FCC, with Chairman Brendan Carr blundering by saying he would act on Kimmel if ABC didn’t. Even Carr’s allies, like Ted Cruz, said he sounded like a mob boss by declaring "we can do it the easy way or the hard way."Nice little network you got here – be a shame if anything happened to it. Carr walked it back the next day.</p><p>What Kimmel said wasn’t the worst thing ever uttered on the air, and maybe in a month it would have passed unnoticed. But not so soon after the targeted assassination.</p><p>With that kind of blatant government pressure, ABC caved and took Kimmel off the air as he was about to tape last Wednesday’s show – and was said to be preparing an even tougher monologue about the Kirk killer. Again, he failed to read the electronic room.</p><p>It was downhill from there.</p><p>For anyone who believes in free speech – and that includes some Democrats who don’t agree with Kirk on just about anything–Disney and ABC were now the enemy.</p><p>Howard Stern, Kimmel’s closest friend – their families vacation together – said yesterday he had canceled his Disney+ subscription, as did Robin Quivers. After conferring with Kimmel, he said on his first live show since the suspension:</p><p>"When the government says, 'I'm not pleased with you, so we're going to orchestrate a way to silence you,' it's the wrong direction for our country. It isn't good."</p><p>Stern called the suspension "horrible" and "outrageous" for such a "big talent… You can't support this kind of a move. I don't care whether you like Jimmy or not. It's about freedom of speech. If ABC wanted to fire Jimmy because they didn't like him, or he had low ratings — they didn't want to fire him. They're being pressured by the United States government. We can't have that, not if we're going to have a democracy."</p><p>Howard has an awful lot of followers on Sirius XM that would take their cue from him. </p><p>Some 400 celebrities signed an ACLU letter calling this "a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation." These include Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman, Robert De Niro, Jane Fonda, Selena Gomez, Tom Hanks, Olivia Rodrigo, Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Keaton, Regina King, Diego Luna, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Natalie Portman, Maya Rudolph, Martin Short and Kerry Washington.</p><p>This is the kind of thing that Hollywood really cares about, the bold-faced names.</p><p>Kimmel is said to be concerned about the jobs of dozens of producers, staff members and contractors who would lose their livelihoods if the show was deep-sixed.</p><p>Disney made a point of saying in its statement that Kimmel was suspended because "we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive." But "thoughtful" conversations led to Jimmy’s return.</p><p>Whether you like Kimmel or not, no company can withstand that kind of pressure, even if it goes against the wishes of Donald Trump, who celebrated the suspension.</p><p>Now here’s the challenge Kimmel and Disney/ABC faced.</p><p>The suits had already been urging Kimmel to tone down the attacks against Trump. But Kimmel, who has hosted the program since 2003, and parlayed that into Oscars-hosting gigs, has always insisted on his independence. He’s arguably the most famous face at the network.</p><p>I played a small role in this last year by asking Trump about Kimmel after the Oscars, and the candidate slammed him, escalating their feud. Jimmy even took a swipe at me (horrors).</p><p>So perhaps with a wink and a nod, Kimmel has now agreed to tone things down a tad and the brass has agreed to let him basically say what’s on his mind.</p><p>Jimmy Kimmel is the only clear winner in this.</p><p>Everyone else – Disney, Bob Iger, Brendan Carr, ABC – is unmistakably a loser and will forever be branded, fairly or otherwise, as cowardly opponents of free speech.</p><p>And hey, ratings for tonight’s show should be through the roof. </p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Monday for her first interview since her loss to Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. </p><p>Harris, 60, didn’t hold back, calling her Republican opponent a "tyrant" and lambasting American CEOs for, what she deemed, capitulation to Trump. </p><p>"I worked closely with the private sector over many years, and I always believed that if push came to shove, those titans of industry would be guardrails for our democracy, for the importance of sustaining democratic institutions," Harris said. "And one by one by one, they have been silent. They have been, you know, yes, I use the word feckless." </p><p>Harris ridiculed the idea that the billionaire class would lose their yacht or their house in the Hamptons if they spoke out against Trump. She argued that capitalism thrives better under democracy than under authoritarian regimes. </p><p>"Democracy sustains capitalism. Capitalism thrives in a democracy. And right now, we are dealing with – as I called him at my speech on the ellipse – a tyrant. We used to compare the strength of our democracy to communist dictators. That's what we're dealing with right now under Donald Trump. And these titans of industry are not speaking up," she said. </p><p>Harris said she understood their hesitancy to speak out against the president, noting that his administration has gone after his critics. </p><p>"But at some point, they’ve got to stand up for the sake of the people who rely on all of these institutions to have integrity and to at some point be the guardrails against a tyrant who is using the federal government to execute his whim and fancy because of a fragile ego," Harris said. </p><p>Monday night’s interview on MSNBC came a day before the release of her new book, "107 Days," which will recount her tumultuous experience replacing former President Joe Biden as the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee after he dropped out of the race. </p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Detroit Lions went into Baltimore on Monday night and came away with a high-scoring victory, 38-30, over the Ravens. </p><p>The Lions moved to 2-1, while the Ravens are now 1-2 after faltering late in this game. </p><p>Being that these are two of the most explosive offenses in the NFL to start the new year, it was expected to be a shootout at M&amp;T Bank Stadium, and that’s exactly what football fans got from the Ravens and Lions. </p><p>It was Detroit getting on the board first with its opening drive, going 11 plays and 67 yards with Jahmyr Gibbs finding the end zone for the first time on the night with a one-yard run. But the Ravens’ opening-drive script was even better thanks to their Pro Bowl running back. </p><p>Derrick Henry, who had just 23 yards rushing in the win over the Cleveland Browns last week, broke that mark with a 28-yard touchdown run to even the score after the extra point. </p><p>After punts by both teams on their next drives, the Lions found themselves on their own two-yard line late in the first quarter. Baltimore was hoping to make it a quick punt given the circumstances, but Detroit was simply better at the line of scrimmage as they stayed true to the run game and managed to go 98 yards in 18 plays for a touchdown. </p><p>It was David Montgomery, Gibbs’ counterpart in the backfield, punching it in to cap a drive that took just under 11 minutes of first-half clock off the board to make it 14-7. </p><p>It appeared momentum would totally be on the Lions’ sideline, especially after being able to stop the Ravens near the goal line on four tries to get a turnover on downs. However, Lamar Jackson and company were able to tie things at 14 apiece with 24 seconds left in the second quarter after Rashod Bateman was found wide open in the front of the end zone. </p><p>As the second half began, Baltimore got right to work, going 11 plays and 73 yards where Jackson threw a seed to tight end Mark Andrews for the touchdown lead. But just like in the first half, Detroit had the answer with a touchdown of their own, as Goff placed the ball perfectly to Amon-Ra St. Brown, who was streaking down the right sideline into the end zone. </p><p>At 21 apiece entering the fourth quarter, and both offenses clearly clicking, this game felt like it was going to come down to the wire. The Lions got their lead back after a gadget play on fourth-and-1 from the Baltimore four-yard line, as St. Brown flipped it back to Gibbs for the score. </p><p>The Ravens were able to get a field goal and a timely punt, as they had 8:31 left in the fourth quarter and a four-point deficit to overcome. But Henry fumbled on the first play, as Aidan Hutchinson punched the ball out from behind. </p><p>Luckily, a facemask penalty by a Lions offensive lineman stalled a potential game-sealing drive, with Detroit forced to have Jake Bates nail a field goal to get their seven-point lead back. </p><p>Jackson and the Ravens needed another answering score, but the Lions’ defense was relentless and forced a three-and-out as the defensive front just kept getting Jackson down to the turf – something we’re certainly not used to seeing. </p><p>The Lions were able to sack Jackson seven times, with Al-Quadin Muhammad getting 2.5, while Hutchinson, Derrick Barnes, Trevor Nowaske and Jack Campbell each tallied one. </p><p>Detroit had the opportunity to seal their victory after forcing the punt, and they didn’t just get necessary first downs. Montgomery, who led the game with 151 yards rushing on 12 carries went 31 yards to the house to make it a 38-24 game. </p><p>The Lions also went for it on fourth down the play prior to the score, with Goff placing another great pass for St. Brown to not only keep the drive going, but not give Jackson the ball at midfield. Goff finished the game 20-of-28 for 202 yards with St. Brown leading the Lions with 77 yards on seven catches. </p><p>Detroit also had 225 rushing yards, with Gibbs going for 67 on 22 carries while also catching five passes for 32 yards. </p><p>For the Ravens, they had a touchdown drive with just seconds left on the clock, but it was too little too late in the end. </p><p>Jackson finished 21-of-27 for 288 yards with three touchdown passes, two of which going to Andrews who led the game with 91 receiving yards on six catches. Henry was held to just 50 yards on 12 carries as well. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris offered a lukewarm endorsement for New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in a Monday interview.</p><p>Harris sat down with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow for an interview where they discussed her new book "107 Days," which will release on Tuesday. Maddow highlighted a portion of Harris’ book that discussed the former VP’s "stars project," where she met with and identified rising stars in the Democratic Party.</p><p>Maddow asked Harris for her opinion on the socialist candidate as a rising star and whether she supported him.</p><p>"Look, as far as I’m concerned, he’s the Democratic nominee, and he should be supported," Harris began.</p><p>"Do you endorse his candidacy?" Maddow pressed.</p><p>"I support the Democrat in the race, sure," Harris said. </p><p>Harris quickly followed by saying that Mamdani was not the only "star" in the Democratic Party and hoped people would pay attention to other races throughout the country.</p><p>"But I mean, there are people like Barbara Drummond in Mobile, Alabama, Helena Moreno in New Orleans. They’re all running for mayor, too, and they are stars. So, I hope that we don’t so over index on New York City that we lose sight of the stars throughout our country who are right now running for mayor and many other offices, governor and so on. So that’s where I am. We got a big tent, and we got a lot of stars," Harris said.</p><p>Despite being the Democratic candidate for New York City mayor, Mamdani has yet to receive endorsements from major party leaders such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, both of whom also represent New York.</p><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul endorsed Mamdani on Sept. 14 after three months.</p><p>"New York City deserves a mayor who will stand up to Donald Trump and make life more affordable for New Yorkers. That’s @ZohranKMamdani," Hochul wrote on social media.</p><p>Mamdani has faced criticism from more moderate Democrats for his progressive proposals, such as city-owned grocery stores and his refusal to condemn the anti-Israel slogan "globalize the intifada."</p></body></div></body></html>

When it is like that in Baltimore, I will proudly ‘walk the streets’ with the failing, because of Crime, Governor of Maryland. P.S. Baltimore is ranked the 4th WORST CITY IN THE NATION IN CRIME &amp; MURDER," the president wrote.</p><p>The release of the footage also came as local police charged 18-year-old Naef Salmo of Millersville in connection with a crash that seriously injured a woman during one of these types of car takeovers.</p><p>Authorities said the incident happened around 1:45 a.m. on Sept. 14 at a shopping center on the 8500 block of Landover Road.</p><p>Investigators allege Salmo was spinning his car in circles when he struck a spectator. Instead of stopping, police say, he fled the scene, leaving the victim behind.</p><p>She was hospitalized with serious injuries but has since been released. Detectives later identified Salmo and located the vehicle.</p><p>According to police, he attempted to cover his tracks by spray-painting the car a different color.

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Colorado jury has ordered a local theme park and others to pay $205 million to the family of a 6-year-old girl who fell more than 100 feet to her death from a ride.</p><p>The verdict, issued Friday at Garfield County District Court, is among the largest wrongful death awards for a single plaintiff in state history.</p><p>Wongel Estifanos, from Colorado Springs, was visiting Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park with her family over Labor Day weekend in 2021 when tragedy struck on the Haunted Mine Drop.</p><p>Investigation paperwork reviewed by Fox News Digital shows Estifanos was not buckled into her seat properly before the ride started.</p><p>Instead, she was seated on top of still-buckled restraints that had been left by a previous rider. Even though a warning alarm sounded, an operator overrode the system and started the ride, according to the documents.</p><p>The Haunted Mine Drop, which was the first drop ride of its kind to plunge riders underground, dropped passengers 110 feet into a darkened shaft. Riders used to sit together on a bench-like seat in a dim chamber. </p><p>After being secured with seat belts, the lights would go out and the attraction would simulate a ghostly presence sending them plummeting downward in total darkness. </p><p>The freefall ended with glowing lanterns illuminating the mine walls before riders were brought back to the loading platform.</p><p>Following the 2021 incident, the Haunted Mine Drop was permanently closed. </p><p>"For four long years, Glenwood Caverns has denied fault for the death of Wongel, who was dropped ten stories to her death from a ride. Wongel’s parents took this case to trial to prove what really happened and to try to save others," Caplis added.</p><p>According to court documents, the family’s 2022 lawsuit alleged not only operator negligence, but also that Glenwood Caverns ignored repeated customer complaints about unsafe practices on the ride.</p><p>Investigators also concluded that multiple staff errors led to Estifanos’ death, including failing to prepare the seat belts before boarding began.</p><p>Glenwood Caverns marketing director Kimberly Marcum said in a statement that co-defendant Soaring Eagle Inc. had "manufactured the Haunted Mine Drop with a defective restraint system that caused this heartbreaking accident."</p><p>Marcum also indicated the manufacturer had certified the attraction as safe despite a defective restraint system. </p><p>"Our hearts go out to the family of Wongel Estifanos," Marcum said, while stating Glenwood Caverns was "exploring all options so that we can attempt to continue to operate, serve our guests, and continue to give back to the community."</p><p>Prosecutors declined to pursue criminal charges against Glenwood Caverns, citing challenges in proving manslaughter, but the civil trial gave Estifanos' family its day in court.</p><p>"They are grateful to the people of Garfield County for being so kind to them during this long trial," added Caplis in his statement.</p><p>Fox News Digital also contacted Soaring Eagle Inc for comment, but did not hear back.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Department of Homeland Security is criticizing Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker for failing to assist in responding to a chaotic anti-ICE riot in a Chicago suburb that forced federal authorities to deploy tear gas and other non-lethal measures.</p><p>In a Monday statement, the department claimed that police "under JB Pritzker’s sanctuary jurisdiction refused to answer multiple calls for assistance."</p><p>Fox News Digital reported last Friday that federal officials clashed with a group of protesters who were blocking ICE vehicles from entering and exiting a processing facility in Broadview, Illinois.</p><p>DHS labeled the protesters "rioters" and said that so far, federal law enforcement has arrested 16 rioters. The agency said that the "rioters and sanctuary politicians obstructed law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, rocks, bottles, and fireworks, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property." DHS said that rioters also assaulted law enforcement officials.</p><p>Matt Hill, a spokesperson for Pritzker, responded by telling Fox News Digital that "it's completely false to suggest the state or local municipalities have been obstructing federal officials." </p><p>"The state has not received multiple calls for assistance from the federal government and would remind them of the importance of coordinating with local law enforcement to protect public safety," said Hill. He added, "Governor Pritzker has been clear that violence is unacceptable and everyone needs to follow the law, which includes federal agents respecting constitutional rights to peaceful protest."</p><p>"The media needs to use extreme caution before reporting what the Trump administration is saying given their record of lies, lack of transparency, and failure to coordinate with the state and local law enforcement," said Hill. </p><p>The DHS statement said the protest disrupted an operation targeting "some of the worst of the worst—including criminals convicted of drug trafficking, domestic abuse, drinking and driving, and assault," who were being processed at the facility.</p><p>The agency highlighted some of the criminal illegals who were being processed when the protest broke out.</p><p>Among those was Andres Ventura-Uvaldo, a criminal illegal and Mexican national, who the agency said was previously arrested for felony DUI and domestic violence.</p><p>Another, Alberto Algeria Barron, also a Mexican national, was previously removed from the U.S. in 2014 and was convicted for domestic battery twice, according to DHS.</p><p>Erwin Jose Roa-Mustafa, an illegal alien from the Dominican Republic, was also being processed at the facility after pleading guilty on federal charges of conspiracy and intent to distribute a controlled substance and possession with intent to distribute fentanyl.</p><p>DHS said that ICE was also processing another alleged drug trafficker, Ibis Alberto Testa Nunez, from Mexico, who was previously arrested by the Drug Enforcement Administration for cocaine possession and possession with intent to distribute.</p><p>Two others, Salvador Alcantar-Alcantar, from Mexico, was previously arrested for DUI, trespassing and assault, and Carlos Eduardo Chavez-Cardenas, from Bolivia, was previously convicted for DUI and possession of drugs, according to DHS. </p><p>"These heinous criminals, including domestic abusers, drug traffickers, violent offenders, and drunk drivers are some of the illegal aliens being held in the ICE Broadview Processing Center," said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.</p><p>"These rioters in Illinois are fighting to keep rapists, murderers, and other violent criminals loose on Illinois streets," said McLaughlin. "Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers who every single day wake up and make our communities safer."</p><p>This comes as DHS says that ICE officials are facing a more than 1,000 percent increase in assaults as they conduct operations across Illinois. </p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Supporters of Charlie Kirk who are mourning his assassination are reflecting on his legacy and how it can be preserved.</p><p>"He was a rare talent in that he went into the literal lion's den on a regular basis," Christopher Jackson told Fox News Digital Sunday outside the Turning Point USA headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona. </p><p>"He made it his life purpose to go into the lion's den and civilly, in a time when a lot of it is not civil, to civilly have conversation with the other side, especially the impressionable young that are taught the complete opposite of what he felt and somehow in a relatively small amount of time turned it into where it was a crowd that was there to bash on him to where the crowd was mostly there to see him," Jackson added. </p><p>As mourners walked up to the Turning Point USA headquarters to pay their respects, they were greeted by a woman who owns a pop-up florist business and brought donated roses, baby’s breath, and other flowers so that each person could make their own bouquet in memory of Kirk. </p><p>"My brother donated 300, and then I allowed other people to give because in giving we receive," Terrie Overstreet, who runs The Flower Bus by Terrie, told Fox News Digital. </p><p>She said that her family donated flowers so that she could fill her blue and white 1964 Vintage Volkswagen bus with donated flowers for people to make bouquets. </p><p>"So I opened that up to the rest of my family and to my boyfriend's family and that they completed my goal, which was to fill the bus and so the bus is filled with family," Overstreet added. "And yeah, and I'd love to be able to say these are blossoms of blessings for Charlie."</p><p>Mourners from across the country visited Kirk’s headquarters to pay their respects, and leave flowers, notes, candles, and other mementos of appreciation to honor the 31-year-old co-founder and CEO of Turning Point USA, who was shot and killed Sept. 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University during his American Comeback Tour.</p><p>Even though Kirk was one of the youngest conservative leaders in the country, he had quickly become a defining influence in the movement and was a crucial figure in President Donald Trump's 2024 election victory. He founded Turning Point USA in 2012 as an 18-year-old with encouragement from Tea Party activist Bill Montgomery.</p><p>The key to having Kirk’s legacy live on is to live how he lived, Jackson said. </p><p>I’m just hoping I feel like more and more people are learning to not be silent," Jackson said. "And I think that's the answer to not be pushovers and to speak our mind and stand for what we believe like he did. And if anything I feel like that's the lasting legacy he left was to stand up for what you believe and not sheepishly let a lot of the ideology that the left espouses become the norm." </p><p>Ryan Elwood, who also spent time outside Turning Point USA’s headquarters to pay tribute, said that Kirk was a fair and honest communicator. </p><p>"He really brought to light truth, justice, and facts, and that was one of the big things that the world needs to hear is the facts and the truth behind the issues, and once you have the facts, the truth, you should be able to make your own opinion from there," Elwood said. "And I think he was very good about keeping it as unbiased as possible and making people come to their own conclusions." </p><p>Joel Freda told Fox News Digital that those who believed in Kirk’s mission must make it theirs in order for his legacy to endure. </p><p>"I think it's gonna take everybody that ever was involved with TPUSA, it's gonna take people that ever watched him," Freda said. "And he's not somebody that is replaceable... It's going to take a lot of people. And it's a massive effort. But I think he, through the work that he did for – what was it, 13 years when he started – he was like 18, 17. He built that foundation so that now it's there, the structure's already there for people to do that."</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Sinclair Broadcast Group announced Monday that it would preempt ABC’s "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" when it returns Tuesday night.</p><p>"Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming. Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show’s potential return," the company’s statement read.</p><p>Sinclair, which operates 30 ABC affiliates, previously joined Nexstar, another owner of ABC affiliates, in preempting Kimmel’s show last week after he made controversial comments regarding Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin.</p><p>"Mr. Kimmel’s remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country," Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith said in a statement.</p><p>At the time, Sinclair said that it would not lift its suspension until after discussions with ABC.</p><p>"Sinclair also calls upon Mr. Kimmel to issue a direct apology to the Kirk family. Furthermore, we ask Mr. Kimmel to make a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk family and Turning Point USA," the company stated. "Regardless of ABC’s plans for the future of the program, Sinclair intends not to return ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ to our air until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform."</p><p>Kimmel's late-night show was pulled off the air entirely last Wednesday after Kimmel's remarks about the alleged assassin of Charlie Kirk sparked outrage and a veiled threat from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). </p><p>Disney decided to suspend the show after Sinclair and Nexstar pulled its airings of Kimmel, and Kimmel reportedly had told executives he would not apologize for his comments.</p><p>Disney reversed course on Monday and announced that Kimmel’s show would return in a statement Monday.</p><p>"Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country.  It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.  We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday," a Disney spokesperson told Fox News Digital.</p></body></div></body></html>

                <div class="article-source">Latest & Breaking News on Fox News</div>
                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Brittany Aldean felt a range of emotions while attending Charlie Kirk's memorial service in Arizona on Sunday.</p><p>Brittany, 37, joined husband Jason Aldean and nearly 100,000 others at State Farm Stadium to mourn the loss of the Turning Point founder, who was shot and killed while speaking outside of Utah Valley University on Sept. 10.</p><p>The former "American Idol" star admitted the day "was overwhelming," but that she was inspired by how Kirk "impacted people" as she detailed the service for her social media followers on Instagram.</p><p>"Yesterday we went to Charlie's funeral service in Arizona, and it was vastly different than what I anticipated in the sense that it was just so faith-based," Brittany began. "I knew it was going to be but everyone was worshiping … everybody. There was just something different in the room."</p><p>President Donald Trump, Charlie's wife Erika Kirk, and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. were just a few of the speakers to eulogize Kirk Sunday.</p><p>"This man's legacy that he has left, the impact that he's had on so many people … Like, I knew he had impacted a ton of people, but this feels different," Brittany said. "His death does feel like – everyone said in the services – a revival. It's putting more people in touch with their faith, and just making such a difference in so many different lives, and it was very apparent yesterday."</p><p>She noted, "It was overwhelming. I expected to go in there and cry the whole time. I brought this big thing of tissues, and instead, it was weirdly positive and extremely sad, but it was awesome to hear stories about him personally and … how he's impacted people, and how he's going to be so missed, but that his legacy was so large."</p><p>"He had a different purpose in life, and it was just so good to hear people say that. There was just a different plan that was greater for him that God knew," she said. "It left me feeling more positive after the service, and he's obviously so missed. Something's different about this."</p><p>Brittany left her followers with the note, "They keep saying live like Charlie, so I'm going to really try to do that daily."</p><p>The Aldeans were just a few of the prominent figures who paid their respects to Kirk at his memorial service in Glendale.</p><p>During an appearance on "Fox &amp; Friends," Savannah Chrisley — who was set to join Kirk on a college campus tour before his assassination — opened up about the impact the conservative activist had on her life and explained why it is important to continue his fight. </p><p>"I think when this assassin did take Charlie's life, that was the turning point for him," Chrisley said. "He thought he was ending Charlie's life, but he really just created millions and millions of Charlie's followers to fight. To fight for our freedom, to fight for us to have a voice. For me to watch it, it's so sad and it breaks my heart. To see Erika [Charlie's wife] step in as a woman and take on this role, Charlie knew that if he couldn't do it, she was the only one that could do it."</p><p>Chrisley said that Kirk "gave [her] a voice in times when she felt she didn't have one."</p><p>"I was so excited to get to sit next to Charlie and open up to him and get to know him on a more personal level, like a lot of my friends who got to know him," she said. "But above all else, Charlie has been a voice for our country." </p><p>The reality TV star said it is remarkable to see how Charlie's legacy at Turning Point USA has impacted young adults, including her brother. </p><p>"To watch my 19-year-old brother and watch all these college kids now show up and be loud and not be afraid because, at the end of the day, our lives are on the line," she said. "2028 is coming up. And Charlie, he wants us to fight. He wants us to be loud. And he said it himself, 'If you don't correct evil, if you don't speak about evil, when evil is happening, then that in itself is evil.' So it's my job to stand up, be loud, and really I don't care who likes it and who doesn't."</p><p>"I keep saying that above all else, Charlie Kirk and his wife Erika, are Christians," she continued. "Isn't that really the message? I think bringing Christianity back into households is the only thing that's going to save us as a country. I know for me, my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, I don't know where I would be today without it. And so watching Erika, I don't know how she spoke the word of God after losing her husband. I mean, I was in such awe to know that she is now the leader of Turning Point. I mean, we only go up from here."</p><p>Authorities identified Kirk's murder suspect as Tyler Robinson, 22. Robinson was arrested and charged with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily harm, and two counts of obstruction of justice, according to a court affidavit. A judge ordered that he be held without bail.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Christina Dugan Ramirez contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

                <html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Deion Sanders is focused on his quarterback situation with the Colorado Buffaloes, but he made a bold prediction about his son Shedeur Sanders’ NFL future with the Cleveland Browns.</p><p>"Coach Prime" said he believes his son will start for the Browns at some point this season.</p><p>Sanders shared his thoughts Monday on the "New Heights" podcast, telling hosts Jason and Travis Kelce he has "got a feeling when it’s going to go down."</p><p>When asked what advice he’s given Shedeur, who is waiting his turn behind Joe Flacco and Dillon Gabriel, Deion said: "Be patient and be ready." He declined to reveal when he expects Shedeur to make his first start, and the Kelces did not press him.</p><p>Head coach Kevin Stefanski has given no indication of a quarterback change. Flacco has led the Browns to a 1-2 record through three games, with the offense inconsistent but the defense among the league’s best.</p><p>Shedeur isn’t even the primary backup at this point. Gabriel, selected two rounds earlier in the 2025 NFL Draft, earned that role after preseason evaluations, Stefanski said.</p><p>Deion also revisited draft-night drama, confirming that Shedeur slid to the fifth round before being picked by Cleveland. He said the Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles both showed interest.</p><p>Cam Newton, the former No. 1 overall pick, recently noted the Eagles’ pursuit of Shedeur. As for the Ravens, Deion essentially confirmed reports that his son told executive vice president Ozzie Newsome he wasn’t interested in sitting behind Lamar Jackson long-term.</p><p>"How in the world can somebody fault [Shedeur] for saying or thinking, ‘Why in the world would I go back up Lamar for 10 more years?’" Deion said on the podcast. "I’ve never sat on the bench and said, ‘Well, I learned a lot today.’"</p><p>The Browns drafted Shedeur with the expectation of developing him for the future, with Flacco seen as a stopgap until one of their rookies is ready. So far, the coaching staff believes Gabriel is ahead, but the season is still young.</p><p>For now, Shedeur remains third on the depth chart, though Deion remains confident his son will eventually get his chance. Whether that comes this season remains to be seen.</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>
