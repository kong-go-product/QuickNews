      "description": "The Cleveland Guardians made baseball history with their September comeback against Detroit Tigers, setting up a dramatic playoff matchup at Progressive Field.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>Baseball history was just made by the Cleveland Guardians. The Detroit Tigers (87-75) led the Guardians (88-74) by 9.5 games on Sept. 10 with 16 games left to play (Cleveland had 17), but finished 3-13, while Cleveland went 14-3.</p><p>At one point in July, the Guards were 15.5 games behind the Tigers, making Cleveland’s comeback the greatest ever since divisional play came to MLB in 1969. The prior record was the 15 game comeback by the Yankees to take the American League Eastern Division in 1978 after trailing the Boston Red Sox by 14 games. It’s been a remarkable September for the Guardians, truly one of a kind. (And for the Tigers, though of exactly the opposite kind.)</p><p>Because the baseball gods have a sense of humor, Cleveland will host Detroit in a best of three games series beginning today at a little after 1 PM ET. The second game (and a third, if necessary, will start at the same time and at the same place.)</p><p>So yes, we Guardians fans are pretty excited. I have plenty of friends who tweak me by calling the Guardians by their old name, \"the Indians\" and by their old nickname, the Tribe — and my muscle memory takes over sometimes and I use the old name and nickname too. </p><p>But I cheer for clubs, not nicknames. So do the vast majority of Cleveland fans. Tweak away in the comments. I don’t care. The Guardians are still hosting the Tigers, starting today a little past 1 PM ET today from Progressive Field at the corner of Carnegie and Ontario in Cleveland. Tom Hamilton (\"Hammy\") will be calling the games and he’s the best in the business. Terry Pluto will be writing about the games along with Paul Hoynes and Joe Noga and maybe Jimmy Watkins over at Cleveland.com. Northeast Ohio takes its professional clubs very seriously, so the local news outlets devote resources to serving the fan base and the vast diaspora of Cleveland fans keep those platforms afloat and not because of political controversies in Cuyahoga County. </p><p>An aside: I met my wife in the fall of 1978 at a fundraiser for then San Diego mayor Pete Wilson. She has endured decades of Cleveland Browns, Cleveland Cavaliers and Cleveland Indians/Guardians seasons since. There has been a total of one championship in those years (the Cavs won a stunning upset over the Golden State Warriors in 2016), so sports widows and widowers of the last half century, buckle up. Your spouse is going to be a bit crazy again for at least this week. And brace yourself. You know the dark clouds descend and they last a few days. But perhaps not this fall!</p><p>Cleveland hasn’t won a World Series in my lifetime, last doing so in 1948. They have come close in 1995, 1997 and 2016, but close doesn’t get you a ring. (They also won it all in 1920 and lost it in 1954, but as I didn’t have to watch the collapse of 1954 I am as indifferent to that as to the 1920 and 1948 triumphs.) </p><p>The Browns have never been to a Super Bowl. They last won the NFL Championship in 1964. The Cavs are pretty good right now, but they have never won it all without LeBron James. So there are skeptics. But it could possibly be two championships in the cycle. (The Browns are not in the hunt absent a miraculous emergence of rookie QBs Dillon Gabriel or Shedeur Sanders.)  </p><p>THE Ohio State University has provided some relief, claiming national championships in college football in 1968, 1970, 2002, 2014 and the most recent one after the 2024 regular season, running the gauntlet of four playoff games for the first time in the sport’s history. They could even repeat. </p><p>But professional sports in Cleveland? It’s been a desert with one oasis for 50 years.</p><p>Which is a long way of explaining to you that there may be mood swings among your colleagues this week (and maybe longer) if the Guards’ run goes on. You may not know they are from Ohio, though we usually tell you. And we are certainly going to tell you this week and beyond for as long as \"Guards Ball\" goes on. </p><p>Cleveland has the best fan base in the country and the longest suffering. So put up with us this October. We couldn’t quite believe September. But it’s very much Believeland this month.  </p><p><i>Hugh Hewitt is host of \"The Hugh Hewitt Show,\" heard weekday mornings 6am to 9am ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the number three Republican in Senate leadership, is turning up the volume on his effort to protect and strengthen the GOP's majority in the chamber in next year's elections.</p><p>A non-profit public advocacy group aligned with the senator on Tuesday launched an ad highlighting GOP Rep. Ashley Hinson of Iowa, who's running in the 2026 race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Joni Ernst.</p><p>The ad is the latest effort by Cotton, the Army veteran who served in combat in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars before becoming a rising GOP star, to support Republicans in key Senate races in next year's midterm elections when the party will be defending its 53-47 majority in the chamber.</p><p>\"Iowa has a fighter in Washington. Her name is Ashley Hinson,\" says the narrator in the spot by America One Policies, which was first shared with Fox News Digital.</p><p>Hinson, a former local TV anchor, has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and by the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) as she runs to keep Iowa's open Senate seat in the party's hands.</p><p>The narrator highlights that Hinson \"is tough on crime, and she's tough on China. Ashley fought to stop China from buying our farmland, and she voted for President Trump's tax cuts.\"</p><p>\"Ashley Hinson is putting more money in your pocket. Tell her to keep fighting for Iowa,\" the narrator adds.</p><p>The Cotton-aligned group tells Fox News that it will spend six-figures to run the ad on broadcast TV and digital in the Des Moines market.</p><p>It's the second spot this cycle by America One Policies following an ad that targets Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, whom Republicans consider the most vulnerable Democratic senator running for re-election in 2026.</p><p>And earlier this month, Cotton's leadership PAC went up with an ad that takes aim at North Carolina's former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who's running against former Republican National Committee chair Michael Whately in the race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Thom Tillis.</p><p>An America One Polices spokesperson told Fox News that \"Senator Cotton plans to fight for his colleagues in the US Senate, to ensure that we grow our majority in the senate, to fundraise and advertise for our candidates and to make sure that the American people know the records of their Democrat opponents. American One Policies will be assisting our candidates across the United States throughout this election cycle.\"  </p><p>Cotton, who didn't face a Democratic Party opponent as he cruised to re-election in 2020 and who isn't expected to face a difficult re-election next year in red state Arkansas, has crisscrossed the country in recent election cycles to campaign on behalf of fellow Republicans.</p><p>\"As Tom Cotton has done since the first day he was elected to office, he will continue to help support Republicans around the country who are running for office at any level, to win,\" a source in the senator's political orbit told Fox News Digital.</p><p>The 48-year-old Cotton took a hard look at running for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination as he made numerous trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states that have long kicked off the GOP's presidential primary calendar.</p><p>But days before the 2022 midterms, Cotton announced he wouldn't run for the White House in 2024. </p><p>And last year, Cotton was considered to be on now-President Donald Trump's larger list of potential running mates.</p><p>Cotton's support for Hinson in Iowa may spark speculation about a potential future run by the senator for the White House.</p></body></div></body></html>"

      "description": "Ric Grenell commented the on business decisions behind the return of &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; to the air after ABC sidelined the program earlier this month.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p> - Kennedy Center President Ric Grenell blamed Jimmy Kimmel's one-sided rhetoric for his temporary late-night TV suspension on Saturday at the Kennedy Center Gala benefiting the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO).</p><p>Both Sinclair and Nexstar announced last week they would resume airing \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after sidelining the program due to the comedian's comments about Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin, which attempted to link him to the MAGA movement.</p><p>Grenell said Disney made a necessary business decision by benching the late-night host.</p><p>\"Look, I think from the beginning Disney made decisions because Jimmy was losing tens of millions of dollars every year,\" Grenell said in a red carpet interview with Fox News Digital, although the show's exact financial worth when taking into account its online presence is unknown. \"And I don’t think we should have DEI programming just because people are afraid of political blowback.\"</p><p>\"You should be able to make decisions… We just saw this week The New York Times highlight how Broadway is dying,\" he continued. \"People are not buying tickets. We’ve got to do something in the offset to change that trajectory. And I think studios, and broadcast studios, anyone who’s involved in entertainment, has to be able to bring programming that people want.\"</p><p>In the report Grenell referenced, \"The Broadway musical is in trouble,\" the paper noted that all 18 commercial musicals that opened on Broadway last season have yet to turn a profit. </p><p>\"The new musicals ‘Tammy Faye,’ ‘Boop!’ and ‘Smash’ each cost at least $20 million to bring to the stage, and each was gone less than four months after opening,\" according to the Times. \"All three lost their entire investments.\"</p><p>The Times suggested rising production costs are partly to blame for Broadway’s challenges, while Grenell pointed to Kimmel’s \"one-sided\" humor as the reason his late-night show has struggled.</p><p>\"Let’s be honest,\" Grenell said. \"Everybody knows that Jimmy Kimmel is losing money because he has guests that are just one side of the aisle. All his jokes are on one side of the aisle. And you’re just not going to make money when you take 50 percent of the customers off the table.\"</p><p>Grenell added that the Kennedy Center had similar struggles before his tenure. While the current leadership has not canceled any performances under his watch, several artists have chosen to bow out since the so-called \"Trump takeover.\"</p><p>\"And so we want to have a very strong message that says everyone is welcome here,\" Grenell said. \"We have not canceled a single show. There have been some who have walked away because they don’t want to perform for Republicans. I say shame on that intolerance. Everyone should be welcome here, and we should not care who you voted for.\"</p><p>Kennedy Center board member Mary Helen Bowers, who joined the board in 2020 under President Donald Trump, said she wasn't a fan of Kimmel's controversial comments but also cited finances as the impetus for his suspension.</p><p>\"Well, I thought his comments were disgusting and vile and Charlie Kirk is a great hero,\" Bowers told Fox News Digital. \"But I think that, from my understanding of it, if his numbers were bad, and he wasn’t performing, then he shouldn’t be on the air.\"</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Disney for comment.</p><p>\"The focus is on pleasing the audience,\" Bowers said of the current Kennedy Center leadership. \"And that’s what the arts is really about. It’s about creating beauty and creating a great experience, but with Grenell’s leadership, he’s very focused on the bottom line and the financial health of the center, which is tremendously important, especially in this time.\"</p><p>The NSO is celebrating its 95th anniversary season. Featured works at Saturday's concert included Aaron Copland's \"Fanfare for the Common Man,\" Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Capriccio Espagnol\" and Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's \"Piano Concerto No.1.\" The Kennedy Center Gala raised a total of $3.45 million, nearly triple what the NSO has raised in previous years. About half of those in attendance were first-time Gala guests.</p></body></div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>With five weeks to go until Election Day, polls indicate a very close contest in the battle for New Jersey governor.</p><p>New Jersey is just one of two states, along with Virginia, that hold statewide elections for governor this November. And the contests, which traditionally grab outsized national attention, are viewed as crucial early tests of President Donald Trump's popularity and agenda, and key barometers ahead of next year's midterm showdowns for the U.S. House and Senate.</p><p>Also in the political spotlight this November is the ballot box proposition over congressional redistricting in California, the three state Supreme Court contests in battleground Pennsylvania, and New York City's high-profile mayoral election.</p><p>Democrats, who are aiming to exit the political wilderness following last year's election setbacks when they lost control of the White House and Senate and failed to win back the House majority, are highlighting their success so far this year in special elections.</p><p>\"There's wind at our back,\" Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Ken Martin recently touted. \"We have overperformed in every single election that's been on the ballot since Donald Trump was inaugurated.\"</p><p>But Republicans point to the multitude of problems facing the Democratic Party.</p><p>\"Sadly for the DNC, the truth is that Democrats' approval rating is at a 30-year low as the party has hemorrhaged more than 2 million voters over the past four years,\" Republican National Committee communications director Zach Parkinson told Fox News Digital recently.</p><p>Here's a closer look at 2025's top elections.</p><p>He's not on the ballot, but Trump and his unprecedented second-term agenda weigh heavily on this year's ballot box battle for governor of New Jersey.</p><p>And Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli, who enjoys the president's support, says Democratic nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill is trying to use Trump as a cudgel.</p><p>\"Listen, if you get a flat tire on the way home from work today, she's going to blame it on the president. There isn't anything she doesn't blame on the president,\" Ciattarelli argued, as he sat this week for an interview with Fox News Digital.</p><p>Sherrill, in a recent fundraising email to supporters, charged, \"As Trump has inflicted all this damage on our country, Republican politicians like Jack Ciattarelli have cheered him on every step of the way.\"</p><p>And at their first debate a week and a half ago, she pointed to Ciattarelli and claimed that \"he’ll do whatever Trump tells him to do.\"</p><p>The combustible ballot box battle in New Jersey was rocked last week after a report revealed that the United States Naval Academy blocked her from taking part in her 1994 graduation amid a cheating scandal.</p><p>Ciattarelli and his campaign are calling on Sherrill, who went on to pilot helicopters during her military career after graduating from the Naval Academy, to release her military records to explain why she was blocked from attending her graduation ceremony.</p><p>\"What we learned today is that she was part of it in some way, shape or form. Come clean, release the records. Tell us what's in your disciplinary records. I think the people of New Jersey deserve that,\" Ciattarelli said Thursday night in an interview on Fox News' \"Hannity.\"</p><p>But a second report revealed that the National Personnel Records Center, which is a branch of the National Archives and Records Administration, errantly released Sherrill's improperly redacted military personnel files, which included private information including her social security number, to a Ciattarelli ally. </p><p>The news spurred calls by top Democrats across the country for an investigation.</p><p>\"To have a guy I'm running against, it will stop at nothing, it will stop at nothing, who will illegally obtain records. It's just beyond the pale,\" Sherrill, who served as a federal prosecutor before winning election to Congress, charged Thursday night on the campaign trail in Plainfield, New Jersey.</p><p>The two candidates face off next week in the second and final debate in the race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.</p><p>Ciattarelli, who is making his third straight run for governor and who came close to upsetting Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy four years ago, discounted talk that Trump is the dominant issue in the race.</p><p>And Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker and a certified public accountant who started a medical publishing company before getting into politics, charged that the Democrats are to blame, as he works overtime trying to link Sherrill to Murphy and the Democrats who've long controlled the state legislature in Trenton.</p><p>Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is facing off against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger in the race to succeed GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</p><p>Youngkin is prevented from running for re-election, as Virginia's constitution does not allow sitting governors to seek consecutive terms.</p><p>Earle-Sears was born in the Caribbean island nation of Jamaica and immigrated to the U.S. at the age of 6. She served in the Marines and is a former state lawmaker who made history four years ago when she won election as Virginia's first female lieutenant governor. </p><p>Spanberger is a former intelligence officer in the CIA who won election to Congress in 2018 before securing re-election in 2020 and 2022.</p><p>The winner in November will make history as Virginia's first female governor in the commonwealth's four-century-long history. Additionally, if Earle-Sears comes out on top, she will become the nation's first Black woman to win election as governor.</p><p>Trump and his policies are a major issue in the state's gubernatorial showdown.</p><p>The president's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been on a mission this year to chop government spending and cut the federal workforce.</p><p>The moves by DOGE, which was initially steered by Elon Musk, the world's richest person, have been felt acutely in suburban Washington's heavily populated northern Virginia, with its large federal workforce.</p><p>The mayoral election in the nation's most populous city always grabs outsized attention, especially this year as New York City may elect its first Muslim and first millennial mayor.</p><p>Democratic socialist 33-year-old state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani's victory in June's Democratic Party mayoral primary sent political shock waves across the country. And he's come under attack from Republicans and from his rivals on the ballot over his far-left proposals.</p><p>Mamdani is the clear frontrunner in the heavily blue city as he faces off against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who came in a distant second in the primary and is now running as an independent candidate. Cuomo is aiming for a political comeback after resigning as governor four years ago amid multiple scandals.</p><p>Also running is two-time Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, a co-founder of the Guardian Angels, the non-profit, a volunteer-based community safety group.</p><p>Embattled Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who was running for re-election as an independent, dropped out of the race on Sunday, but his name remains on the ballot.</p><p>Trump, a native New Yorker, has continuously been in the spotlight in the race for months.</p><p>Voters in heavily blue California will vote in November on whether to temporarily set aside their popular nonpartisan redistricting commission and allow the Democrat-dominated legislature to determine congressional redistricting for the next three election cycles.</p><p>The vote will be the culmination of an effort by Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Democrats to create up to five left-leaning congressional seats in the Golden State to counter the new maps that conservative Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law last week, which will create up to five more right-leaning U.S. House districts in the red state of Texas.</p><p>The redistricting in Texas, which came after Trump's urging, is part of a broader effort by the GOP across the country to pad their razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.</p><p>Democrats currently hold a 5-2 majority on Pennsylvania's highest court. </p><p>But three Democrat-leaning justices on the state Supreme Court, following the completion of their 10-year terms, are running to keep their seats in \"Yes\" or \"No\" retention elections.</p><p>The election could upend the court's composition for the next decade, heavily influence whether Democrats or Republicans have an advantage in the state's congressional delegation and legislature, and impact crucial cases including voting rights and reproductive rights.</p><p>While state Supreme Court elections typically don't grab much national attention, contests where the balance of a court in a key battleground state is up for grabs have attracted tons of outside money.</p><p>The state Supreme Court showdown this spring in Wisconsin, where the 4-3 liberal majority was maintained, drew nearly $100 million in outside money as both parties poured resources into the election.</p></body></div></body></html>"

      "description": "The rare mass gathering of U.S. flag officers at Quantico is an opportunity to clarify civilian-military relations as leaders plan -course corrections.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>On Tuesday, Sept. 30, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth is bringing hundreds of U.S. generals and admirals to Quantico for what amounts to a mass leadership formation. The agenda is opaque, the logistics unusual and the stakes high. With President Donald Trump now planning to attend, the gathering risks becoming as much a signal about civil-military relations as it is about readiness. What should Americans take from it — and what should our flag officers hear? </p><p>First, let’s dispense with the novelty. Large, in-person convocations of nearly the entire general and flag officer corps are rare. Reporting indicates Hegseth intends to hammer \"warrior ethos,\" grooming and standards — an unmistakable course-correction message to a force that has struggled with recruitment, retention and public confidence. Whether or not every rumor about mass firings is overblown, the form and timing are extraordinary. </p><p>Second, size and scale matter. By Pentagon counts this summer, there are roughly 838 active-duty generals and admirals. Independent analysis notes that asking \"about 800\" to show up would approach the total population — hence the shock across commands. Even if the real attendance is lower due to staff exemptions, it’s still unprecedented. </p><p>Third, context matters. Trump’s decision to appear adds a political charge no speech can avoid. Some will see a morale boost, others, politicization. In a constitutional republic, civilian control of the military is not theater — it’s principle. When hundreds of flag officers assemble under cameras and floodlights, allies and adversaries alike read the optics. That’s why clarity of purpose and restraint of tone matter as much as content. </p><p>Fourth, history matters — especially the comparison so many are already making. At the end of World War II, about 12.2 million Americans were on active duty (roughly 16 million served at some point in the war), and there were a little over 2,000 general and flag officers — a ratio around 1:6,000. Today we have roughly 1.3 million active-duty personnel and about 800-840 flag officers — a ratio closer to 1:1,500. Reasonable people can debate the right number, but the trend line is undeniable: the General and Flag Officer (GO/FO) corps has grown as a share of the total force. </p><p>So, what should this meeting accomplish? </p><p>1. Put \"warrior ethos\" back where it belongs: in readiness, not rhetoric. Fitness standards, small-unit proficiency and combat-credible training are not partisan issues. They’re the bedrock of deterrence. If Hegseth focuses his charge on measurable outputs — deployable readiness, training reps that mimic the fight we face, and clear, published standards enforced without fear or favor — he’ll have broad support in the ranks and among taxpayers. Announcing a short list of concrete readiness metrics the services will publicly report would be a solid start. </p><p>2. Depoliticize the flag ranks — by example as much as exhortation. The surest way to keep the military out of politics is for political leaders to keep politics out of the military. That cuts both ways. The secretary can demand commanders enforce standards and shut down ideological litmus tests — from any direction. He can also reaffirm that promotions, billets and reliefs will be based on performance and warfighting requirements, not Twitter/X storms or cable-news narratives. The presence of the commander-in-chief raises the temperature; the remarks should lower it. </p><p>3. Right-size and de-layer the headquarters without hollowing the force. If reductions to general/flag billets are coming, they should be targeted at overhead and staff inflation, not the command chains we’ll need on Day One of a crisis. The department has lived through pendulum swings before. A principled framework — tie billets to mission, eliminate duplicative structures, shift resources to operational units — beats a blunt \"slash the stars\" headline. CRS has documented how the GO/FO share has crept up over decades even as end strength fell; use this moment to reverse bloat where it doesn’t touch combat power. </p><p>4. Speak to the strategic environment plainly. While Washington fixates on the spectacle, Beijing, Moscow and Tehran are counting cards. A mass stateside recall can be misread abroad. The message to the generals should be unambiguous: U.S. joint forces will maintain global command presence, allied obligations and crisis response timelines uninterrupted. Any reorganization must enhance, not slow, the ability to surge combat power to the Western Pacific, Europe or CENTCOM on short notice. </p><p>5) Restore trust with the country. The American people expect two things from their military: win wars and stay out of politics. The way to do both is to align words, standards, and structure with the mission. Invite public accountability — publish the metrics that matter, acknowledge where we’re short and show the plan to fix it. That transparency will calm speculation and strengthen civilian confidence. </p><p>Critics will ask why convene everyone in person when secure video exists. It’s a fair question. But if Hegseth uses the moment to set unifying, apolitical expectations; to define readiness in terms that matter to warfighters; and to start carefully trimming bureaucracy so resources flow to the edge, the meeting will be worth the disruption. If it becomes a pep rally or a purge rumor mill, it will do more harm than good. </p><p>America has always course-corrected its armed forces in eras of danger. What we cannot do is confuse showmanship for strategy. The right charge to the flag ranks is broad brush on purpose — because the mission is. Demand a tougher force, a cleaner chain of command, a leaner headquarters and a military that remembers who it serves and what it’s for. That’s a message worthy of bringing the generals home to hear.</p></body></div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced on Sept. 29 a government-led initiative to boost coal use and production in the U.S. As he told Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo in an interview: this will not sit well with the Chardonnay set. </p><p>As electricity prices soar across the U.S., thanks in part to dogged efforts by blue-state officials to dump fossil fuels, those climate-obsessed voices will be drowned out by those of struggling consumers. </p><p>Over the two decades from January 1985 through January 2005, electricity prices in the U.S. climbed by only 19%; in the following 20 years until January of this year, electricity prices exploded by more than 90%. Just this year, the price per kilowatt-hour has jumped another 6%.  </p><p>In California, the trends are even worse as Golden State residents pay almost double the average charge in the U.S. People living in New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts are similarly paying much higher prices than the national average. Why the disparity? Because Democrat-run states have purposefully shifted to high-cost and unreliable renewable energy. </p><p>In New York, as governor, Andrew Cuomo banned fracking and banned new pipelines from bringing much-needed and cheaper natural gas into his state. New Jersey and other blue states promoted similar measures, while embracing renewables like offshore wind and solar that are intermittent and therefore need backup, usually provided by natural gas. This is not efficient, and it is costly. </p><p>Unlike the Biden administration, the Trump White House understands that the demand for energy over the next few years, thanks in particular to AI and other new technologies, will expand at a pace that will truly demand an \"all of the above\" approach. That means not just increased oil and natural gas production, investments in solar and other renewables, but also more reliance on nuclear power and — yes — on coal.  </p><p>President Barack Obama, Biden and other climate warriors have, for years, waged war against coal, which today accounts for 15% of electricity production, down from half as recently as 2000. In 2016, then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton proudly claimed her clean energy policies would \"put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,\" a boneheaded remark that showed how out of touch the former first lady was with the needs of working-class Americans. At the time, there were some 70,000 coal miners in the U.S.; today, that has shrunk to 40,000. </p><p>President Donald Trump recognizes that one of the greatest assets of the United States, enhancing our ability to compete in next-generation technology, is our abundant cheap energy, and especially coal. The government’s Energy Information Administration wrote last year, \"In the United States, coal resources are larger than remaining natural gas and oil resources.\" In addition, it reported that, \"As of Jan. 1, 2024, the demonstrated reserve base (DRB) was estimated to contain 469 billion short tons of coal.\"  </p><p>The 2024 production was just above 500 million short tons, or less than half of the amount produced in 2008. Roughly speaking, we could double current coal output and produce at that level for hundreds of years. That is not an asset any government should ignore. </p><p>The Chinese certainly would not let such a reserve go to waste. While the U.S. and Europe sacrifice using cheap coal in favor of higher-cost renewables in their quest to cut carbon emissions, the Chinese are building coal-fired power plants as rapidly as they can, the environmental consequences be damned. </p><p>While China is opening coal plants, the U.S. has been shutting ours down. The White House will change that. The government is planning to spend $625 million, including $350 million to modernize coal plants, $175 million for coal projects that will target rural communities and some $100 million to make existing plants cleaner and more efficient. Overall, the objective is to keep more plants running, including dozens that were slated to close.  </p><p>This is not the first move made by the Trump White House to expand coal’s role in our energy system. In spring, the president signed an executive order instructing the head of the National Energy Dominance Council to designate coal as a \"mineral\"; the purpose was to \"streamline permitting,\" which would allow more leasing and ultimately more production overall, and, specifically, on federal lands. The president also demanded that agencies reduce \"barriers\" to coal mining and \"rescind any agency policies that seek to transition the nation away from coal production.\"  </p><p>Wright told Bartiromo that, \"We’re going to export more of that coal, we’re going to use it for American industry, particularly as we reindustrialize, and it’s going to continue to provide 15%-16% of our electricity and enable us to reindustrialize and win the AI race.\"  </p><p>The Trump administration is not just focused on coal. It is also pushing for higher oil and natural gas production, reversing Biden’s slow-walking of drilling permits and leasing. Oil production is up about 3% this year, but that is just the beginning. </p><p>In August, the Department of the Interior proposed a new oil and gas offshore leasing plan that includes 30 auctions in the Gulf of America through 2040 and six auctions in Alaska’s Cook Inlet through 2032. That’s a far cry from the Biden administration’s plan, which scheduled a total of only three oil and gas lease sales — the minimum required by the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden leased fewer federal acres for oil and gas than any president since World War II.   </p><p>Nuclear, too, is getting a boost from the Trump White House. In May, Trump initiated a \"nuclear energy renaissance,\" directing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline the approval process for new reactors, including setting a new 18-month deadline for licensing decisions. The goal? Increase U.S. nuclear energy capacity from around 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050.  </p><p>This \"all of the above\" energy renewal program — exploiting this country’s vast energy resources — may well become President Trump’s greatest legacy. We need energy to compete … and to make America great again.  </p></body></div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>Let’s roll back the clock.</p><p>After the 2020 election, Donald Trump found himself the target of multiple investigations.</p><p>The flimsiest, and most partisan, was brought by Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, who somehow elevated the Stormy Daniels payoffs from a misdemeanor to a felony, and got a conviction.</p><p>Then there was Jack Smith, who launched two investigations — one involving classified documents, the other on allegations related to Jan. 6.</p><p>And in Georgia, Fulton County DA Fani Willis investigated Trump’s famous phone call to Brad Raffensperger — \"I just want to find 11,780 votes\" — and some of Trump’s lawyers, such as Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis, pleaded guilty.</p><p>Beyond that, New York AG Letitia James filed a civil suit about inflated property values that led to a fine that has since grown to half a billion dollars — a penalty so outrageous that an appeals court threw it out on grounds of cruel and unusual punishment.</p><p>And what was the mindset of the media, the Democrats and at least half the country at that time?</p><p>It was that Trump had done a lot of bad things, and if he could be successfully prosecuted before the 2024 election, he could be knocked out of the race. </p><p>But from Trump’s point of view, these were bogus cases brought by biased prosecutors — James had won election by vowing to go after him — and backed by unfair judges for the sole purpose of keeping him out of the White House.</p><p>Joe Biden may have kept hands off — Jack Smith was named special counsel by AG Merrick Garland — but to the president it was all a grand left-wing conspiracy.</p><p>And that’s why Trump feels entitled to payback.</p><p>That’s why James Comey was just indicted, with Trump firing his own U.S. attorney who believed there wasn’t enough evidence, replacing him with a loyalist whose job was to charge the former FBI director.</p><p>That’s why Tish James is now under investigation for alleged mortgage fraud, </p><p>That’s why the Trump DOJ has just subpoenaed Fani Willis’ travel records from last year, and is investigating Sen. Adam Schiff.</p><p>To Donald Trump, this is all fully justified payback.</p><p>But he’s doing exactly what was done to him — going after political enemies — and doing it out in the open. He has ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue these cases, and fast, which is weaponizing the Justice Department against those he despises, in a way that no previous president has ever done. </p><p>He pronounces these targets \"guilty as hell\" — that alone would be a scandal in any other administration for prejudicing a trial — and celebrates the unveiling of indictments, such as calling Comey a \"sick person,\" a \"Dirty Cop\" and a \"SLIMEBALL.\"</p><p>So how does Trump justify doing what was done to him? He doesn’t. He’s never been big on consistency. And his MAGA base supports him no matter what.</p><p>Keep in mind that the perjury allegation — based on a vague exchange about a leak to the Wall Street Journal about the Clinton Foundation, ironically — was investigated by special counsel John Durham in the first term, and by the DOJ’s inspector general, and neither brought charges.</p><p>When Erik Seibert, the U.S. attorney in Virginia’s Eastern District, found insufficient evidence to charge Comey, Bondi pushed back in defense of the 15-year veteran, Still, Trump replaced him with White House aide and onetime beauty queen Lindsey Halligan, his former lawyer, who has never tried a criminal case. Halligan couldn’t even find the courtroom, and no prosecutor in the office agreed to accompany her, as is customary. Doesn’t matter. She had one job.</p><p>\"My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump,\" Comey said in a video.</p><p>Fourteen of the 23 grand jurors backed the two charges, just over the required minimum, and the jurors dismissed a proposed third count.</p><p>National Review’s Andy McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor, called the indictment \"so ill-conceived and incompetently drafted, he should be able to get it thrown out on a pretrial motion to dismiss.\"</p><p>Dan Abrams, ABC’s chief legal analyst (and founder of Mediaite) said on \"This Week\": \"I don’t even think that many in the Trump administration believe they’re going to get a conviction. I think that there’s a 95 percent-plus chance that there won’t be a conviction. That it’ll either get dismissed by a judge, there’ll be a hung jury, there’ll be an acquittal. But I’m not certain that that’s the end goal here.\" </p><p>In other words, making Comey’s life miserable and forcing him to pay legal fees may be satisfying enough.</p><p>Schiff, for his part, called the mortgage fraud allegation against him \"the kind of stuff you see tinpot dictators do.\" .</p><p>But there’s a larger issue here than the culpability of Comey and the others. As a former Justice Department reporter, I know all too well that presidents are not supposed to intervene in criminal investigations, and that dates to a series of post-Watergate reforms after Richard Nixon’s attorney general went to prison.</p><p>But Trump does all this out in the open. There’s no need to rely on unnamed sources. When he issued a memo demanding investigations of his foes, he made it public. </p><p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. He complained that \"nothing is being done,\" demanding that Bondi investigate Coney, James and Schiff. And now he’s talking about targeting Democratic donor and activist George Soros.</p><p>The president also has a knack for letting his allies off the hook. After New York Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on corruption charges, Trump ordered the case dropped. Then he tried to lure Adams out of the race by offering him a job, to boost the chances of defeating the man he calls \"Communist\" Zohran Mamdani. Adams, stuck in single digits, just dropped out, and don’t be surprised if he winds up as an ambassador.</p><p>When a deranged shooter in Michigan opened fire during a Mormon church service, and set the place on fire, killing at least four people, before being shot to death, Trump called it \"horrendous\" and called Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the killer hated Mormons.</p><p>The president called it \"another targeted attack on Christians.\"</p><p>What Trump and Leavitt neglected to mention is that the murderer has a Trump/Vance sign in front of his house.</p><p>So despite the president’s insistence that left-wingers are responsible for virtually all political violence, here’s a case where a right-winger, and Trump fan, is responsible for cold-blooded mass murder. But one day there will a Democrat in the White House again, ready to use the same tactics unleashed by Trump.</p><p>Dartmouth professor Brendan Nyhan, who heads a watchdog group, told the New York Times: \"Do Republicans want to give President AOC unilateral powers to determine which Defense Department programs she wants to fund?\"</p><p>His forthcoming report says \"50 percent of Democrats now support restricting or shutting down Fox News, up from 37 percent in 2021.\" I would find that chilling, even if I didn’t work at Fox. Where is it written that the government should be shutting down news outlets?</p><p>The larger point is this: Trump believes he’s entitled to payback because of all the indictments aimed at him. The Democrats believe Trump has shattered the wall that protected criminal probes from White House interference. And so we plunge into an endless cycle of retribution, with each administration investigating the previous one and justifying it as getting even for their own mistreatment. </p><p>: <i>The news conference that President Trump was going to hold with </i><i>Bibi Netanyahu</i><i> yesterday turned into a non-conference when Trump, of all people, refused to take questions — not even the traditional two from each side. So they each gave lengthy speeches and left.</i></p><p><i>But the president achieved something remarkable. He got Bibi to go along with his plan to end the </i><i>war in Gaza</i><i>. Trump even said he’d personally head a peace board designed to protect Israel’s security, that Hamas would release the remaining hostages, and mentioned Oct. 7.</i></p><p><i>Honestly, it was probably shrewd not to be distracted by questions.</i></p><p><i>Here’s the problem: </i><i>Hamas</i><i> hasn’t agreed to anything yet, and has stuck by its insistence on a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces before any hostages are released.

      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>Darren Waller turned back the clock on Monday night to help the Miami Dolphins vanquish the New York Jets, 27-21.</p><p>The one-time Pro Bowl tight end appeared in his first game for the Dolphins in the 2025 season after taking a year off from football following a stint with the New York Giants. He looked like his old self as he was able to carve up the Jets’ defense multiple times.</p><p>Waller caught two touchdown passes in a single game for the first time since he was with the Las Vegas Raiders in December 2020. He had his first touchdown catch since October 2023 when he was still with the Giants.</p><p>The first touchdown catch came in the second quarter. Tua Tagovailoa found a way to get the Dolphins into the red zone thanks to a creative flip to Malik Washington and easy throws to Tyreek Hill.</p><p>The second touchdown capped off a six-play, 36-yard drive in the third quarter. Tagovailoa found Waller for a 9-yard touchdown catch.</p><p>It had taken a bit for Waller to get back into game shape as he had been out of the league for more than a year. But, at least on Monday, the chance the Dolphins took on Waller paid off.</p><p>It wasn’t all smiles for the Dolphins.</p><p>Miami took a hit in the third quarter when Hill suffered a gruesome knee injury. Multiple reports indicated that the team feared he had dislocated his knee. If confirmed, it’s likely that he would be out for the remainder of the season.</p><p>Tagovailoa was 17-of-25 with 177 yards with the two touchdown passes. Running back De’Von Achane ran for 99 yards and a score.</p><p>Hill had six catches for 67 yards before he exited the game. Waller had three catches for 27 yards.</p><p>The Jets tried to get back into the game.</p><p>Justin Fields needed a miracle on 4th-and-1 in the third quarter. He was being chased around by the Dolphins defense and was able to avoid would-be tacklers to find a hole and burst through it. He scampered for a 43-yard touchdown to put some pressure on Miami.</p><p>The Jets nearly had a touchdown on a pass from Fields to Garrett Wilson. However, Wilson was called for offensive pass interference and it negated the score. New York had to settle for the field goal.</p><p>Wilson made up for it later in the night with an incredible catch and narrowly keeping himself in bounds.</p><p>But it was frustrating scenes for the Jets for the entire night.</p><p>New York committed 13 penalties for 101 yards along with three turnovers. Those penalties ultimately destroyed any momentum the offense would build up.</p><p>Fields was 20-of-27 with 227 passing yards and the touchdown pass to Wilson. He also led the team with 81 rushing yards.</p><p>Wilson finished with six catches for 82 yards.</p><p>The Jets have now lost 10 straight to the Dolphins in Miami.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>"

The ESPN broadcast showed a replay of the action. Hill’s leg was bent in a direction it shouldn’t have been, to put it simply. </p><p>Both medical staffs for the Jets and Dolphins made their way quickly to Hill, who was put into an air cast and placed on the back of a cart. He was seen smiling almost out of disbelief as the Dolphins crowd at Hard Rock Stadium cheered for their speedy wide receiver, who acknowledged them as the cart drove to the tunnel. </p><p>Hill was quickly ruled out of the game with what the Dolphins called a knee injury. Head coach Mike McDaniel confirmed after the Dolphins 27-21 win that Hill dislocated his knee. </p><p>He will remain in the hospital overnight, though he said Hill had an upbeat attitude despite what the future for this season at least holds. </p><p>A dislocated knee usually means that other ligaments were torn in the process, which would effectively end Hill’s season. The Dolphins will await a definitive diagnosis there, but it’s likely Hill’s cleat won’t be on anytime soon. </p><p>\"He is being taken to a local hospital for imaging, evaluation and observation,\" the Dolphins’ statement on X read. </p><p>Hill and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa were on the same page in this game, as No. 10 caught six passes for 67 yards to lead the Dolphins in that category before his injury. </p><p>Considering the seriousness of the injury, Hill’s 2025 season could be over. He has just 15 catches for 198 yards with one touchdown over four games this year. </p><p>The Dolphins came into this game against their AFC East foe struggling with an 0-3 record, as Mike McDaniel’s offense hadn’t been its usual electric self. </p><p>Hill had a slow start to the 2025 campaign, catching just four passes for 40 yards in a blowout loss to the Indianapolis Colts. He looked like his normal self, though, when he had 109 yards on six grabs in Week 2 against the New England Patriots. </p><p>Hill scored his first touchdown of the season last week on \"Thursday Night Football\" against the Buffalo Bills, where he had five catches for 49 yards.  </p><p>Hill is in his 10th NFL season, his fourth with the Dolphins after six with the Kansas City Chiefs.</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>"

He was booked 11 times between 2013 and 2025, facing multiple burglary and larceny charges. A first-degree burglary conviction in South Carolina carries a minimum 15-year prison sentence and up to life in prison.</p><p>Federico said the system gave Dickey more rights than his daughter ever had.</p><p>\"They cared more about making sure he wasn’t put in prison than worrying about whether or not he was going to hurt somebody,\" he said. \"His crimes escalated every time he made a new one. He finally graduated to the jackpot and executed our daughter. We’re still trying to hear from our South Carolina solicitor to see if he’s going to get the death penalty or not. Obviously, it checks all the boxes that it does.</p><p>\"But they’re more concerned about keeping criminals out of the prisons and institutions than they are to try to rehabilitate them.

The unit, which includes the U.S. Coast Guard, works with partner nations to disrupt the flow of illicit drugs through the \"transit zone\" between South America, Central America and the Caribbean and to weaken transnational criminal organizations.</p><p>According to the task force, the amount of drugs seized over the past 12 months is enough to fill 42 dump trucks. The 2025 fiscal year ends Tuesday. </p><p>JIATF-S confirmed to Fox News Digital that the effort has denied cartels and narco-terrorists $11.34 billion in revenue and removed 377.9 million lethal doses from the streets.</p><p>JIATF-S operates across 42 million square miles, from the Eastern Pacific to the Western Atlantic, stretching from international waters north of the Caribbean Antilles to the southern tip of South America at Cape Horn.</p><p>The region has long been a major trafficking corridor for drugs, arms, cash and people. Well-financed and sophisticated criminal networks continue to exploit the area, officials said.</p><p>\"By disrupting the flow of these deadly drugs, JIATF-S is saving lives and protecting our homeland,\" the agency added.</p><p>A seizure of this magnitude has never been accomplished before. Officials said the one million pounds of cocaine does not include the strikes on Venezuelan narco-terrorists.</p><p>The Trump administration has vowed to intensify military action in the Caribbean as part of its counter-narcotics strategy.</p><p>In recent months, U.S. forces have conducted multiple operations targeting smuggling vessels as President Donald Trump pushed to crack down on cartels and stem the flow of cocaine and other illicit drugs into the United States.</p><p>In February, Trump designated groups, including Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel as foreign terrorist organizations. The Justice Department has also offered a $50 million reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.</p><p>Maduro is accused by U.S. authorities of helping lead the Cartel of the Suns, a Venezuelan drug-trafficking network allegedly comprised of senior government and military officials.</p><p>\"As he gained power in Venezuela, Maduro participated in a corrupt and violent narco-terrorism conspiracy with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization,\" a State Department bulletin states. </p><p>Prosecutors allege Maduro helped arrange multi-ton shipments of FARC-produced cocaine and directed the Cartel of the Suns to provide the group with military-grade weapons.</p><p>In August, Trump approved the deployment of several U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyers to strengthen counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean.</p><p>Maduro responded by declaring that Venezuela was ready to resist any attacks, calling the move \"an extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\" He has accused Trump of orchestrating a broader campaign to overthrow his government.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Diana Stancy contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>"

      "description": "Prosecutors allege Sarah Hartsfield injected her diabetic husband Joseph with excessive insulin and delayed calling 911, leading to his death in January 2023.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>Jury selection has begun in the high-profile murder trial of Sarah Hartsfield, the Texas woman accused of killing her fifth husband with insulin. </p><p>The proceedings mark the latest chapter in a case that has gripped Texas as the 50-year-old faces accusations that she murdered her husband, Joseph Hartsfield, in January 2023. Hartsfield pleaded not guilty.</p><p>According to a grand jury indictment, filed in February 2023, prosecutors allege she \"intentionally and knowingly cause[d] the death of an individual, namely Joseph Hartsfield, by a manner and means unknown to the grand jury.\" </p><p>Joseph's obituary says he died in a hospital \"due to complications of an ischemic stroke, with his loving wife at his side.\" Hartsfield is currently in custody at the Chambers County Jail in Texas and is held on a reduced bond of $2 million. </p><p>Prosecutors allege that Hartsfield, an Army veteran, used her husband’s diabetes to cover up a homicide, allegedly injecting him with dangerous amounts of insulin and delaying calling 911 for several hours. </p><p>Joseph was taken to a hospital and died days later. Investigators later uncovered multiple insulin pens near his bedside and questioned inconsistencies in Hartsfield’s statements.</p><p>\"I appreciate the hard work of the deputies and detectives who followed their instincts and identified the suspicious circumstances surrounding Mr. Hartsfield’s death that could have been labeled as ‘death due to illness’ instead of murder,\" Sheriff Brian Hawthorne said at the time of her arrest.</p><p>The defense has argued that Joseph’s death may have been a tragic complication of his own medical condition rather than a deliberate act by his wife. Part of what makes the case complex is Hartsfield’s marital history. The now 48-year-old has been married five times. </p><p>Hartsfield’s first marriage was to her high school sweetheart, Titus Knoernschild. The couple married young, but the relationship soon soured. Knoernschild told ABC13 Houston that Sarah threatened him during their separation, warning him not to be surprised if he didn’t survive their divorce. According to the local outlet, they divorced by 1995, but he said she continued to harass him for years afterward, including showing up at his Fort Hood office in 2008 until he obtained a no-contact order.</p><p>She went on to marry her second husband in the mid-1990s. According to ABC13, Sarah was arrested in March 1996 for allegedly assaulting him during a dispute at their Rio Bonito home. The charge was dropped after about a week, ABC13 reported.</p><p>By the late 1990s, Sarah had remarried, and her third marriage eventually ended in divorce in 2018. Around that time, she became engaged to David Bragg in Minnesota. On May 9, 2018, Sarah shot and killed Bragg in his home. She told investigators that he fired at her first and that she returned fire. Douglas County prosecutors ruled the killing a justifiable act of self-defense at the time, according to FOX9 Minneapolis. </p><p>Not long after Bragg’s death, Sarah married her fourth husband around 2019. That marriage also ended in divorce by 2021.</p><p>Sarah’s fifth marriage was to Joseph Hartsfield, whom she wed in 2022. Friends and neighbors told Click2Houston that Joseph was unhappy in the marriage and had been planning to leave. On Jan. 7, 2023, Joseph was found unresponsive after a diabetic emergency.</p><p>Prosecutors allege Sarah injected him with excessive insulin and delayed calling 911. He died days later. The Harris County Medical Examiner ruled the cause of death as complications from toxic insulin exposure.</p><p>In February 2023, Sarah was arrested and indicted for Joseph’s murder. </p><p>Her trial is scheduled to begin on Tuesday with opening statements after jury selection.</p></body></div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>After an illegal alien, Ian Andre Roberts, the superintendent of the Des Moines Public Schools in Iowa, was arrested by ICE, Republicans blew the whistle on the fact that he was a registered active Democrat voter in the state of Maryland.</p><p>According to the official website for the Maryland State Board of Elections, Roberts, who overstayed a student visa from 1999, has an active voter status and is registered as a Democrat in Maryland. The development was first reported on by columnist Dustin Grage.</p><p>Republican state Delegate Matt Morgan, who is chair of the Maryland House Freedom Caucus, told Fox News Digital that Roberts’ registration means that he is eligible to vote in all federal, state and local elections despite not being a U.S. citizen, and also despite likely not having lived in Maryland for the past decade.</p><p>Morgan explained that there is nothing in Maryland law allowing for non-citizens to be registered to vote in federal or state elections even if Roberts were still a legal resident.</p><p>Now, the House Freedom Caucus is demanding answers from the Maryland State Board of Elections about \"gaping holes\" in the state’s election integrity systems.</p><p>In a letter sent to the elections board on Monday, the Freedom Caucus also demanded answers on why the board has been \"obstructing a valid request by the Department of Justice to ensure compliance with federal election laws, citing immigration enforcement as a primary concern.</p><p>Morgan pointed to a letter the elections board sent to the Justice Department in August in which State Administrator of Elections Jared DeMarinis expressed concern that if the board gave over voter information to the federal government that data would be used for \"used for enforcement of immigration laws against Maryland residents.\"  </p><p>Commenting on the letter, Morgan asked, \"If illegal aliens are not allowed to vote, why would they be on the voter rolls in the first place? And how would that enhance immigration enforcement? I don't know, but that's the excuse that they wrote to the DOJ.\"</p><p>\"It's ridiculous,\" he went on, adding that \"everyone reasonable wants a safe and secure election.\"</p><p>Before his arrest by ICE, Roberts headed the Des Moines Public Schools, the largest school district in the state, despite not being legally authorized to work in the U.S. after his employment authorization card expired in 2020, according to authorities.</p><p>He was taken into custody on a fugitive warrant last week. ICE agents arrested Roberts after he attempted to flee and was found hiding in brush. The vehicle Roberts was driving was found with $3,000 in cash, a fixed-blade hunting knife, and a loaded Glock 19 firearm, ICE said.</p><p>Roberts also had illegal weapons possession charges from 2020 and was given a final order of removal in 2024.</p><p>The state of Iowa revoked Roberts' education license on Sunday, triggering the Des Moines School Board to place him on unpaid leave.</p><p>\"We were notified that the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked Doctor Roberts' license to practice as a superintendent in the state of Iowa. Without such a license, Doctor Roberts is not in compliance with his contract,\" said Jackie Norris, chair of the school board.</p><p>Morgan said that though Roberts’ case is baffling, he fears he may just be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to illegal aliens registered to vote in Maryland.</p><p>\"We have no idea how widespread this is. We hear rumors, but we have no idea,\" he said.</p><p>\"This is uncharted territory,\" he added.</p></body></div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>A blogger has blasted British police after they arrested him for sharing a meme on social media that read \"F--- Hamas.\"</p><p>Pete North, 47, filmed officers arriving at his Yorkshire home in the U.K. on Sept. 25 and telling him he was being detained because he had \"posted something on the internet\" that a member of their hate crime team \"didn’t appreciate.\" </p><p>The shocking footage shows an officer explaining that North was being arrested \"on suspicion of publishing or distributing written material intended to stir up racial hatred.\"</p><p>The post in question had been shared by North on X in August and featured a Palestinian flag with the words: \"F--- Palestine. F--- Hamas. F--- Islam. Want to protest? F--- off to Muslim country and protest.\"</p><p>North confirmed to The Telegraph that although the meme contained offensive references to Palestine and Islam, officers in the interview at the station appeared preoccupied with the part directed at Hamas.</p><p>\"The officer in the interview said, ‘Well, firstly, let’s start with the meme. You posted a meme that said f--- Hamas,’\" North recalled to the British outlet.</p><p>\"I said, ‘yeah, I did post a meme that said f--- Hamas, because Hamas are a proscribed terrorist organisation internationally, including in Britain'.\"</p><p>He added: \"I then asked him, ‘Just so we’re on the same page, you do know who Hamas are?’ And he just… shook his head. He looked totally blank. If you’re going to arrest people for memes, you probably need to pay more attention to current affairs.\"</p><p>North told The Telegraph he pressed the officer on whether he was aware of Hamas’s atrocities, including the murder of civilians on October 7. \"He was totally oblivious,\" North claimed.</p><p>After being questioned for several hours, North was released without charge. </p><p>\"I feel quite strongly that what political cartoons and memes I post on social media is none of the police’s business,\" North said.</p><p>\"Nobody should be facing police inquiries for posting memes on Twitter. The whole point of this exercise is not to win convictions. It’s to terrorize people like me into thinking twice about posting spicy memes,\" he added.</p><p>North Yorkshire Police confirmed the arrest, telling UK media: \"A 47-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of publishing or distributing written material intended to stir up racial hatred. He has been released under investigation while inquiries continue.\"</p><p><i>Fox News Digital has reached out to North Yorkshire Police for comment.</i></p></body></div></body></html>"
