      "description": "Despite Rubio&apos;s praise for Mexico&apos;s crime-fighting efforts, concerns persist about the Mexican government&apos;s longstanding relationships with criminal cartels.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>\"[T]here’s no other government,\" said the United States secretary of State, \"that’s cooperating as much with us in the fight against crime as the Government of Mexico.\" Issued several days ago from the Palacio Nacional in Mexico City, with the uppermost tier of Mexico’s political elite beaming approvingly, it was a bold statement for Marco Rubio to make.  </p><p>It’s a big win for them, in their desperation to ward off what they see as a series of worst-case outcomes, among them tariffs, the end of United States–Mexico–Canada trade agreement (USMCA), American extraditions of their cartel-connected political class, and U.S. military strikes in their country. In this context, the praise from Rubio — perceived as a Latin America hawk in general — comes as a tremendous relief. They will, at minimum, wield it as validation the next time any other American suggests Mexico isn’t doing enough.  </p><p>From Mexico’s perspective, it is nearly a get-out-of-jail-free card. The question is what, exactly, it means.  </p><p>To borrow a phrase, Rubio’s affirmation is \"big, if true.\" It is so big, in fact, that it begs a great many questions — none of them answered or answerable in the public sphere. As longtime observers of Mexican affairs know, exemplary cooperation with the United States has not been a hallmark of Mexican governance for well over a decade now.  </p><p>What used to be an exceptionally close security relationship was first dented under the Mexican presidency of Enrique Peña Nieto, from 2012-2018, and then almost totally severed under his successor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, from 2018-2024. Peña Nieto presided over a political structure shot through with corruption, and Lopez Obrador, himself, reportedly has had a long relationship with the Sinaloa Cartel for at least the past 20 years.  </p><p>All this combined to produce a Mexican state that was an antagonist, not a partner, to the United States — a narco-state in all but name, and moreover an active ally of hemispheric dictatorships including the ones in Cuba and Venezuela.  </p><p>The present administration of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Lopez Obrador’s handpicked successor, has labored to present a different image, if not necessarily a different reality, for American consumption. Threatened early by the Trump administration with American military action against its allied cartels, Sheinbaum’s regime did several things that the Mexican state could have done all along, including closing the border and extraditing narcos by the dozen.  </p><p>All these measures are necessary, from the American perspective — and also tactical at best. What it has never done, as far as we know, is address the strategic problem undergirding all the rest: the longstanding collusion between the regime and its criminal cartels. </p><p>That collusion is neither minor nor the mere background noise of Mexican civics. It is rather fundamental to the MORENA regime — the political party of both Lopez Obrador and Sheinbaum — and has been essential to the consolidation of its power. Nearly unnoticed in American policy discourse, that regime has been busily transforming Mexican society into an autocratic left-populist state akin to that which unfolded to disastrous effect in Venezuela.  </p><p>In this framework, cartel money and guns have been essential in delivering elections, curbing independent public life and enriching key powerholders, by which the coalition holds together. It is an open secret in today’s Mexico that though Sheinbaum herself is likely not corrupt — she is that most fleeting phenomenon in Latin America, the pure ideologue — her regime is stacked with those who are. There are recipients of cartel funds in Mexico’s Senate, Congress, governorships and beyond. </p><p>These men and women are the fulcrum, the essential link, between Mexico’s state and its cartels, and until they are dealt with, any arrangement with Mexico — no matter how quiet the border is, and no matter how many narcos are sent north — is temporary. The problem is unsolved so long as the state-cartel alliance remains in effect.  </p><p>This is also precisely the class of culpable figures that Sheinbaum has left untouched, and unworried by anything like justice. Absent that action, it is quite difficult to say that \"there is no other government that is cooperating as much with [America] against criminality than the Mexican government.\" Yet Secretary Rubio did say that, and so we return to the original question: why? </p><p>We must be open to three major possibilities.  </p><p>One is that the United States is treading the well-worn pathway of showering the Mexicans with unearned praise, in the hopes of appealing to their better natures. This is a dreary norm in our communications with them — which never yields the hoped-for outcomes — and we should be open to the possibility that more of the same is at work here.  </p><p>Another possibility is that the current level of cooperation, such as it is, is deemed sufficient by the United States, and we are content with leaving Mexico’s fundamental strategic problem unaddressed. This would be a tremendous error — a worse crisis is therefore an inevitability — but there is a constituency for it within the American bureaucracy. </p><p>The final possibility, and the one for which we hope, is that the secretary of State is dead-on right — and there is much more underway behind the scenes than we know. Perhaps real action against Mexico’s narco-state apparatus is forthcoming, and both the Americans and President Sheinbaum are in on it.  </p><p>We can hope for it, and we do, but at some point, we have to know. Inside Mexico policy circles, a conversational commonplace is that we won’t know until 2028 or so, at the opening of Sheinbaum’s second half of her six-year term — not at all coincidentally, right at the point at which the accountability brought by the Trump administration will be in its final months. If this is the case, it isn’t enough. </p><p>What Americans need, in validation of the secretary of State’s rhetoric, is a visible signal now. Sheinbaum, if she is a good-faith partner, need not risk her regime or her life with an immediate assault on her cartel-partner regime elements — but she can affirm the analysis, and the principles of action that come from it. She can recognize reality and say so. She is fond of proclaiming her dedication to Mexico’s soberania — its sovereignty — and now she has the opportunity to declare that soberania includes sovereignty from the cartels, its agents and its partners … no matter how high up in government they go.  </p><p>We on the American side need it. We want to trust — but we must verify.  </p></body></div></body></html>"

      "description": "China controls 70% of global rare earth mining and 90% of refining capacity, using these materials as leverage in trade negotiations with the United States.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and Commerce Minister Li Chenggang in Madrid last week. They announced a \"framework agreement\" over TikTok, the Chinese-owned app used by millions of Americans. </p><p>But the story isn’t only about TikTok. It’s also about how America uses TikTok as a lever – and why that lever is more necessary than ever.</p><p>TikTok is an important issue in and of itself: control over data, algorithmic influence, foreign ownership – all of which are critical for national security. In addition, however, TikTok is a tool the U.S. can and should use in ongoing trade engagement, as well as to counter China’s growing leverage in rare earths, critical minerals and semiconductors.</p><p>When I served in President Donald Trump’s first administration (\"Trump 45\"), the core issues we confronted included a massive trade imbalance, intellectual property theft, cyber-theft and China’s Belt and Road infrastructure expansion. These were predatory practices in trade, tech and finance. Today, in \"Trump 47,\" the battlefront has broadened – but one thing that hasn’t changed is the psychological warfare the Chinese employ any time negotiations are underway.</p><p>I was at the center of one of the most dramatic examples of this during Trump 45… </p><p>After an exhausting month of prep work, I boarded my flight to Beijing in March 2018 with wary optimism. I had worked intensively leading up to this trip, drafting a comprehensive framework document outlining a new trade deal with China, a proposal that would overhaul virtually every aspect of the U.S.-China economic relationship.</p><p>We’d sent the proposal to our Chinese counterparts several days earlier, and now our high-level trade delegation was en route to Beijing to negotiate the largest change to trade relations in at least 10 years. The cast of characters illustrates just how significant this trade deal could be. It included Secretary Steven Mnuchin (head of the delegation), Under Secretary David Malpass and me (Treasury), Secretary Wilbur Ross (Commerce), U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and several of his deputies, NEC Director Larry Kudlow, Under Secretary Ted McKinney (Agriculture), and Peter Navarro (special assistant to the president and director of trade and manufacturing policy).</p><p>We arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing with about an hour to review our plans one more time before we had to depart for Diaoyutai – the state guest house where Mao and every leader since has entertained foreign dignitaries. But there was a surprise waiting for us at our embassy:a brand-new proposal, drafted by the Chinese, which they were putting forth at the eleventh hour, and which we had never seen. It was about 15 pages long – and completely in Chinese!</p><p>I was one of the few people in the room who could read it. After a quick scan, I told the group: \"This is wholly unacceptable. This document doesn’t say anything – they’re just messing with us.\" A heated debate ensued over how to respond, and how the Chinese were likely to react. But there was no time to reach a consensus; it was time to leave for Diaoyutai.</p><p>There was a mass exit from the secure room where we met at the embassy, and, almost like a well-choreographed ballet with a hundred moving parts, we all shuffled to our designated cars. As Secretary Mnuchin stepped into the limousine to take us to the meeting, Malpass insisted that I ride with the secretary and pushed me into the seat next to Mnuchin, saying, \"We need to know exactly what this says – can you translate it on the way?\"</p><p>As we sped through the streets of Beijing, I sat in the back seat, literally shvitzing as a technical term in Chinese got the better of me, and furiously translated as I read out loud, in English, what the Chinese had dropped in our laps.</p><p>Even as we climbed the stairs into the building and entered the meeting room, none of us was quite sure how Mnuchin was going to handle this hot potato. After Vice Premier Liu He’s flowing stream of diplomatic pleasantries welcoming us to China, the secretary calmly stated in response, \"We received your draft. Thanks for sending it over – but we’re going to use our draft for today.\" It wasn’t the preamble they expected. But it was entirely consistent with the new tone that President Trump had set from the day he took office.</p><p>Today, China has moved from using tariffs and IP theft to controlling choke points – especially in rare earth elements, critical minerals, semiconductors and advanced manufacturing capacity. The numbers are clear indicators of China’s leverage. </p><p>China accounts for about 70 % of global rare earth mining and about 90 % of the world’s rare earth refining and separation capacity. In 2023, China controlled 61 % of global mining of rare earth magnet elements and 92 % of refining capacity for those magnets. </p><p>On semiconductors: while U.S. companies remain strong in chip design and advanced R&amp;D, China’s share of the semiconductor industry’s value-added has surged (from about 8 % in 2001 to over 30 % by 2016), and China is pushing aggressively to become self-sufficient in mature node production.</p><p>These are not passive metrics. They are active levers China already uses in the trade negotiations through export restrictions, licensing controls or by threatening disruptions. For example, in April 2025 China – clearly in response to President Trump’s bold tariff moves – added export licenses and restrictions for seven heavy rare earth elements, including dysprosium, terbium, samarium, plus rare earth magnets—materials critical to EV motors, wind turbines, electronics and defense systems.</p><p>The challenges faced in Trump’s first term have only evolved – not eased. The trade deficit is large, IP and tech theft are growing more dangerous, predatory development finance practices continue and China’s leverage in rare earths, semiconductors and control over supply chains threatens global development and American autonomy.</p><p>TikTok is a headline issue impacting critical issues of data, influence and national security. But it is also an essential lever to counter the new pressure points China is pressing. Madrid and Friday’s Trump–Xi call offer a chance to reshape this broader contest. </p><p>As I demonstrate in \"A Seat at the Table,\" President Trump’s strategy and policies during his first administration allowed us to exert maximum pressure on our counterparts and to stay the course with firm negotiating positions and clear red lines. Last week’s dialogues demonstrate that Trump will continue to insist on substance over symbolism, an approach critical to our national interest. </p></body></div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>- The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Wednesday launched a new digital ad campaign spotlighting what it calls President Donald Trump's \"ongoing attacks on free speech\" following last week's suspension of comedian Jimmy Kimmel from his late-night TV perch.</p><p>The spots, which will target a handful of House Republicans in swing districts who face challenging re-elections in next year's midterms, will run on conservative and independent media, including the podcasts of media superstars Joe Rogan and Ben Shapiro, who are very popular among younger and male audiences.</p><p>The campaign, shared first with Fox News Digital, comes in the wake of ABC's move last week to pull Kimmel's late-night talk show off the air after his remarks about the alleged assassin of Charlie Kirk sparked outrage and a veiled threat from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).</p><p>The suspension of Kimmel sparked outrage among Democrats and progressives, and even some high-profile conservatives, who said the late-night host was being punished for exercising freedom of speech. Many Republicans countered that Kimmel's comments suggesting Kirk's suspected killer was a MAGA member were outrageous and false. </p><p>ABC reinstated Kimmel on Monday and his program returned to air Tuesday night, although the roughly 60 affiliated stations owned by Nextar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group preempted the program.</p><p>\"The American people don't support attacks on free speech, which is why Trump is losing support among independent and conservative voters,\" the DNC argued in a statement. \"The Republican base is fracturing, with Republican figures including Megyn Kelly, Ted Cruz, and Ben Shapiro loudly breaking with the administration.\"</p><p>The DNC ad includes a clip of Trump, during the first week of his second administration, announcing that \"on day one I signed an executive order to stop all government censorship.\"</p><p>The narrator in the spot later charged that \"Trump wants to control what you see so he can control what you think.\" </p><p>The DNC says the campaign, which is backed by a modest five figures, will target the congressional districts of Republican Reps. Rob Wittman of Virginia, Jen Kiggans of Virginia, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, and Tom Kean Jr. of New Jersey.</p><p>\"It’s clear Donald Trump only cares about silencing his critics — and now, voters across the country and in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey are going to hear about it,\" the DNC claimed.</p><p>Trump and many of his top allies, long advocates of free speech, have criticized people who have been critical of Kirk since the conservative activist's assassination earlier this month.</p><p>The president welcomed ABC's decision to initially pull Kimmel off the air indefinitely. And Trump also suggested axing the broadcast licenses of networks who, in his opinion, treat him too negatively.</p><p>DNC Chair Ken Martin, in a statement to Fox News, said, \"Donald Trump’s administration has amassed a chilling record of restricting speech, extorting private companies, and dropping the full weight of the government censorship hammer on Americans simply exercising their First Amendment rights. This is no exaggeration, and it’s splintering the coalition that got Trump elected.\"</p><p>Martin claimed that Trump is \"attempting to silence people. It’s un-American, and Democrats won’t stand for it.\"</p><p>Republicans and conservatives,during the administrations of Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden railed against what they considered were efforts to muzzle free speech, attacking Democrats for pushing \"cancel culture.\"</p><p>Trump and his allies are now defending their latest actions by saying that \"consequence culture\" is replacing \"cancel culture.\"</p><p><i>Fox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>"

      "description": "Recent Russian incursions into Estonian and Polish airspace highlight need for coordinated Western response and increased military support for Eastern Europe.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>Russian fighter jets recently entered Estonian airspace – a bold incursion that came just nine days after 19 Russian drones swarmed the airspace of fellow NATO member Poland. While the Kremlin has denied any intentional violations of NATO airspace, the evidence suggests that both actions were almost certainly deliberate. </p><p>These provocations appear to have been designed to test NATO for both operational and political weakness, and to tell the world that Vladimir Putin believes he can behave with impunity in Ukraine and beyond. Indeed, all of Putin’s recent feints toward peace have been belied by his actions: He followed up his Alaska summit with President Trump in Alaska with the largest aerial attacks on Ukraine of the past year, and ignored the ceasefire deadline offered by the president. </p><p>As NATO continues its deliberations on a coordinated response to the Polish incident and now Estonia, a unified, decisive and robust rebuke from the entire alliance is of paramount importance. The Western alliance failed to deter Russia in 2014, and again in 2022; with Putin now taking the fight even further into European territory, we cannot afford to show any weakness. </p><p>The U.S. and our European allies must show Putin that his acts of aggression will not stand, and that for every escalation and provocation, the costs to him will only multiply. </p><p>NATO is already taking action to strengthen the defense of its eastern flank – a salutary measure, but just one piece of the puzzle. The proposed withdrawal of U.S. military support in the Baltics would send a disastrous signal to the Kremlin, particularly given the incursion into Estonian airspace. </p><p>Congress and the administration should work together to ensure that the U.S. military presence in the frontline Baltic states remains in place as a key component of NATO’s defensive architecture. America and our allies in Europe should take additional steps to bolster the defensive capabilities of NATO’s eastern frontier, forge ahead with iron-clad security guarantees to Ukraine, and provide Kyiv with the defensive and offensive weapons it needs to put Russia on the back foot. </p><p>We also need to make it clear that Russia has torpedoed any prospects for peace talks for the foreseeable future. President Donald Trump has made a good faith effort to facilitate negotiations, but Putin has made it eminently clear that he has no interest in peace. Continuing to indulge the fiction that he wants what we want – or worse, that there is any kind of equivalence between Russia as the belligerent party, and Ukraine, the victim of Russian aggression – only buys Putin time and leverage. </p><p>Next, as President Trump has made clear, Europe needs to stop buying Russian oil and gas – now. It’s absurd that after more than three years, some European countries are continuing to supply Russia with the revenue it needs to conduct this brutal war on their own continent. What’s more, with President Trump leading America back to energy dominance, Europe will have alternative suppliers to turn to – avoiding price hikes while cutting off precious funding for Putin’s war effort. </p><p>The president is also correct to push for a coordinated campaign of financial pressure on Russia and its enablers. This should include sanctioning the Chinese banks that keep the Kremlin’s war machine moving, imposing crushing tariffs and secondary sanctions on the countries that are keeping the Kremlin afloat through oil, gas, and uranium purchases. Congress should work to pass the bipartisan bill put forward by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., which includes the measures outlined above as well as expanded restrictions on Russian financial entities and transactions and the Russian energy sector. </p><p>President Trump understands that peace can only be secured through strength. It’s why he pushed for Europe to assume greater responsibility for its own security in both his first and second administrations. As the former secretary of state, I know from experience that this insistence wasn’t always welcome – but as we all know, it turned out to be prescient. The president’s willingness to have those difficult conversations with our European allies has resulted in the landmark commitment of 5% GDP defense spending for NATO members – putting the alliance back on track to reestablish deterrence and restore Europe’s territorial integrity. </p><p>America must see that project through. It is critical to Europe’s security, and to America’s core interests, that we get this right – and that can only be done by imposing serious costs on Russia, and by showing Putin that his provocations have only strengthened the NATO alliance. </p></body></div></body></html>"

Tish James is \"very guilty of something.\"</p><p>What’s more, \"he didn’t quit, I fired him!\"</p><p>It’s a blip of a story, compared to Trump and his team naming a special prosecutor to again investigate Russiagate allegations from 2016; dropping corruption charges against New York’s Mayor Eric Adams, and suspending security clearances for the law firm that Robert Mueller left four years ago (later blocked by a judge).</p><p>The larger point is that perhaps we’ve become inured to the serious spectacle of a president not just interfering with the Justice Department but literally dictating who should be charged and who should be protected.</p><p>Trump told Pam Bondi over the weekend, \"They impeached me twice, and indicted me (five times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\" </p><p>He said he believes James, Comey and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff are \"all guilty as hell\" but that nothing is being done.</p><p>As someone who used to roam the halls of the Justice Department — and covered three independent counsels involving Ronald Reagan’s AG, Ed Meese — I am acutely aware of the ethical boundaries. </p><p>After the Watergate scandal, which included Attorney General John Mitchell going to prison, led to reforms, the idea of a wall between the White House and DOJ was further cemented. </p><p>Joe Biden saw any involvement in criminal probes as radioactive, and no evidence of his tampering has surfaced (though he did pardon a bunch of allies, including his son).</p><p>There was a huge uproar back when Bill Clinton had a chance tarmac meeting with his AG, Loretta Lynch, while his wife was under investigation over her private email server. She said they talked about grandchildren and travel. A CBS reporter called the meeting \"absolutely shocking.\" </p><p>But you don’t have to rely on unnamed sources to learn about Trump giving his attorney general marching orders. He broadcasts it, even boasts about it.</p><p>Of course, Trump stretching his executive powers goes well beyond DOJ. There are his funding freezes against universities, dispatching of the National Guard in D.C. and elsewhere, and attempting to fire members of supposedly independent agencies such as the Federal Reserve.</p><p>The escalation against the media has been nothing short of stunning. Trump cheered ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel against the backdrop of FCC Chairman Brendan Carr threatening to take action against its local licenses. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" he said, prompting some conservatives to say he sounded like a mafioso.</p><p>Trump won a $16 million settlement from ABC over George Stephanopoulos saying Trump had been held liable for \"rape,\" not sexual abuse. He also won $16 million from CBS over the biased editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris. </p><p>It just so happens that Nexstar, which preempted Kimmel and owns many CBS affiliates, needs administration approval to take over Tegna, another media conglomerate.</p><p>Trump filed suit against the Wall Street Journal for reporting he’d sent a birthday message to Jeffrey Epstein with a silhouette of a naked woman–and when that surfaced with what closely resembled his signature, continued to deny he had done it.</p><p>And then there is his $15 billion suit against the New York Times, which a judge threw out after just four days for its \"inexcusable\" breaking of the rules in a filing filled with \"vituperation.\" It’s a strange suit because it wasn’t triggered by any particular story, just a general charge that the Times campaign coverage was illegal, including a Harris endorsement that ran on the front page.</p><p>Even the largest corporations have to spend big bucks to defend such suits, which is sort of the point.</p><p>But nothing is as sensitive and powerful as law enforcement, whose officials can shield allies and prosecute opponents.</p><p>The president’s position is that DOJ was weaponized against him during the Biden administration, and therefore he’s entitled to payback.</p><p>The latest news just broke. The Justice Department was investigating border czar Tom Homan for allegedly offering to help win federal contracts to businessmen — who were actually undercover FBI agents — in exchange for $50,000.</p><p>But as MSNBC reports, Trump’s DOJ dropped the case after he took office.Since the hidden-camera encounter took place before Trump was elected, when Homan was a private citizen, I could argue he was just doing what hundreds of lobbyists do. Except for one nagging detail — Homan took the 50K in cash, in a Cava fast-food bag. No paper trail.</p><p>And yet Pam Bondi’s department gave him a pass.</p><p>Prosecutors in every administration must make difficult judgment calls about whether they have enough evidence to convict, especially against government officials or high-profile figures. </p><p>And next time there’s a Democrat in the White House, what’s to stop that person from playing the same kind of hardball, saying their party was entitled to payback? The cycles could be endless.</p><p>As for now, it would be easier to have confidence in these prosecution decisions if the president wasn’t openly calling the shots. </p></body></div></body></html>"

Jimmy! Jimmy!\" and ongoing cheering.</p><p>\"If you are just joining us, we are preempting your regularly scheduled encore episode of 'Celebrity Family Feud,' we’re bringing you this special report,\" Kimmel opened. \"I’m happy to be here with you tonight.\" </p><p>He went on to thank his fellow late-night talk show hosts, including Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart and David Letterman, along with right-leaning critics like Clay Travis and Sen.

If you don’t, you don’t. I have no illusions about changing anyone’s mind. But I want to make something clear, because it’s important to me as a human, and that is – you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man.\"</p><p>Kimmel began tearing up as he said he posted a message to Instagram sending love to Kirk's family the day of his death.</p><p>\"Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions,\" he continued. \"It was a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make, but I understand that, to some, it felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both, and for those who think I did point a finger, I get why you’re upset.

I don’t think the murderer who shot Charlie Kirk represents anyone. This was a sick person who believed violence was a solution, and it isn’t ever.\"</p><p>Kimmel also gave his mixed thoughts on Disney suspending his show after 23 years on the air.</p><p>\"Every night, they defended my right to poke fun at our leaders and to advocate for subjects that I think are important by allowing me to use their platform, and I'm very grateful for that.

I shared my point of view, they shared theirs. We talked it through.

I don’t know if you saw this. On Sunday, Erika Kirk forgave the man who shot her husband. She forgave him. That is an example we should follow. If you believe in the teachings of Jesus, as I do, there it was. That’s it. A selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow. It touched me deeply, and I hope it touches many, and if there’s anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, I hope it can be that,\" Kimmel said.</p><p>Kimmel’s show was suspended by Disney last Wednesday after he said right-wing commentators were \"desperately\" trying to characterize Kirk’s alleged assassin as someone who wasn’t \"MAGA.\"</p><p>\"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\" Kimmel said on Sept. 15.</p><p>Broadcasting companies Sinclair Broadcasting Group and Nexstar Media Group announced after the episode aired that they would be preempting the show across dozens of ABC affiliates because of Kimmel’s \"ill-timed and insensitive\" comments. </p><p>Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr also made a veiled threat against the show following backlash from the comments.</p><p>Sinclair and Nexstar preempted Kimmel’s show again Tuesday night and have said they will keep doing so as discussions with ABC continue behind the scenes.</p><p>Ahead of Kimmel's return, President Donald Trump attacked both Kimmel and ABC for bringing the show back despite being told that it was \"canceled.\"</p><p>\"I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back.

Democrats enjoy a nearly two-to-one voter registration advantage over Republicans in the Hispanic-majority district, which stretches from Yuma to Tucson and includes almost the entire length of the state's border with Mexico.</p><p>Once Grijalva is seated, Republicans will control the House 219-214, with two vacant seats remaining. </p><p>There's a vacancy in Texas 18th Congressional District, a heavily Democrat-dominated district in Houston, following the March death of Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner.

Mark Green stepped down in July to take a job in the private sector, is also currently vacant. The special election to fill the seat will be held on December 2.</p><p>Grijalva, thanks in part to her family name and her support from national progressive rock stars, Sen.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, grabbed over 60% of the primary vote this summer in a five-candidate showdown.</p><p>Progressive activist and social media influencer Deja Foxx came in a distant second.</p><p>Grijalva, who with her victory became Arizona's first Latina in Congress, targeted President Donald Trump as she campaigned,</p><p>\"In Congress, I commit to fight Trump’s cruel agenda, like the Big Ugly Bill that took away coverage from nearly 383,000 Arizonans and 142,000 children,\" Grijalva pledged in a social media post, as she took aim at Trump, congressional Republicans, and their sweeping domestic policy measure that they named the One Big Beautiful Bill.</p><p>Grijalva had also said that if she won, she would immediately sign a discharge petition by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky. The petition, which is currently just one vote shy of passing, calls on the GOP-controlled House to vote to urge the Justice Department to release the files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>Butierez, as he campaigned, had been promoting himself as the change candidate in a district controlled by Democrats since the seat was created over two decades ago.</p><p>\"This is your chance to actually get a Representative who will represent everyone. If you vote we win, if you don't only the radicals will have representation,\" he wrote on X.</p><p>Butierez, who as the 2024 GOP congressional nominee lost to the elder Grijalva while Trump narrowly carried the southwestern battleground state at the top of the ballot, easily won this summer's Republican primary in the special election.</p><p>While Trump carried Arizona last year after losing it in 2020, 2024 Democratic presidential nominee and then-Vice President Kamala Harris won the district by 23 points. </p><p>Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin, in a statement after the race was called, said that \"Rep.-elect Grijalva won a hard-fought race.

Branum alleged the man then elbowed him and told him that he was \"too fat\" to fly.</p><p>\"I had an exciting adventure on my plane flight today,\" the \"No Strings Attached\" actor began his video, which he labeled \"Flying While Fat.\"</p><p>\"Normally when I [have] more money, I'll fly business class because I'm a big guy and I don't want to be in anybody else's space,\" he continued. \"And this time, I got a Comfort Plus ticket.\" According to Delta’s website, Comfort+ seats are the same width as standard economy but provide more legroom.</p><p>Branum said he often worried about flying since he has had \"people freak out at me before.\"</p><p>\"And today, it was a middle seat, not great,\" he said. \"A guy came down, a White man in his sixties.</p><p>\"And first, he freaked out at a woman because she was putting something in the overhead compartment near his seat,\" Branum continued. \"Then he sat down next to me, and he immediately was just p----- off at me and asked me if I could move over.

After Branum told the man, \"You are hardly svelte yourself,\" the man said he was a member of WeightWatchers.\"</p><p>\"And that is how I lost the weight,\" the man told him. </p><p>Branum then asked the man if he expected him to lose weight in the \"next 20 minutes or so.\"</p><p>\"No, have you ever,\" the man said as Branum interjected, \"Do you think I have ever tried to lose weight, Sir?\" </p><p>\"I don't know,\" the man said.</p><p>\"Do you really think that I'm a fat person in this country, and I've never tried to lose weight?\" Branum asked.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" the man repeated. </p><p>\"OK,\" Branum said. </p><p>The video cut to Branum as he addressed the camera, explaining that he told a flight attendant that the man had \"hit\" him but \"I was OK to stay in the seat if necessary.\" </p><p>Branum claimed the man complained to the airline staff that he was \"too fat.\" </p><p>The comedian said multiple Delta staffers came to observe \"if I was too fat,\" including a senior crew member who told the man that Branum would not be removed. Eventually, the man switched seats with a woman across the aisle, and Delta offered her frequent flyer miles for the inconvenience. Branum said he also requested miles.</p><p>Branum noted that the woman who eventually sat next to him was \"so nice.\" However, he went on to say that \"fat people shouldn't be waiting for some future moment when we'll be worthy of traveling and living our lives.\" </p><p>The Emmy Award winner alleged a staff member asked him to delete his video, but he refused.

      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>Former San Jose State University women's volleyball assistant coach Melissa Batie-Smoose has filed a lawsuit against the Board of Trustees of the California State University (CSU) system. SJSU is one of 23 California-based schools that are part of the CSU system. </p><p>Batie-Smoose's contract was not renewed when it expired in February, after being suspended from the team in the middle of the season for filing a Title IX complaint over the program's handling of a transgender athlete on its team and a female player who objected to the trans athlete. </p><p>Now, Batie-Smoose is alleging wrongful termination, claiming she \"suffered and continues to suffer lost wages, loss of professional reputation and opportunity, emotional distress, and other damages.\" </p><p>\"Defendant’s actions were willful, intentional, and/or taken with reckless disregard for Plaintiff’s federally protected rights,\" the lawsuit states. </p><p>\"Other coaches who did not oppose the inclusion of a biological male on the women’s volleyball team or who did not advocate for the rights of female athletes, were not subjected to suspension, termination or any discriminatory actions as was Plaintiff.\" </p><p>A spokesperson from San Jose State University responded to the lawsuit. </p><p>\"We are aware of the filing and have no further comment, due to pending litigation,\" the spokesperson told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Batie-Smoose's Title IX complaint against the school, which she filed at the end of last October, first brought to light allegations that the transgender athlete, Blaire Fleming, conspired with an opposing player to have teammate Brooke Slusser spiked in the face during a game. </p><p>Slusser previously joined a lawsuit against the NCAA and filed another against the Mountain West Conference, citing her experience of being made to share changing spaces and hotel rooms with Fleming without being told Fleming's birth sex. </p><p>Batie-Smoose was then suspended at the start of November, while the allegations against Fleming prompted an investigation by the Mountain West into the situation. </p><p>The Mountain West's investigation determined that sufficient evidence could not be found, however, Fox News Digital later reported that the law firm hired to conduct the investigation, Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher (WFG), is the same firm that is representing the Mountain West against Slusser's lawsuit, which also contain the allegations against Fleming of conspiring to have Slusser harmed, as seen in public records obtained by Fox News Digital.</p><p>Slusser also previously told Fox News Digital that she had a conversation with a teammate who was interviewed as part of WFG's investigation. </p><p>\"Based on what I was told, exactly what one of my teammates had seen go on that night — about talking about the scouting report and leaving the net open — was told to those lawyers. So, that should have been sufficient evidence [of the alleged plan by Fleming],\" Slusser told Fox News Digital, adding she wants to see the investigation reopened. </p><p>\"People are telling you this happened, and it's not second-hand information. She sat there and heard the conversation between Blaire and [former Colorado State volleyball player] Malaya [Jones]. So, to me, just from what I know without even having to dig deep into this investigation, there is sufficient evidence, and they were told sufficient evidence.\"</p><p>Fox News Digital cannot independently verify that Slusser’s teammate corroborated the allegations against Fleming when speaking to investigators. </p><p>WFG later deleted a Nov. 27 online press release from its website that announced the legal victory to keep Fleming eligible. The page is still viewable via an online archive. Fox News Digital has asked WFG multiple times why the page was deleted but has not gotten a response. </p><p>Meanwhile, Batie-Smoose previously told Fox News Digital what she recalled during the Oct. 3 game against Colorado State in which Fleming was accused of conspiring with opposing player Malaya Jones to have Slusser spiked in the face. </p><p>\"Close to the end of that set was when [Fleming] overpassed a serve right on top of the net for Malayla to hit toward Brooke Slusser, and then those two were kind of always doing eye contact and making smirks up to that point. But then, when that happened, they both laughed, and [Fleming] said, ‘Thank you,’ and that's when Blaire blew her a kiss,\" Batie-Smoose alleged.</p><p>Weeks after her contract was not renewed in February, Batie-Smoose's home in Scotts Valley, California, was vandalized in a shooting.</p><p>Scotts Valley Police Department Captain Scott Garner previously told Fox News Digital that officers determined that the weapon used was a pellet gun, and was investigated as an act of vandalism. The pellet had been recovered by police. Nobody was harmed and no suspect or motive was determined. </p><p>Batie-Smoose said she previously received hostile emails about her stance on Fleming and trans inclusion in women's sports. She also claimed to have had in-person altercations with individuals in Santa Cruz and Scotts Valley who disagreed with her stance. </p><p>\"People recognize me in the community and I'm in an area that's speaking out and speaking to fight for women's sports, I'm in an area with some crazies and I definitely believe it was a target on me for speaking out,\" she said.</p><p>Meanwhile, SJSU is under an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for its handling of the situation involving Fleming and Slusser. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is slamming the Biden administration, especially former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, for leaving behind an \"unprecedented backlog\" of critical infrastructure safety improvements across the country. </p><p>A spokesperson for Buttigieg, who is a rumored 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, dismissed the DOT’s criticisms as \"nonsense.\" </p><p>This week, Duffy announced that his  department is obligating four grants, totaling $42 million, to improve safety on Florida’s Brightline high speed railway, which runs from Miami to Orlando. According to the department, the grants were announced and touted under Buttigieg’s leadership, but the Biden administration never actually delivered on obligating those funds. </p><p>The DOT said the Trump administration inherited a backlog of over 3,200 grants that were announced but never obligated by Buttigieg-Biden. The department said that this has \"delayed critical investments in communities across the country.\" </p><p>In Florida, the oldest grant now being obligated by the Trump administration was first announced three years ago in 2022. The department said that \"after much fanfare, their administration failed to do any of the work to actually process and deliver these funds to Brightline or project sponsors in Florida.\" </p><p>DOT said these unfulfilled grants were to help install safety fencing, grade crossing upgrades and a trespassing alert system. The grants included $24.9 million for a trespassing and intrusion mitigation project, $15.4 million for a Broward County sealed corridor project, $1.6 million for a trespassing identification and classification system and a $150,000 grant for Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office to support overtime costs for enforcement of pedestrian trespassing at hot spots. </p><p>\"Under Secretary Duffy’s direction, the Department of Transportation is working diligently to accelerate the distribution of these long-overdue funds and address core infrastructure projects,\" said DOT.</p><p>In the statement, Duffy called the unfulfilled safety grants \"the latest consequence of the unprecedented Biden-Buttigieg backlog.\" </p><p>One of the defining moments of Buttigieg’s tenure as transportation secretary involved a major train wreck that released toxic materials in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023. While Buttigieg was criticized for his handling of the crisis, he placed the blame on the Trump administration for reversing a rail regulation because of a law passed by Congress in 2015.  </p><p>\"Their failure to execute on these rail grants – some of which stretch back years — put Brightline’s three million annual passengers and Florida communities in unnecessary danger,\" said Duffy. \"Under President Trump’s leadership, America is building again. We are delivering critical resources in record time to enhance safety on our railways, roads, and bridges.\"</p><p>In response, Chris Meagher, a spokesman for Buttigieg, dismissed the DOT’s criticisms as \"more of the same nonsense we've heard from them in the past.\" </p><p>\"We invested in more projects than any administration in the past, and more than 22,000 projects were completed during Pete's time in office,\" Meagher told Fox News Digital. </p><p>He said that during Buttigieg’s tenure, the DOT announced more than $390 billion of funding for more than 78,000 projects, more than 22,000 of which were completed, including 445 rail projects, over 200,000 miles of roadway repairs and improvements, over 12,300 projects to build, repair and modernize bridges, and other projects. </p><p>He noted that \"some of those projects take time to get done right.\" </p><p>\"As with any change in Administration, it then becomes the job of the incoming Administration to finish the job, which is nothing new,\" said Meagher. \"What is new is that the current officeholder complains about it instead of just getting the job done.\" </p><p>A spokesperson for the Trump DOT, meanwhile, told Fox News Digital that while Buttigieg and Biden \"talked a big game,\" their backlog \"speaks volumes.\" </p><p>\"They didn’t do the hard work to actually get critical infrastructure dollars out the door. Instead, they spent their time wasting billions on DEI programs and worrying about whether the term cockpit was offensive,\" said the spokesperson.</p><p>\"The contrast here couldn’t be more clear,\" the spokesperson went on. \"In less than a year, Secretary Duffy has moved quickly to get clear the backlog and invest in real infrastructure projects like these rail grants. Brightline riders and Florida communities will be safer because of it.\" </p></body></div></body></html>"

Kirk’s alleged assassin was reported to have had a \"leftist ideology\" and harbored hatred against Kirk specifically.</p><p>The show does not appear to parallel Kirk’s shooting beyond investigating politically motivated attacks, though the trailer for the series seemed to focus on terror attacks carried out by far-right nationalist organizations.</p><p>The trailer’s debut was originally met with backlash from conservative commentators who mocked the show for being politically one-sided.</p><p>\"Can't wait for the new TV show about the liberal deep state woman with a multiracial family that stops right-wing terrorism by monitoring our internet!

      "content": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr blasted Democratic California state Sen. Scott Wiener on Tuesday for calling to break up Sinclair Broadcast Group because it's keeping late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off its ABC stations.</p><p>Carr pointed to Wiener as an example of Democratic lawmakers accusing opponents of stifling free speech while engaging in it themselves. </p><p>\"And there it is. On Kimmel, the Democrats are engaged in nothing more than Projection and Distortion,\" the Trump appointee posted on X in response to Wiener’s post.</p><p>The progressive state lawmaker’s post attacked Sinclair in response to news that the media conglomerate would continue to refuse to broadcast \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" throughout the country for his comments falsely suggesting that Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin is a MAGA supporter.</p><p>Sinclair — which operates dozens of ABC affiliates — made the announcement after Disney reinstated Kimmel’s show this Tuesday after suspending it for several days following his Kirk comments. </p><p>\"Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming. Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show’s potential return,\" the company posted on X on Monday. </p><p>Nexstar Media Group, which owns 32 ABC affiliate stations, also announced on Tuesday that it will continue preempting \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" </p><p>Kimmel’s suspension sparked outrage among liberals, who called it government censorship. Many pointed to the FCC chair’s podcast interview where he suggested the commission could take action if Disney didn't. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was among the voices on the right who were critical of the FCC, comparing it to a mob shakedown.</p><p>When Sinclair refused to return Kimmel to its airwaves, Wiener appeared to threaten the company with government action. </p><p>\"Can’t wait to break Sinclair up. Corporate media consolidation doesn’t jibe with democracy. And although Sinclair isn’t a fan of democracy, most people are,\" he posted on X.</p><p>In a post shared only hours earlier, Wiener accused President Donald Trump \"and his cronies\" of continuing to \"pressure the media to bend to their will.\"</p><p>Carr responded to Wiener’s post Tuesday, saying it was proof liberals are projecting their willingness to use government power on their opponents. He added Democrats distort the issue by blaming Trump rather than Disney for Kimmel’s suspension. </p><p>\"Projection because Democrats are the ones that spent years illegally weaponizing government to silence dissent. And it is Democrats that will do it all again — as they are openly telling you today,\" he wrote.</p><p>\"Distortion because Democrats want to blame anything other than Disney and their local TV stations for Kimmel’s suspension. Those businesses decided that, in their view, a suspension made sense. The reporting on this is clear.\"</p><p>Carr praised Sinclair for standing up to Disney over its decision.</p><p>\"Notably, this is the first time recently that any local TV stations have pushed back on a national programmer like Disney,\" he posted. \"And that is a good thing because we want want empowered local TV stations.  After all, local TV stations — not the national programmers — have public interest obligations, and they should be making decisions that in their view meets the needs of their local communities.\"</p><p>When asked for comment on Carr’s post, Wiener’s reps pointed to Wiener’s reply to Carr on X.</p><p>\"Trump’s unqualified hack FCC chairman: ‘Democrats are the ones silencing free speech &amp; to stop them we need to let mega corporations silence criticism of the right.’ Do you people hear yourselves?? BREAK UP SINCLAIR,\" he stated.</p><p>Sinclair did not reply to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. </p></body></div></body></html>"
