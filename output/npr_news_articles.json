      "description": "A federal shutdown will impact people across the United States. NPR's network of member stations explains how these effects will be felt nationwide.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>As politicians in Washington spar over details of how to fund the government as a shutdown looms, the clock is also ticking for people across the U.S. who would be affected. </p> <p>Without congressional action, government funding will expire at 12:01 a.m. on<strong> </strong>Oct. 1. Anything deemed nonessential would be put on hold, so Americans could experience delays with certain services and hundreds of thousands of federal workers will go without pay. </p> <p>Here are some of the ways a shutdown would be felt across the country. </p>  <p><em>Jump to state-specific impacts.</em></p>  <h2 class=\"edTag\"><strong>If you're flying soon …</strong></h2> <p>Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job, even if that means working without pay while the rest of the federal government shuts down.</p>\n<p>If a shutdown dragged on, travelers could see more \"sick-outs\" of key personnel. That happened during the 2018-2019 government shutdown as workers showed their anger over missing paychecks.</p> <p>Lastly, if you're planning on any international travel in the new year, you may need to build in even more time for passport renewals. U.S. passport agencies will remain open, but it could take longer to process applications with some employees furloughed.</p>  \n<h2 class=\"edTag\"><strong>What about the mail?</strong></h2> <p>The U.S. Postal Service will keep the mail moving as usual in the event of a shutdown. USPS is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.</p>  <h2 class=\"edTag\">Benefit and safety net programs</h2> <p>Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue, but there could be some delay in services, such as processing applications.</p> <p>In a shutdown, the first to feel the pinch could be the mothers and young children who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) food program. </p> <p>\"The timing of this shutdown threat at the start of the fiscal year puts WIC at risk of rapidly running out of funds. A prolonged federal government shutdown of more than one week puts WIC families at risk,\" says Georgia Machell, president and CEO of the National WIC Association.</p>\n<p>Whether WIC could continue under a prolonged shutdown would vary depending on whether states could access other contingency funds.  </p> <p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps) will last longer but could also run out if a shutdown dragged on.</p>  <h2 class=\"edTag\">There could be missed paychecks and lost jobs</h2> <p>Perhaps the biggest impacts will be felt by federal workers and active-duty military service members who will not receive a paycheck during a government shutdown. The White House is also threatening mass layoffs (a reduction in force, or RIF) of federal employees, in addition to furlough notices, if a shutdown happens.</p> <p>A shutdown would happen toward the end of a pay period, so the first full paycheck missed for federal employees would be Oct. 24, while for the military it would be Oct. 15.</p> <p>The only salaries the federal government will continue to pay during a shutdown will be members of Congress and the president, according to the Constitution. However, elected officials can request that their paychecks be deferred while a shutdown is ongoing.</p> <p>Federal employees and military members will get back pay once the shutdown is over.</p>  \n<h2 class=\"edTag\">National parks are a big question mark</h2> <p>During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the Trump administration kept national parks accessible to the public, even as many National Park Service employees had to stay home.</p> <p>At the time, there were reports of damage and trash in the unattended parks. And a Government Accountability Office opinion in September 2019 found that the Trump administration violated federal law when it used entrance fees to keep the parks accessible.</p>  <h2 class=\"edTag\"><strong>The weather forecasts will keep coming</strong></h2> <p>Ahead of past possible shutdowns, the National Weather Service has said it would continue to provide routine forecasts, as well as extreme weather watch and warning information. </p> <p>Many other day-to-day weather operations will also continue uninterrupted, including urgent repairs to radar and other key equipment. But a shutdown could delay routine maintenance, upgrades and long-term projects for less critical services, according to the National Weather Service.</p>\n<p>Previous government shutdowns have delayed the processing of long-term weather and climate data at other federal agencies.</p>  <h2 class=\"edTag\">FEMA will keep working, but funding is running low</h2> <p>Most of employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are considered exempt and will be available for any emergency or disasters. </p> <p>But the main funding source for FEMA, the Disaster Relief Fund, is running dangerously low and needs congressional approval for additional funds. </p> <p>During a shutdown, FEMA would implement immediate needs funding, and this could mean delays in reimbursements to states and local governments. Additionally, FEMA administers the National Flood Insurance Program, which will lapse after Sept. 30 unless there is congressional action.</p>  <h2 class=\"edTag\" id=\"state\">State-specific impacts</h2><h3 class=\"edTag\">Alaska </h3> <p>Alaska has one of the highest percentages of federal employees in its workforce, given its relatively small overall population compared with other states. </p> <p>About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska. President Trump's threat that federal employees could receive termination notices if there is a shutdown increases the uncertainty around how this crucial workforce to Alaska's economy could be affected.  </p> <p><em>For more on the impact in Alaska, head to </em><em>Alaska Public Media</em><em>.</em> </p> <p><em>— </em><em>Liz Ruskin</em><em>, Alaska Public Media</em></p>  <h3 class=\"edTag\">Colorado </h3> <p>Rocky Mountain National Park was the fifth-most visited national park last year. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that Colorado is evaluating its options and would be a \"willing partner if needed to use limited State funds to keep our biggest park fully operational if necessary.\" </p> <p>\"We would certainly ask the Federal government to keep the parks open and staffed, or create avenues for the state to assist in keeping parks open and protected,\" Polis said in a statement. \"If Congress does not fund the federal government, I urge the Administration to prioritize the operations of the national parks that so many people love and are a huge economic driver for our rural communities, especially during leaf peeping season.\"</p>\n<p>The National Weather Service confirmed it will continue to provide forecasts through its forecasting offices in Boulder, Grand Junction and Pueblo.</p> <p>— <em>Caitlyn Kim</em><em> and </em><em>Megan Verlee</em><em>, Colorado Public Radio</em></p>  <h3 class=\"edTag\">California</h3> <p>In response to KQED's questions, the National Park Service (NPS) pointed to its 2024 contingency plan and said a 2025 version is currently in the works, but did not specify whether it would be similar if a shutdown occurred.</p> <p>Emily Thompson, executive director of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks, said it's likely the Trump administration will try to keep all parks open through any 2025 shutdown. That prompted the group to author a letter, signed by 40 former national park superintendents, calling for parks to be closed.</p> <p>\"Leaving national parks open without National Park staff to help protect visitors and resources is not only irresponsible—it's dangerous,\" Thompson wrote in a statement to KQED. \"We don't leave museums open without curators, or airports without air traffic controllers and we should not leave our National Parks open without NPS employees.\"</p> <p>With NPS staffing already down by an estimated 24% at parks, the likelihood of poaching and vandalism would rise even further in the event of an unstaffed shutdown, said Bill Wade, executive director of the Association of National Park Rangers. He points to the destruction of trees at Joshua Tree National Park during the 2019 shutdown. Wade said he's also worried that park staff won't just get furloughed but are also at risk of being fired outright, after Trump directed agencies to prepare for mass firings should the shutdown occur.</p> <p><em>For more on how a government shutdown could impact the Bay Area, </em><em>head to KQED</em>.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Adhiti Bandlamudi</em><em> and </em><em>Sarah Wright</em><em>, KQED</em></p>  <h2 class=\"edTag\">Oregon </h2> <p>There are nearly 30,000 federal workers in Oregon. Each federal agency has its own shutdown plan, but workers can be regarded as fitting into three basic categories:<br/></p>\n<ul class=\"edTag rte2-style-ul\"><li>About a third are not affected because they work for the U.S. Postal Service, the Bonneville Power Administration or other agencies with their own funding mechanisms.</li><li>Another third will be told to stay on the job because they are essential for public safety. That list includes airport screeners, air traffic controllers, border protection workers, federal law enforcement officers, in-hospital medical workers, members of the military, power grid maintenance staff and Veterans Affairs caregivers. They'll be expected to keep working but won't get paid until after funding starts flowing again.</li><li>The last group — also about a third of the local federal workforce — won't work during a shutdown. This group includes part-time workers for agencies like the Forest Service. In previous shutdowns, Congress has paid furloughed workers afterward.</li></ul> <p><em>For more on the impact in Oregon, </em><em>head to OPB</em>.</p> <p><em>— </em><em>Kristian Foden-Vencil</em><em>, OPB</em></p>  <p><em>NPR's Padma Rama and Emily Alfin Johnson edited this piece.</em> </p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

      "description": "With concerns about addiction rising, some advocates and lawmakers call for federal regulations on the gambling industry — but would settle for more state laws to help curb excessive betting.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>It's hard to promote moderation and financial discipline from the bowels of a casino.</p> <p>But that's what Massachusetts state workers try to do every day, amid the clanging bells and flashing lights of the slot machines.</p>\n<p>At the MGM Springfield in western Massachusetts, these workers, wearing green polos, stand outside their small office, right off the casino floor.</p> <p>Above them the sign reads, \"GameSense,\" the state's signature program to curb problem gambling. </p> <p>A mounted screen cycles through messages such as \"Keep sports betting fun. Set a budget and stick to it.\"</p> <p>The workers hand out free luggage tags and travel-size tissues in an effort to get people to stop and chat.</p> <p>If they succeed, they give customers brochures with the state's gambling helpline number and website. They can even enroll them in a program, called Play My Way, that allows customers to set monthly spending limits on how much they gamble.</p>\n<p>Outside the casinos, GameSense is marketed on social media and on sportsbook apps and websites. Meanwhile, the state's Department of Public Health puts its own moderation messages on buses and billboards.</p> <p>\"That's a big movement in 12 years,\" says Mark Vander Linden, who oversees the GameSense program for Massachusetts.</p> <p>Massachusetts' first casino opened in 2015, and as the gaming industry grew, the state developed what it calls a \"responsible gaming\" program, funded by a surtax on gambling industry profits.</p> \n<p>At first, the state regulators tried various strategies to educate customers about the addictive nature of gambling, as well as the financial risks.</p> <p>\"It was much more about making sure that there are brochures that are available that explained the odds of whatever game it was,\" he says.</p> <p>Since then, Massachusetts has put in place additional regulations on a booming industry that now includes widespread sports betting. For example, there's no betting on Massachusetts college teams, and no gambling by credit card. All gambling companies have to allow customers to set voluntary limits and sign up for a \"voluntary self-exclusion list\" that bans them from casinos or sports betting over various time intervals.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">U.S. has no national gambling policy, unlike other countries</h3> <p>Some states have set similar limits in an effort to curb problem gambling, but others have very few. In the absence of a nationwide policy, or a national gambling commission to oversee the industry, each state is on its own.</p>\n<p>Now a growing number of addiction researchers and policy makers say it's time to take bolder — and more unified — steps to combat gambling disorders. They point to the explosion of the gaming industry since 2018, when the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door for states to legalize sports betting and unleashed an aggressive new industry, now legal in 39 states. (Forty-eight states have legalized at least some form of gambling, including lotteries.)</p> <p>Compared to the U.S., several other countries have gone much further in regulating the gambling industry, and some experts in the U.S. are looking to them as potential models.</p> <p>For example, Norway's government has a monopoly on all slot machines so it can control the types of games offered, and every gambler in the country is limited to losing only 20,000 kroner (about $2,000) a month.</p> <p>In the United Kingdom, there's a new 5 pound limit (about $7) on every spin on a slot machine, and gambling companies are now subject to a 1 percent levy that goes into a fund for treatment and prevention of gambling disorders.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, a report published in the medical journal <em>The Lancet</em> called on international health leaders to act quickly on regulations before gambling disorders become widespread and common, and that much harder to stop.</p> <p>But policy leaders point out that the U.S. has less appetite for corporate regulation than many other countries, especially in the Trump administration. At the same time, they warn that doing nothing could pose a serious public health threat, especially now that sports betting apps allow people to gamble anywhere and anytime.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">Fears that more gambling means more addiction </h3> <p>Even before the marriage of online gaming and cellphones, researchers had estimated 1% to 2% of Americans already had a gambling disorder, and another 8%of people were at risk of developing one.</p>\n<p>Some U.S. politicians fear the problem will only get worse.</p> <p>\"The sophistication and complexity of betting has become staggering,\" says Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. \"And that's why we need protections that will enable an individual to say no.\"</p> <p>Blumenthal has co-sponsored the SAFE Bet Act, legislation that would impose federal standards on sports betting companies.</p> <p>The bill proposes a ban on gambling ads during live sporting events, mandatory \"affordability checks\" for high-spending customers, limits on \"VIP\" membership schemes, a ban on AI tracking for marketing, and the creation of a national \"self-exclusion\" database, among other rules.</p> <p>\"States are unable to protect their consumers from the excessive and abusive offers, and sometimes misleading pitches,\" Blumenthal says. \"They simply don't have the resources or the jurisdiction.\"</p> \n<p>The gambling industry is strongly opposed to lobbying against the SAFE Bet Act. Federal standards would be a \"slap in the face\" to state regulators, says Joe Maloney, a spokesperson for the American Gaming Association.</p> <p>\"You have the potential to just dramatically, one, usurp the states' authority and then, two, freeze the industry in place,\" he says.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">'Responsible gaming' is different from a public health approach</h3> <p>New regulations are also unnecessary, Maloney says. The industry acknowledges that gambling is addictive for some people, he says, which is why it developed an outreach/awareness initiative known as \"responsible gaming.\"</p> <p>That includes messages on buses and billboards warning people to stop playing when it's no longer fun and reminding them the odds of winning are very low.</p> <p>\"There's very direct messages, such as – 'you will lose money here,'\" Maloney says.</p> <p>He says his industry group does not collect data on whether those measures reduce addiction rates. But he says gambling restrictions are not the answer.</p> <p>\"If you suddenly start to pick and choose what can be legal or banned, you're driving bettors out of the legal market and into the illegal market,\" Maloney says.</p>\n<p>But public health leaders say the industry's \"responsible gaming\" model just doesn't work.</p> <p>\"You need regulation when the industry has shown an inability and unwillingness to police itself,\" says Harry Levant, director of gambling policy for the Public Health Advocacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston.</p> <p>One reason the industry's approach is \"ethically and scientifically flawed\" is that it puts all the blame and responsibility on individuals with a gambling disorder, Levant says.</p> <p>\"You can't say to a person who is struggling with addiction, 'well just don't do that anymore,'\" Levant says.</p> <p>Levant comes to the issue from personal experience. He is in recovery from a gambling addiction himself. A former lawyer, Levant was convicted in 2015 for stealing clients' money to fund his betting habit. Since then, he has not only become an advocate for stronger regulations, but is a trained addiction therapist.</p> \n<p>The American Gaming Association says it supports treatment for gambling disorder, and helps pay for some referral and treatment services through state taxes. But Levant calls that \"the moral equivalent of Big Tobacco saying, 'Let us do whatever we want for our cigarettes, as long as we pay for chemotherapy and hospice.'\"</p> <p>Instead, Levant advocates for a public health approach that would help prevent addiction from the get-go. That means putting limits on marketing and on the types — and frequency — of gambling — for <em>everyone</em>, not just those already in trouble.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">Can lawmakers stop 'the worst excesses' before the next gambling trend?</h3> <p>To make his case, Levant opens his laptop and pulls up a corporate infomercial produced by SimpleBet, a DraftKings subsidiary<strong>.</strong></p> <p>In the video, the company boasts about getting more people to gamble on sports through what's called micro-betting during live games. \"We drive fan engagement by making every moment of every game a betting opportunity. Automatic, algorithmic, powered by machine learning and AI,\" the voiceover says.</p>\n<p>That's the kind of constant engagement that promotes addiction, Levant says. (Contacted by NPR, DraftKings declined to comment.)</p> \n<p>Some of those gambling mechanisms would be limited by the SAFE Bet Act, which Levant and his colleagues at the Public Health Advocacy Institute helped write.</p> <p>But if the legislation doesn't get through the current regulation-averse Congress, then states need to take strong action on their own, Levant says.</p> <p>The Massachusetts legislature is currently considering the Bettor Health Act, which would impose additional rules on sports betting companies.</p> <p>\"The goal is not to stop gambling entirely,\" says Massachusetts state Rep. Lindsay Sabadosa, a cosponsor of the bill. \"It's to stop the worst excesses of online sports betting.\"</p> <p>The Massachusetts bill includes some components of the federal legislation, such as mandatory \"affordability checks.\" Those would cap how much money some gamblers can lose. Affordability checks are modeled on a pilot program in the United Kingdom.</p> <p>\"If you're only allowed to have two drinks, we know that you're not going to get drunk, right?\" says Sabadosa. \"If you're only allowed to gamble $100 a day because that's an affordable amount, you're not going to go broke. You're still going to be able to pay the rent.\"</p> <p>The Bettor Health Act would also ban \"prop\" bets, which are wagers placed during a live game, like who makes the first shot in basketball, or who hits the first home run in baseball.</p> <p>But state tax revenue from sports betting rose to $2.2 billion in 2023 — a welcome source of funding for struggling state budgets. Because of that, Levant fears that state legislatures will shy away from further regulation.</p> <p>States may even be tempted by the promise of additional revenues from new types of gambling, such as \"i-gaming.\" That refers to online versions of roulette, blackjack and other casino-style games, playable at any hour, from the comfort of your own home.</p>\n<p>I-gaming is currently legal in only seven states, but pending legislation in other states, including Massachusetts, could expand its markets.</p> <p>\"We have empathy for how hard it is for states to balance their budgets in this current political environment,\" Levant says, \"but states are starting to recognize that the answer to that problem is not to further push a known addictive product.\"</p> <p><em>This story comes from NPR's health reporting partnership with</em> New England Public Media <em>and</em> KFF Health News.</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>LVIV, Ukraine — Ukraine's emerging arms industry is on display at an odd place here — an underground parking garage, beneath a gleaming new office building known as Lviv Tech City. </p> <p>Conference organizers chose this secure space so the event couldn't be disrupted by one of Russia's frequent airstrikes.</p> <p>\"We're a Ukrainian company. We're building drones, all different kinds of drones,\" said Maksym Yakovlev, who works with FRDM Group, one of many firms making military drones.</p>\n<p>Many Ukrainian drones cost $1,000 or less and are only used once. They simply fly into a Russian target and explode. The one on display here is a high-end model, the R-34-T. It has six propellers, carries 30 pounds of weaponry, and can be reused. They are sold in pairs, with the equipment to support them, for a little under $70,000.  </p> <p>\"It's a heavy drone which flies in, carries grenades and explosives, drops them on the target, and comes back,\" said Yakovlev. </p> \n<h3 class=\"edTag\">An industry born of necessity</h3> <p>When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine's arsenal consisted largely of aging hardware dating back decades to when Russia and Ukraine were both part of the Soviet Union.</p>\n<p>Ukraine burned through those stockpiles at a furious pace, and then became dependent on U.S. and European weapons.</p>\n<p>President Trump is sounding more supportive of Ukraine following a recent meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the United Nations. </p> <p>But the U.S. president has not restored military assistance, which he halted after assuming office. Trump says NATO countries can buy U.S. weapons and give them to Ukraine. This is now happening on a limited scale, though not at the level the U.S. had been supplying weapons under former President Joe Biden.</p> <p>As a result, Ukraine is ramping up production as rapidly as possible.</p>\n<p>Young Ukrainian tech entrepreneurs like Yaroslav Azhnyuk are leading the charge. </p> <p>\"I lived in Silicon Valley for six years. I went through a very classic startup journey,\" said Azhnyuk.</p> <p>In California, he launched Petcube, a company that makes cameras to keep watch on pets.</p> <p>He brought that expertise back to Ukraine, and now makes cameras for drones.

The energy here is just incredible.\"</p>\n<p>Zelenskyy says the country makes at least 40% of its own weapons overall, and virtually all its own drones.</p> <p>Ukraine had no real drone industry three years ago. It made more than 2 million last year and expects to make at least 4 million this year, according to Ukrainian officials and analysts following the war. </p> <p>The latest models travel hundreds of miles, striking Russian oil refineries and causing significant damage to that country's most important industry.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">A need for more advanced weapons</h3> <p>Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of Ukraine's parliament who heads the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Ukraine had no choice but to build its own weapons.</p> <p>\"We are outnumbered. Russia has more human resources,\" Merezhko said in an interview with NPR. \"That's why we need more sophisticated weaponry to make up for this difference, to fill this gap.\"</p> <p>Ukraine still relies on the U.S. for its most powerful weapons, such as the Patriot air defense system, and F-16 fighter jets. </p> <p>Ukraine hopes it will still be able to work with the U.S. and Europe to receive resupplies as its fires off the missiles needed for those systems. </p> \n<p>But with heavy weaponry as well, Ukraine is looking to build its own.</p> <p>The current buzz centers on the Flamingo, a cruise missile that packs a powerful punch and can travel 1,800 miles, according to the Ukrainians. Ukraine says it is building them now and hopes to be in full-scale production by early next year. </p> <p>Some skeptics say the Flamingo remains unproven and may be overhyped. But if it performs as advertised, Ukraine will have the ability to strike deep inside Russia with a large weapon made at home.</p> <p>\"In terms of military technologies, we are not a burden for NATO, for Europe and for the United States. We are a very good partner, a very promising partner,\" said Merezhko.</p>\n<p>For now, Ukrainian arms makers are still small and in need of investment. But Yaroslav Azhnyuk sees potential.</p> <p>\"There is a big, big financial opportunity for the investors to come here,\" he said. \"Ukraine is the wild east. It's the eastern frontier of the Western civilization.\" </p> <p>He acknowledges that much of the work in the near-term is up to Ukrainians like himself.</p> <p>\"I've been working nonstop on these defense companies. We're seeing these companies making an actual impact,\" he said. \"But I still don't think I'm doing enough. I have to be stronger.

      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>\"When I went to boarding school, I was 7,\" said Ramona Klein, speaking to a group clad in orange shirts at a vigil earlier this month in Washington, D.C. \"My parents didn't see me — other than a little while during the summer — for four years. Some parents didn't see their children for 12 years.\"</p> <p>Klein attended the Fort Totten Indian Industrial School in North Dakota from 1954 to 1958. She said being cut off from her family was just one of the many hardships she faced as a student at a federal Indian boarding school, in addition to abuse and neglect.</p>\n<p>She and many others will be marking Orange Shirt Day at events around the country on Tuesday, in remembrance of the tens of thousands of Native children who attended these schools, the goal of which was to \"kill the Indian … save the man.\"</p> <p>The day of memorial is marked in Canada each year on Sept. 30, where it is formally known as the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, and is increasingly observed in communities in the United States.</p> <p>Klein spoke earlier this month at the vigil at the Indian Gaming Association conference center near Capitol Hill.</p> <p>There, organizers from the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition passed out orange T-shirts that read \"Every Child Matters.\" Klein, a citizen of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, is the group's vice president.</p> <p>From 1819 to 1969, the federal government financed more than 400 Indian boarding schools. Native children were often forcibly removed from their homes and sent to these schools, sometimes hundreds of miles away, where many were abused and neglected.</p> <p>An investigation by the Interior Department found that, of more than 60,000 students who attended the federal Indian boarding schools, at least 973 American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian children died.</p> <p>\"There was physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, academic abuse, intellectual abuse and neglect,\" Klein said. \"If I didn't start healing, it would impact my children and my grandchildren.\"</p>\n<p>The orange shirts honor Phyllis Webstad of the Stswecem'c Xget'tem First Nation, who attended a Canadian boarding school as a child. She now lectures and writes about the experience, including her story of how a bright orange shirt her grandmother had bought for her to wear at her new school was taken away on her first day.</p> <p>For current Indigenous students, honoring Orange Shirt Day is seen as a way of recognizing and correcting how education has been used as a weapon against Native children.</p> <p>\"This was a genocide. We survived, we are resilient,\" said Nani Mahkuk-Guaman, a student leader at the University of Minnesota Morris.

      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Md. — Stephani Cherkaoui has a pot of Moroccan tea on the kitchen stove in her townhome, half an hour outside Washington, D.C. Her kids' artwork — her \"favorite collection\" — adorns the walls. Her cat, Dublin, settles himself on a kitchen chair.</p> <p>Over the past five months, Cherkaoui has had time to sit in this space and reflect on her decision to walk away from her government career. She's one of more than 150,000 federal workers who took the Trump administration's \"Fork in the Road\" buyout offer, resigning with pay and benefits through at least Sept. 30.</p>\n<p>She agreed to share her thoughts and opinions with NPR, emphasizing that she does not speak for the government.</p> <p>Cherkaoui's last day at work was April 18. Since then, she has been getting her paychecks on schedule. Her family has remained on her government health insurance. For the first time in her life, she says, she has been able to just live.</p> <p>\"It's goodness that's coming from a very terribly depressing place,\" she says. \"I'm able to just breathe. It's a new kind of feeling that I've never experienced before. But there's definitely a lot of fear.\"</p> <p>Months of searching for a new job yielded a few interviews but no offers.</p> <p>Back in the spring, President Trump called the government buyout \"a very generous offer.\"</p> <p>Cherkaoui would put it differently.</p> <p>\"I do think it was a fair deal for me — as an individual,\" she says. \"For the American people? No, they got robbed.\"</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">A deal offered to nearly the entire federal workforce</h3> <p>It was just eight days after the presidential inauguration when the Office of Personnel Management sent an email inviting nearly the entire federal workforce, more than 2 million people, to resign. The deferred resignation program, as the Trump administration called it, was modeled on a deal that Elon Musk — who was then leading the Department of Government Efficiency — had fashioned for employees at Twitter. Initially, employees had just over a week to decide whether to accept. Questions abounded over whether the deal was even legal.</p>\n<p>In late March and April, a number of federal agencies reopened the offer. Doubts over the legality of the deal had eased. Uptake was far swifter.</p> <p>Now, with months of paid administrative leave coming to an end, those formally separating from the government are confronting a mix of emotions, including regret, resentment and resignation.</p> <p>Many say they would never have left their posts had they felt staying was an option.</p> \n<p>Scott Kupor, director of the Office of Personnel Management, has spoken about the departures in a positive light.</p> <p>In an interview with the Washington, D.C., news radio station WTOP, he said the team designing the buyout \"did as much as they could to be appropriately generous and give people as long of a runway as they could to go transition into something new.\"</p> <p>Kupor described this moment as an opportunity to usher in a new culture, where everyone in the government is always thinking about how things can be done differently — and better.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">Proud to be doing essential work</h3> <p>Cherkaoui joined the Agriculture Department (USDA) in 2020 after serving as a medic in the Maryland Air National Guard and as a public school teacher, among other roles. As an instructional systems specialist, she managed training for the roughly 9,000 employees of the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, who ensure that the United States' meat, poultry and eggs are safe to eat.</p> <p>\"We send inspectors into all of the meatpacking plants across the country,\" she says. \"They're out here doing a thankless job, every single day.\"</p> <p>The agency's internal training site covered both routine human resources topics and job-specific tasks, such as how to take samples and get them off to a lab.</p> <p>\"People can do what they do because of people like me. We enable that,\" she says.</p> \n<p>Still, from the day Trump was reelected, Cherkaoui felt uneasy. She had heard him rail about waste and bloat in the government. She feared training would be among the first things to go.</p>\n<h3 class=\"edTag\">After passing on the first buyout offer, things changed</h3> <p>Cherkaoui did not take the Trump administration's first buyout offer, in late January. She thought it looked shady.</p> <p>But in the weeks that followed, managers at the USDA sent memos foreshadowing big changes ahead — mass layoffs, relocations and more. Rumors also ran rampant.</p> <p>\"'It might be that we're moving people out. It might be that you could be busted down by two [pay] grades,'\" Cherkaoui recalls hearing.</p> <p>During Trump's first term, some USDA staff members were relocated to Kansas City, Missouri. A move to the middle of the country was a nonstarter for Cherkaoui, given that her entire extended family lives in the Washington, D.C., area.</p> <p>So when she got the email from the USDA offering a second round of buyouts, in April, she took it.</p> <p>\"It was the hardest button click I've ever clicked in my life,\" she says. \"I went back and forth on it for a couple of days, but I knew ultimately that that was going to be the right choice.\"</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">A data analyst in the Midwest regrets leaving</h3> <p>In the Midwest, a data analyst for the Transportation Department was wrestling with the same decision.</p> <p>\"I might have had a minor anxiety attack in the lobby of my building as I was pacing around, considering it,\" says J., who analyzed crash statistics, road quality, bridge quality and other trends for the government. NPR agreed to identify him by only his first initial because he fears professional repercussions for speaking publicly about a past employer.</p> <p>Like Cherkaoui, J. did not consider the buyout when it was first offered in January. But within weeks, Trump's Department of Government Efficiency had terminated the lease for his office as part of its broader downsizing efforts.</p> <p>\"Within the calendar year of 2025, we were going to be out on the street,\" he says. \"I really had no idea how that was going to pan out.\"</p>\n<p>Adding to the uncertainty, Trump issued an executive order outlining a consolidation of some IT-related work. J. worried his job could be moved from the Midwest to Washington, D.C.</p> <p>Given this environment, he had started applying for jobs in the private sector, and by April, he had gotten a couple of offers. So right before the deadline for the second round of buyouts, he accepted the Trump administration's offer, went on paid leave from the government and soon started a new job.</p> <p>In the months since, things have not unfolded as he had expected. His agency's office lease was restored. His old team has not been slated for a move. Looking back, he feels he was forced into an impossible decision, threatened with changes that never came to fruition.</p> <p>Meanwhile, he says, his new job is not nearly as fulfilling as his work for the government. While the pay is roughly the same, he forfeited his good federal government health insurance and other benefits.</p> <p>\"Now that it's been a couple of months, I very much regret my decision,\" he says.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">A newcomer to the government leaves before really getting started</h3> <p>While a large share of the people who accepted the buyout offer were close to retirement, some were just starting their federal careers.</p> <p>Marie had barely gotten through onboarding at the Energy Department when she was faced with the decision over whether to leave. NPR agreed to identify Marie by her middle name only, because she too fears professional repercussions for speaking publicly.</p> \n<p>Marie found herself in a particularly odd situation, having been fired in February as part of the Trump administration's purge of probationary workers — those relatively new to the job — and then temporarily reinstated by court order. Fearing her agency would fire her again at the first opportunity, she opted to resign during the second round of buyouts, giving up on her longtime goal of working on energy policy at the national level.</p>\n<p>The Energy Department did not end up firing its reinstated probationary employees when the court order was lifted, nor did it conduct mass layoffs of other workers, as many had feared. A department spokesperson told NPR that approximately 3,000 employees participated in the deferred resignation program, roughly 20% of its workforce.</p> <p>Marie's search for a new job started slowly, despite her years of experience in the private sector. She believes one factor was the economic uncertainty caused by Trump's tariffs. She worried about stalling out her career. Between her onboarding, her firing and her administrative leave, she had not done any substantial work in almost a year.</p> <p>\"I did some part-time research work over the summer, basically for free, because I just wanted to work and use my brain for things,\" she says.</p> <p>She was still getting her federal paycheck and benefits, for which she was thankful.</p> <p>\"But as a taxpayer, I feel that it's a long time to pay someone not to work,\" she says.</p> <p>Finally, just in the last month, she got not one but three job offers. She accepted a position at a local utility and thinks it could turn into a long career. She hesitates when asked whether she'd ever want to work for the federal government again.</p> <p>\"I don't think it would be something I'd be hurrying back to do,\" she says.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">Hundreds of applications end in \"No, thank you\"</h3> <p>Cherkaoui, the former USDA training specialist, hasn't been so fortunate on the job front.</p> <p>It's not for lack of trying. The market in the Washington, D.C., area is saturated with former feds. The state of Maryland, home to several large federal agencies, lost 15,100 federal jobs between January and August, according to the Maryland Department of Labor.</p> <p>At 40, Cherkaoui has gotten very few interviews, despite her skills and even though she has been applying to jobs nonstop.</p>\n<p>\"Literally hundreds of jobs,\" she says. \"It's just 'No, thank you; no, thank you; no, thank you; no, thank you; no, thank you.'\"</p> \n<p>So, she has launched a consulting business, the Sajai Company, and has landed one contract so far. She's also going back to school to get a doctorate in human and organizational learning. She hasn't abandoned her dream of leading training across the USDA one day.</p> <p>While Cherkaoui is at peace with where she has landed, she's troubled thinking about what others are going through.</p> <p>Since January, the administration has dismantled entire agencies and halted work mandated by Congress. The president and his appointees have fired people whose work involved holding the government accountable — watchdog agency leaders, inspectors general, Justice Department attorneys and people across agencies tasked with protecting civil rights.</p> <p>Just last week, the White House Office of Management and Budget told agencies to prepare for mass layoffs of people working on programs that are \"not consistent with the president's priorities\" in the event of a government shutdown.</p> <p>Cherkaoui understands why government workers may be reluctant to speak out in this moment, though it saddens her deeply.</p> <p>\"I love my country. Being critical of my country — that's showing love. If I didn't love and didn't care, I would let you act like a damn fool,\" she says. \"You have to be able to say something, and if you can't say anything, you're lost.\"</p> <p>Cherkaoui says her former office at the USDA has been disbanded. She estimates that about half of her colleagues left voluntarily, while the rest have scattered to different parts of the agency. These days, she finds herself thinking often of those who remain in government and everything they're enduring.</p> <p>\"It is much more than anything that they've ever had to endure before,\" she says.</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

      "description": "A $7,500 tax credit is available for the lease or purchase of many electric vehicles — but only if contracts are inked by midnight on Sept. 30. The result: The market for EVs is a little distorted.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>The Republican tax and spending package that passed in early July brought an early end to federal EV tax credits, which are worth up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used ones. The credits end on September 30. Specifically, buyers need to have a binding contract in place by that time — the vehicle itself can be delivered later.</p> <p>Anybody who was thinking of getting an EV soon-ish suddenly had a four-figure incentive to get one <em>fast.</em></p>\n<p>The result was pretty predictable: Sales of EVs shot up.</p> <p>\"The past couple of weeks — even in the past several <em>days </em>— EV sales just exploded,\" says Matt Jones, the senior director of industry relations at the auto marketplace TrueCar. \"It's been bonkers.\"</p> <p>Surveys have shown that many Americans were not even aware the EV tax credits existed. But some dealers and carmakers have been trying to raise awareness with ads focusing on the new deadline. For example, if you were shopping for a new Tesla this week, you would have seen a countdown clock on the website ticking away second by second to the last moment on Tuesday that you could place an order and still get the tax credit — if you met all the requirements.</p> <p>The automotive services and tech company Cox Automotive forecasts that EV sales in the third quarter — July, August and September — are up 21.1% from the same period last year, and up 30% from this spring. J.D. Power, another auto data giant, reports that EV sales made up more than 11% of the U.S. market in August — hitting a level \"only achieved once before in December of 2024.\" At that time, buyers were also racing to lock in the tax credits before the Trump presidency began.</p>\n<p>Used EVs are also selling quickly, and Cars Commerce, the company behind Cars.com, reports that vehicles under $25,000 — the ones that are potentially eligible for the used vehicle tax credit — are the fastest-selling EVs on the used market.</p> <p>The bump in EV sales was big enough to boost the entire auto market. According to the auto website Edmunds, this quarter will likely see the strongest Q3 new vehicle sales since before the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020.</p> <p>But there's a flip side, of course.</p>\n<p>\"The end of the tax credit created a rush in September, but it could also trigger an EV hangover in the months ahead,\" writes analyst Ivan Drury of Edmunds.</p> <p>In other words: All those people who raced to buy an EV early? Well, now they <em>won't </em>be buying one later this year. So the EVs that didn't get snapped up before the deadline might have a harder time finding a buyer.</p> <p>Like the rush, the hangover is expected to be temporary. Major automakers are still investing in EVs (partly out of a desire to compete with China), and the appeal of a quiet, low-maintenance vehicle that never needs a fill-up is unaffected by tax policy.</p>\n<p>J.D. Power reports that more than half of new-vehicle shoppers say they're very likely or somewhat likely to consider buying an EV in the next year, and that number has stayed fairly consistent.</p> <p>But without tax credits, EVs may be less appealing to cost-conscious shoppers.</p> <p>The research firm Rhodium Group has estimated that the early end to the tax credits will reduce EV sales by 16 to 38% compared to how sales might have grown — and that's on top of other policy changes, like major changes to emissions rules, that are also expected to slow EV sales.</p> <p>So higher EV sales are probably still coming, but more slowly than expected. How much slower, exactly, no one knows.</p> <p>Automakers will be waiting to see what \"natural demand\" for their electric offerings <em>actually </em>looks like without the incentive of a big tax break.</p> <p>And car shoppers, for their part, will be waiting to see whether automakers can manage to cut prices and keep vehicles competitively priced despite increased pressure from tariffs — and without the largesse of the federal government.</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>October baseball is here a day early, with Major League Baseball's first postseason games scheduled to begin Tuesday afternoon.</p> <p>It's a wide-open field this postseason with no clear favorites like last year's Los Angeles Dodgers. No team in baseball this year won more than 97 games, making the 2025 Milwaukee Brewers the <em>losing-est</em> winningest team in baseball since 2013 (not counting the pandemic-shortened 2020 season).</p>\n<p>That means it's anybody's World Series title to claim — including, potentially, one of three franchises that have never before won the Fall Classic. We've got the coasts: New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Diego, Boston, Philadelphia. And we've got the Midwest: Chicago, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Detroit. We've even got Canada! (Sorry, Southerners.)</p> <p>Still, with 12 teams in the mix, it can be a lot to sort out which to root for. Let us help.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">Do you like rooting for a team that has never been here before? (In other words, are you a human with a heart?)</h3> <p>Of the five teams that have never won a World Series, the Seattle Mariners are the only to have never even <em>reached</em> the Fall Classic. We're talking about fans who have rooted for this team for 49 long seasons, watching as literally every other active franchise has taken a swing at a title. For a particularly bad 20-year stretch that ended in 2022, the M's had the ignominious dishonor of owning the longest postseason drought of any of the big four North American men's professional sports.</p>\n<p>But the mood is suddenly sunny in Seattle, where catcher — and perhaps AL MVP — Cal Raleigh has had a historic year, becoming just the seventh player in baseball history to hit 60 home runs in a single season. Ownership bought big at the trade deadline and in September, the Mariners turned into the second-hottest team in baseball to claim an AL West division title for the first time since 2001.</p> <p>The Mariners' No. 2 seed means a ticket straight to the ALDS. They'll face the winner of the Wild Card Series between the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Guardians, both of which — despite their own long-running title droughts — have at least <em>played in a World Series </em>(and in the last 13 years to boot).</p> \n<h3 class=\"edTag\">Seattle's a no-go, but you otherwise dig that kind of underdog vibe? </h3> <p>Good news. Two other teams in the postseason have <em>also </em>never won the World Series. You can choose between the San Diego Padres, who haven't been back to the World Series since they lost in 1998, or the Milwaukee Brewers, who haven't returned since their last try 43 years ago in 1982. Fans of the Brewers and the Padres have suffered too!</p>\n<p>Both teams have become playoff regulars in recent years but have yet to get over the hump. The Brewers emerged in July and August as baseball's hottest team. At $121 million, they are in the lowest third of payrolls in baseball, dwarfed by big spenders and fellow National League contenders like the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The Padres are bigger spenders, and that money has brought them some of the game's biggest stars, including outfielder Fernando Tatis Jr. and third baseman Manny Machado — but they keep running into their rivals, the Dodgers, in the postseason. (That won't happen this year unless both teams reach the NLCS.)</p>\n<h3 class=\"edTag\">Okay, enough of the underdogs. How about a good, old-fashioned rivalry? </h3> <p>The New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox used to be the most toxic rivalry in baseball. (The Dodgers and Padres have taken that crown for now; last year's poisonous NLDS will be tough to top.) But they have a chance to reclaim their crown when they meet for a best-of-three series in this year's Wild Card round.</p> \n<p>It doesn't matter too much which team you choose. This is your chance to embrace the dark side. The Yankees are the Evil Empire, of course, but don't discount Boston. The Curse of the Bambino is way, way back in the rearview mirror these days, and the Red Sox have won four World Series in the past 21 years, and while yes, we are only talking about baseball, it's worth the reminder that seemingly every other Boston pro sports team has won at least one title since then too. (Honestly, this is making the Yankees seem long-suffering by comparison.)</p>\n<p>The Yankees have a towering lineup, anchored by the otherworldly Aaron Judge who turned in yet another incredible season. His stats: .331 batting average, .457 on-base percentage, 1.144 OPS, plus 53 home runs — something he's now doing with such regularity that it's almost becoming boring. The Red Sox bring a spottier lineup but better pitching, especially in starter Garrett Crochet and closer Aroldis Chapman, who has posted the best ERA of his career in his [checks notes] <em>age 37 season</em>.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\"><strong>Do you love hitting for contact? </strong></h3> <p>Only seven players finished the season with a batting average of .300 or higher — and the Toronto Blue Jays, the AL's top seed, have two of them, shortstop Bo Bichette and designated hitter George Springer. Add in first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (.292) and catcher Alejandro Kirk (.282) and the Blue Jays boast <em>four</em> players hitting .280 or higher. The next-most is just two.</p>\n<p>It's not small ball, exactly, that the Blue Jays play. (Their 77 stolen bases this season was third-lowest in the majors, and most playoff teams hit more sacrifice flies than Toronto.) But the team led the league in batting average, hits and on-base percentage. They were second-to-last in strikeouts. Other teams hit more home runs and scored more runs, but the Blue Jays got men on base a <em>ton</em>. Now that's baseball.</p>\n<h3 class=\"edTag\">Do you just want to root for a winner? </h3> <p>The Philadelphia Phillies could be your team. This team is a powerhouse: slugger Kyle Schwarber (56 home runs), shortstop Trea Turner (.304 batting average), outfielder Harrison Bader (who has hit .305 since joining the Phillies in a trade), first baseman Bryce Harper and outfielder Nick Castellanos (75 and 72 RBIs, respectively). Even though they lost their ace starter Zack Wheeler to injury in August, this is still a great team that can crush anyone on any day.</p> \n<p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, their 2024 World Series rings still fresh from the jeweler, are a good choice too. The Dodgers are dealing with some injuries, including to catcher Will Smith, but what team is 100% healthy? And this top of the order will never not be crazy: Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, all three of them MVPs.</p> <p>Since he returned to the mound in July after elbow surgery, the two-way phenom Ohtani has posted a 2.87 ERA as a pitcher, the second-best of his career. Yet Ohtani had to use his limited appearances this year as a sort of rehab assignment, usually pitching just a few innings, and he only lasted a full six innings for the first time last week.</p> <p>That prompted questions for some about how Ohtani might fit in a postseason strategy. On Monday, his teammate Betts dismissed those concerns.</p> <p>\"I think with him probably being the best player in the world, he can fit in wherever he wants to fit in,\" Betts told reporters. \"Whenever he feels like he needs to go in and pitch, I'm pretty positive nobody with a Dodgers uniform will say no.\"</p>\n<h3 class=\"edTag\">Or do you just want to watch some great young players? </h3> <p>Then tune in to it all. Don't miss the Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal, who is at the peak of his powers and looks destined to win the second Cy Young with his career-best 2.21 ERA. The Chicago Cubs are a likable bunch, with center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong, who's due for a bounceback after cooling off from a hot start in the second half. And the Cincinnati Reds have one of the most electric players in the sport in shortstop Elly de la Cruz, who is making his playoff debut in a Wild Card series against the Dodgers. You can't go wrong.</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>Congress seems to be careening toward a government shutdown, as Democratic and Republican leaders remain at an impasse over funding negotiations and expiring health care subsidies. Lawmakers have less than 24 hours to reach a deal before a midnight deadline.</p> <p>Senate Democrats have refused to back the spending bill in an effort to force Republicans to negotiate on federal health care subsidies. They are pushing for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year in exchange for their support. Democrats also want to repeal cuts to health care programs that were enacted by the GOP's tax and spending bill passed earlier this summer.</p>\n<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., met with President Trump at the White House Monday in hopes of reaching an agreement.</p> <p>But the two parties walked away saying major differences remained. Democrats vowed to continue to push for concessions on health care.</p> <p>Trump went on to taunt Democrats after the meeting. He posted a racist AI generated video on social media. It included mariachi music in the background and an image of Jeffries with a sombrero and a drawn-on mustache. This was accompanied by a vulgar, crudely deep-faked voiceover of Schumer denigrating Democrats.</p> <p>Jeffries dismissed the video in a social media response, saying \"Bigotry will get you nowhere.\"</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Thune accused Democrats of \"hijacking\" the process with a push to address an issue he argued should be dealt with on a separate track. He pointed out that Democrats have voted repeatedly for stopgap bills in the past.</p> <p>The standoff over spending could have major consequences for federal workers and people who rely on government services, particularly as the White House threatens to permanently fire some federal workers deemed non-essential in a shutdown. The move is a dramatic escalation in the increasingly frequent battle over federal spending.</p>\n<p>House Republicans narrowly passed a continuing resolution earlier this month that would fund the government through Nov. 21, but that measure did not win the Democratic support needed to reach a 60-vote threshold in the Senate.</p> <p>The Senate is expected to bring up the House passed bill and the Democrats' alternative bill for votes again Tuesday afternoon, just hours before funding is set to run out. Both again are not expected to get the 60 votes needed to advance.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">No resolution following a meeting at the White House</h3> <p>Congressional leaders met with President Trump and Vice President Vance on Monday afternoon, but left without a deal. After the meeting, Vance accused Democrats of holding government funding hostage.</p> <p>\"I think we're headed to a shutdown because the Democrats won't do the right thing,\" Vance said. \"I hope they change their mind, but we're going to see.\"</p> <p>Schumer, however, said it's on Republicans to negotiate a bipartisan agreement.</p> <p>\"Their bill has not one iota of Democratic input. That is never how we've done this before,\" said Schumer. \"When I was leader, we negotiated four times with Republicans, and we never had a shutdown. And so it's up to the Republicans whether they want a shutdown or not.\"</p> <p>Lawmakers from both party's positions appeared to harden on Monday evening, and most signaled no viable path to averting a shutdown. House Democrats gathered at the Capitol, but Speaker Johnson has not called the chamber back into session for votes, and it's likely to stay out of session as a shutdown starts.</p> <p>Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., told reporters there was still time for some sort of solution, but GOP lawmakers were ignoring a major problem if they insisted on no provisions to deal with increasing costs.</p> <p>\"They must not be talking to the people I'm talking to in Georgia who are hurting and who cannot afford this astronomical hike that we are going to see in their health care premiums. People can't afford that.\"</p>\n<p>Schumer's latest strategy<strong> </strong>comes almost six months after he and several other Senate Democrats voted to advance a GOP stopgap plan that avoided a government shutdown and pushed back the deadline to September. The move infuriated many within the Democratic base and fueled calls for the party to fight harder against Trump's agenda.</p> <p>Republicans argue the stopgap bill allows the committees negotiating the spending bills more time to finish bipartisan spending bills.</p> <p>\"I think it will send a real sense of confidence across the country that we're actually capable of doing the very basics of our job up here,\" Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., told reporters in the capitol on Monday. Rounds says he and other Republicans are open to addressing health care costs. \"Even though none of us were supportive of the ACA to begin with, we can't walk away from the people who have had no place else to go to get their health care coverage.\"</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">What's affected in a shutdown?</h3> <p>While critical services such as Social Security and payments from Medicare and Medicaid, would continue, there could be delays in processing new applications for those programs.</p> <p>In a shutdown, anything deemed nonessential is put on hold, so Americans could experience delays in certain services and hundreds of thousands of federal workers will go without pay.</p> <p>In a move to seemingly raise the stakes, the White House's budget arm issued a memo that instructed federal agencies to prepare to lay off workers permanently, instead of the traditional temporary furlough.</p> <p>Congressional Democrats panned the memo as an intimidation tactic.</p> <p>\"This is nothing less than mafia-style blackmail,\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told NPR. \"Essentially, the president is threatening to fire dedicated federal employees who have nothing to do with the ongoing political and policy dispute.\"</p> <p>If the administration makes good on its threat, it could mean that whenever the federal government does reopen, it would have a smaller workforce.</p>\n<p>Typically, the White House budget office would collect and release agency shutdown plans. This time, each individual agency is responsible for posting and sharing their plans, which has caused a confusing patchwork of information for those seeking to understand the scope of a potential shutdown. However, the White House is saying the Women and Infant Children program, known as WIC, will be among the programs hit quickest in a shutdown. The program provides nutrition assistance and healthcare screenings to mothers and young children.<br/></p> <p><em>NPR's Tamara Keith and Elena Moore contributed to this report.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>SIDOARJO, Indonesia — Rescuers ran oxygen and water to students trapped in the unstable concrete rubble of a collapsed school building in Indonesia, as they desperately worked to free survivors Tuesday a day after the structure fell. At least three students were killed, more than 100 were injured and dozens were presumed buried in the rubble.</p> <p>Rescue workers, police and soldiers digging through the night pulled out eight weak and injured survivors more than eight hours after the collapse at Al Khoziny Islamic Boarding School in the East Java town of Sidoarjo. Rescuers saw additional bodies, indicating the death toll was likely to rise.</p>\n<p>Rescue efforts were temporarily suspended at 10:15 a.m. as the collapsed concrete shook suddenly. People immediately ran for their lives, fearing another collapse, as rescuers urged everyone in the area to avoid the building, including more than a dozens of ambulances that parked near the scene. The work resumed around 1:45 p.m.</p> <p>The students are mostly boys in grades seven to 11, between ages 12 and 18.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">Grieving relatives</h3> <p>Families anxiously awaited news at hospitals or near the collapsed building. A notice posted at the school complex Tuesday morning listed 65 students as missing. National Disaster Management Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari revised the number of people presumed buried in the rubble to 38 by midday.</p> <p>\"Oh my God... my son is still buried, oh my God please help!\" a mother cried hysterically upon seeing her child's name on the board, followed by the cries of other parents whose relatives had suffered a similar fate.</p> <p>\"Please, sir, please find my child immediately,\" cried a father, holding the hand of one of the rescue team members.</p> <p>Heavy slabs of concrete and other rubble and unstable parts of the building hampered search and rescue efforts, said Nanang Sigit, a search and rescue officer who lead the effort. Heavy equipment was available but not being used due to concerns that it could cause further collapse.</p>\n<p>\"We have been running oxygen and water to those still trapped under the debris and keeping them alive while we work hard to get them out,\" Sigit said. He added that rescuers saw several bodies under the rubble but were focused on saving those who were still alive.</p> <p>Several hundred rescuers were involved in the effort and had equipment for breathing, extrication, medical evacuation and other support tools.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">A century-old Islamic boarding school</h3> <p>Islamic boarding schools are commonly called as \"pesantren\" in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation, and its students who are called as \"santri.\" Unlike students in public schools, the santri board in dormitories, because apart from studying formal education, they also study Islamic religious knowledge intensively, and they return home only during school holidays.</p> <p>Government data showed more than 42,400 pesantren listed in 2024 in Indonesia with 3,4 million santris and 370,000 Islamic teachers and preachers.</p> <p>Al Khoziny is named after K.H. Raden Khozin Khoiruddi, an influential figure in East Java, and several prominent Islamic scholars have studied at the school. The community often calls it the Buduran Islamic Boarding School, referring to its location in Buduran village of Sidoarjo district.</p> <p>It's the oldest among 7,300 pesantrens in the province. The first students were recorded as studying in 1920, before the boarding school was officially established in 1927.</p> <p>More than 2,000 santris study at al Khoziny, ranging from junior high school level to college.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">The casualties and injuries</h3> <p>The students had been performing afternoon prayers in a building that was undergoing an unauthorized expansion when it suddenly collapsed on top of them, provincial police spokesperson Jules Abraham Abast said.</p> <p>Residents, teachers and administrators assisted injured students, many with head injuries and broken bones. Female students were praying in another part of the building and managed to escape, survivors said.</p> <p>One male student, a 13-year-old boy, was found dead on Monday and 102 students and teachers were injured and taken to hospitals, some of them in critical condition, Muhari said. By Tuesday, 75 students and two teachers were still hospitalized, he said.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, two male students died from their injuries while being treated in Notopuro General Hospital, the hospital director Atok Irawan said. The two were among 11 students who initially were pulled out alive from the rubble by rescuers, he said.</p> <p>At least one student had to have his arm amputated and two others underwent surgery for head injuries, Irawan said.</p> <p>Authorities were investigating the cause of the collapse. Abast said the old prayer hall was two stories but two more were being added without a permit.</p> <p>\"The old building's foundation was apparently unable to support two floors of concrete and collapsed during the pouring process,\" Abast said.</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",
