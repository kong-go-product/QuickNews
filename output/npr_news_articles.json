      "description": "The U.S. government says Amazon manipulated people into signing up for Prime memberships that were purposefully hard to cancel. The company says its designs and disclosures follow industry standards.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>Amazon and the U.S. government are facing off in a Seattle courtroom over Prime, the company's lucrative subscription service. The government alleges that the company \"tricked\" people into paying for Prime memberships that were purposefully hard to cancel.</p> <p>The lawsuit marks one of the biggest federal cases pursuing one of the world's largest companies. Somewhat unusually for a dense antitrust case, a jury will determine whether Amazon broke the law. Oral arguments are expected to begin on Tuesday in the trial that's slated to last for nearly a month. </p>\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission has accused Amazon of violating consumer-protection and competition laws in how it got people to sign up for Prime, the subscription service that costs $139 a year or $14.99 a month. Amazon denies any wrongdoing.</p> <p>In 2021, the company said more than 200 million people worldwide subscribed to Prime. That was the last time it publicly disclosed membership figures.</p> <p>This Prime case is a prelude to the FTC's second and sweeping lawsuit that has accused Amazon of functioning as a monopoly. Amazon has said that suit is \"wrong on the facts and on the law.\" That trial is slated for early 2027, in front of the same judge, John Chun of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">Government says Amazon knew it trapped people</h3> <p>The FTC alleges that millions of people signed up for Prime unintentionally thanks to Amazon's use of what's known as dark patterns, which the lawsuit describes as \"manipulative design elements that trick users into making decisions they would not otherwise have made.\"</p> <p>One example regulators offered showed a large yellow button \"Get FREE Two-Day Shipping\" as a swift way to sign up without much detail about recurring membership costs, while a small blue hyperlink \"No thanks, I do not want fast, free shipping\" would avoid signing up for Prime.</p> \n<p>And on the other end, the FTC describes a \"four-page, six-click, fifteen-option\" journey to cancel a Prime membership, which it alleges Amazon employees internally called the \"Iliad Flow,\" referring to the epic ancient Greek poem about the long and arduous Trojan war.</p>\n<p>\"Millions of consumers accidentally enrolled in Prime without knowledge or consent,\" the FTC says in its trial brief, \"but Amazon refused to fix this known problem, described internally by employees as an 'unspoken cancer' because clarity adjustments would lead to a drop in subscribers.\"</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">Amazon says it acts like other subscription services</h3> <p>Amazon argues its Prime members are drawn by the program's benefits, not design tricks. It says its designs and disclosures are in line with — or even clearer than — the rest of the subscription industry.</p>\n<p>\"Occasional customer frustrations and mistakes are inevitable — especially for a program as popular as Amazon Prime,\" the company's trial brief says. \"Evidence that a small percentage of customers misunderstood Prime enrollment or cancellation does not prove that Amazon violated the law.\"</p>\n<p>Amazon says the law does not define the term \"dark patterns,\" and the FTC is attempting to apply a broad law against fraud through interpretation. Andrea Matwyshyn, Pennsylvania State University law professor who's advised the FTC in the past, says the law is intentionally broad to give regulators leeway for the latest technology or business practices.</p> <p>\"The question is when design crosses the line into a situation where a reasonable consumer does not have a fair shot of understanding what's going on,\" Matwyshyn says.</p> <p>Amazon is also defending three of its executives who were personally named in the FTC's lawsuit as individuals alongside the company as a whole.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">Judge questions Amazon's legal tactics</h3> <p>In July, Judge Chun formally admonished Amazon lawyers for some of their legal tactics in the lawsuit.</p> <p>The FTC accused Amazon of hiding incriminating evidence by gratuitously marking filings as privileged. After Amazon re-reviewed its privilege logs, the company withdrew almost all of its privilege claims and produced nearly 70,000 documents to the FTC on the eve of the cutoff date for discovery.</p>\n<p>The judge wrote that this conduct was \"tantamount to bad faith\" and appeared motivated by \"the  <br/>desire to gain a tactical advantage.\"</p> <p>Judge Chun has sided with the FTC in several other procedural rulings; he has also denied Amazon's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The FTC's investigation of Amazon began during the first Trump administration. The agency did not file its lawsuit until 2023, however, when it was under the leadership of Lina Khan, the firebrand Biden appointee.</p> <p><em>Amazon is an NPR financial supporter and pays to distribute some of our content.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

      "description": "Many Ukrainian war veterans have physical and mental trauma, and struggle to return to civilian life. Here is a look at some groups trying to help ease them back into the community.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>LVIV and SAMAR, Ukraine — During a CrossFit class, one man slowly, methodically, pulls weights down from a machine. He's in the class, but he isn't fully participating; he's not doing the same exercises as the others, or chatting with them during breaks. Andriy Khrystiuk, 52, only just arrived in Lviv, a big city in western Ukraine, a few days ago. He's a veteran, and trying to recover from wartime mental trauma.</p> <p>Every night Khrystiuk says when he closes his eyes his dreams take him right back to the front lines. \"I often wake up all sweaty because I wake up from combat. In my dreams I still participate,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Khrystiuk was a sniper in northeastern Ukraine's Kupiansk area until he was injured in an attack in May 2024. His right ribs were broken and his right lung was punctured as armor-piercing bullets went in one side and out the other. Bits of the ceramic plate from his ballistic vest were lodged into his chest.</p> \n<p>After a long and difficult recovery process, Khrystiuk tried to go home — alone. He is divorced and his son was killed in the war. \"Nobody waits for me there. It's emptiness,\" he says.</p> <p>Occasionally, despite the dangers, he would drive supplies back to Kupiansk, to the front lines, to feel useful. He felt closer to his comrades on the front than to anyone in the community. He was lonely, and struggling to reintegrate into civilian life.</p> <p>Just over a year after his injury, Khrystiuk is staying at a facility with other recovering veterans in Lviv because, he says, his \"roof was leaking\" — a Ukrainian metaphor for being mentally unstable.</p> \n<p>There are more than a million veterans in Ukraine, according to the Ministry of Veterans Affairs. Many have physical and mental trauma from participating in combat, and Ukrainians are gearing up to tackle the issue of how to support them.</p>\n<h3 class=\"edTag\">Supporting veterans</h3><h3 class=\"edTag\"></h3> <p>Early this year, Khrystiuk received an invitation to join a program called the Lviv Habilitation Center. </p> <p>Though the program is small, people from all over the country who have been traumatized in some way by the war are invited. It serves as a place, after rehab, that veterans can grow used to their new life, come to terms with their trauma and learn new ways to live with their disabilities both mentally and physically. And, as Khrystiuk describes it, \"Emotionally in this place you can take load off your chest a bit.\" </p> \n\n<p>The kitchen is modified to work for people with a range of disabilities including wheelchair users and those using canes. A full-size gym helps people with physical rehab. Regular mental health sessions, and a number of programs including language courses and city outings in Lviv, all aim to help people reintegrate into civilian life.</p> <p>Serhiy Titarenko, a 40-year-old veteran himself, leads the program. When he was discharged from the military in 2018 after an injury left him with no feeling from the chest down. He says he remembers being left on the street outside the hospital in a wheelchair that he didn't know how to use. He wasn't given tools to learn how to build a new life in this condition.</p> \n<p>A psychologist now, Titarenko says there is a concerning rise in veteran suicide, mental health issues and addictive behaviors like drug use and gambling.</p> <p>The habilitation facility can only host 20 veterans at a time, each staying three weeks. But Titarenko is eager to teach veterans what he learned and set up more programs across the country.</p> <p>It's not just veterans who need help adjusting to this new reality in Ukraine. When the habilitation program opened in the residential area where it's located, some area residents asked if the center could cover the gym's floor-to-ceiling windows, \"because they don't want to see disabled people,\" Titarenko says. But he refused, and instead he invited community members in to tour the center and meet the veterans. And he takes the veterans for walks around Lviv to increase interaction and engagement with the community. \"We invited these people, our neighbors — civilians, to our center ... for understanding how they want to talk to us veterans, how they must develop, how they must see,\" Titarenko says.</p> \n<p>Despite Titarenko's efforts on a small scale, many Ukrainian veterans told NPR that they don't feel like civilians understand them and their experiences after returning from the battlefield, and they don't feel comfortable seeking out professional help.</p>\n<h3 class=\"edTag\">Supporting communities</h3> <p>Yuliia Krat is the lead psychologist at East SOS, a Ukrainian NGO that is helping with veteran reintegration. She says she is trying to tackle this divide between the community and veterans with a new training program that she's rolling out in cities and towns in Dnipro region, in central Ukraine.</p> \n<p>The training is directed at community leaders, social workers, civil servants and others who may have frequent interactions with veterans. It starts by explaining, \"what you experience in war leaves its mark, changes a person and their values.\"</p> <p>Krat is doing this in hopes that civilians understand that the return home of millions of veterans is not just a veteran problem, but it's an issue that Ukrainian society must face as a whole. \"My idea is that we as a society need to become commonly responsible for this challenge that we have now. And we cannot just, like, close our eyes and ... leave this responsibility on somebody else,\" Krat says.</p> \n\n<p>That's not the only reason a community-targeted approach can be helpful. Even from his place at the Lviv Habilitation Center, Khrystiuk still worries about veterans who haven't found the kind of support that he did. \"A lot of people are afraid of places like this. They are afraid to move out somewhere,\" he says. \"They choose the 'glass' [starting to drink]. Also there are places that don't have these recovery centers and veteran spaces.\"</p> <p>Veteran Andriy Melnykov, 57, lives in Samar, a city in the Dnipro region. When he was discharged last year, he says, he was depressed and drinking alcohol every day. The first six months were especially difficult. \"I was on the booze and sleep,\" he says. \"I didn't know what to do with myself. Like I had no idea what to do next.\"</p> \n<p>It was his daughter, Arina Melnykov, who snapped him out of it. She's 15 and says that time is too difficult to talk about. Now they're at a community center in Samar with a group of veterans that gets together to play table tennis every week, he's stopped drinking, and he and his daughter regularly go biking together as well.</p>\n<p>The Melnykovs were lucky. Many families, much less a teenager, don't necessarily know how to handle a veteran struggling with returning home to civilian life.</p> \n<p>To Krat this is part of the reason the community-focused approach is so vital. Veterans often struggle to ask for help, and rely on family and community members for support instead. \"And this is why it makes it so difficult to work with them directly because they simply block, they refuse to work with you,\" Krat says. Even training 10 psychologists for every district, she says, wouldn't be productive because many veterans wouldn't go to them. \"That's why we try to give this knowledge to everyone in their surroundings, in their environment, so they can get this help even without knowing it,\" says Krat.</p> <p>Still, the Ukrainians initiating these programs around veterans aren't sure they can meet the amount of need. \"I don't know if it's even possible to be ready for something like this,\" Krat says.</p> <p>But she also won't say it's impossible, and plans to continue building her community training program and spread information about how to support veterans as far as she can.<br/></p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

      "description": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris writes about her brief run for the presidency last year and her relationship with former President Joe Biden in her new book, out on Tuesday.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris' new memoir, <em>107 days,</em> is out Tuesday with a mix of insights and unanswered questions about her historically short run for president after former President Joe Biden dropped out. </p> <p>Harris has largely been out of the public spotlight since losing the election to Donald Trump last November, but the book release kicks off a cross-country tour.</p> <p>Here are five takeaways:</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\"><strong>1. Harris believes she was loyal to the Bidens, but says the feeling wasn't mutual</strong></h3> <p>Loyalty is one of the underlying themes in Harris' book. It's even laid out in one of the introduction quotes before the memoir begins from Kendrick Lamar's \"DNA\": \"I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA.\"</p>\n<p>Harris writes of times that Biden, his family and his senior staff in the West Wing questioned whether Harris truly was loyal, while her own frustrations mounted from the president's staff not speaking up to defend her from outside criticism. </p> <p>In the tumultuous weeks after Biden's disastrous debate performance last summer — when high-profile Democrats began to question his ability to beat Trump — first lady Jill Biden pulled aside Harris' husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, to ask if they were standing by the Bidens. Harris says that irked Emhoff. </p> <p>In another instance, two months into Harris' bid, right as she was about to get on the debate stage, Harris writes that Biden called her. He wished her luck — but then spent time on the call asking if she was bashing him to \"powerbrokers.\"</p> <p>\"I just couldn't understand why he would call me, right now, and make it all about himself,\" she writes.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Biden declined to comment.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\"><strong>2. She doesn't directly say that Biden shouldn't have run for a second term</strong></h3> <p>Harris doesn't make any comment in the book on whether Biden should have run for a second term at all. She defends his mental capacity to serve as president but writes that Biden's staff mismanaged his fatigue and worsened the issue.</p>\n<p>By the time last summer's debate debacle came around, and questions mounted on whether Biden should stay in the race, she says, she was in the \"worst position\" to tell Biden to drop out.</p> <p>\"He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty, even if my only message was: Don't let the other guy win,\" Harris writes.</p>\n<p>She writes that she perhaps should have told Biden in the aftermath of the debate to drop out, but that \"maybe he was right\" to think voters would support him in a second match-up against Trump. In the end, Harris says, it was \"Joe and Jill's decision.\"</p> <p>But Harris acknowledges in the book that it was \"recklessness\" to leave the decision of whether Biden should drop out to the Bidens themselves. \"It should have been more than a personal decision.\"</p> <p>In an interview on MSNBC Monday night, Harris admitted, \"I have and had a certain responsibility that I should have followed through on. … When I talk about the recklessness, as much as anything, I'm talking about myself.\"</p>\n<p>Harris notes that throughout her run, she struggled to distance herself from Biden and his legacy — like when she told ABC's <em>The View</em> that she wouldn't have done anything different than Biden in their years in office.</p> <p>She says at one point, her adviser David Plouffe didn't mince words: \"People hate Joe Biden,\" he said.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\"><strong>3. Her first choice as running mate was Pete Buttigieg</strong></h3> <p>Harris reveals that Pete Buttigieg, her former 2020 political rival who served as transportation secretary in the Biden administration, is a close friend and was her first choice for running mate. She compliments Buttigieg as a savvy communicator and says he would have been an \"ideal partner,\" but she had reservations about whether Americans would accept a ticket with a Black woman married to a Jewish man alongside a gay man.</p>\n<p>Buttigieg responded in a statement to Politico, \"My experience in politics has been that the way that you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you're going to do for their lives, not on categories.\"</p> \n<p>Harris instead chose Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, who Harris says made clear from the start that he had no presidential ambitions. It was a contrast to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, whom Harris is critical of in her book and paints as too ambitious for being a No. 2. She says Shapiro asked one of her staffers about how many rooms the VP's residence had, and on the way in for his final interview, wondered how he could get work from Pennsylvania artists sent to the house.</p> <p>She muses that Shapiro tried to call her to withdraw himself as a contender right before she named Walz because he knew he wouldn't be her choice.</p> <p>Shapiro's spokesperson Manuel Bonder said in a statement, \"it's simply ridiculous to suggest that Governor Shapiro was focused on anything other than defeating Donald Trump. … The conclusion of this process was a deeply personal decision for both him and the Vice President.\"</p>\n<h3 class=\"edTag\"></h3><h3 class=\"edTag\"><strong>4. She is still trying to tell her own backstory</strong></h3> <p>Harris has typically been a buttoned-up politician, especially when it comes to sharing personal anecdotes. In the memoir, though, she's more candid and reveals some of the personal struggles and stresses of her run for president — like the toll it took on her relationship with Emhoff.</p> <p>But in most other parts of the book, it seems Harris is still trying to tell her own story to the public — something the campaign was pressed to do in a short window of time last year after Biden dropped out. After three and a half years of being a vice president that largely left her in the shadows, Harris spent several weeks on the campaign trail trying to reintroduce herself to the country in her own words.</p>\n<p>The book is peppered with familiar stump speech lines from Harris, along with explanations about her decision to become a prosecutor and lessons from her mother.</p> <p>She also recounts her time as vice president meeting with foreign leaders like Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as leading on issues like gun violence prevention from the White House.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\"><strong>5. What's next for Harris is still unanswered</strong></h3> <p>In the last few pages of her book, Harris gives some vague ideas for what she sees as the path forward for Democrats, and for the country.</p>\n<p>\"We need to come up with our own blueprint that sets out our alternative vision for our country,\" Harris writes, adding that \"the heart\" of her vision is investing in educating Gen Z.</p>\n<p>While she touches on the topics of transgender athletes and Israel's war in Gaza in the book, Harris doesn't offer any suggestions for how the party should handle specific issues going forward. Besides noting that she wants to \"be with the people\" and hear their ideas, Harris also doesn't indicate what her own future in politics will look like. She does say that the answer for what's next, though, won't come from Washington.</p> <p>Her book tour, which kicks off Wednesday in New York, will include nearly 20 stops around the country, as well as London and Toronto.</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock wrote in a letter shared exclusively with NPR. The senators say that is the highest rate in the first six months of any year publicly available.</p> <p>\"Whatever our views on border enforcement, immigration enforcement, immigration policy, I think the overwhelming majority of the American people does not want detainees abused while they're in U.S. custody,\" Ossoff told NPR in an interview.</p>\n<p>The Homeland Security Department is rushing to expand detention space and increase the rates of arrests after Congress provided billions of dollars in additional funding. Across the country, reports of overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and issues with food and healthcare access have been the product of a focus to make more arrests. NPR has reached out to DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment.</p>\n<p>The letter follows a report Ossoff released in July that alleges human rights violations occurred at immigration detention centers, including mistreatment of children, citizens and pregnant women. DHS broadly refuted the claims.</p> <p>Earlier this year, ICE officials announced the agency was out of detention space. By the summer, over 50,000 people were in detention but ICE only had 46,000 beds.</p> <p>Since then, ICE has announced expanded detention space through the use of military bases and state partnerships in Indiana, Nebraska, and Louisiana.</p> <p>But the rapid expansion and use of other facilities has drawn criticism from immigration advocates and Democrats.</p> <p>Concern over conditions in detention also comes after DHS cut jobs in the oversight divisions focused on civil rights. This included widespread cuts within the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which conducts oversight of ICE and Customs and Border Protection detention.</p>\n<p>Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons was asked about deaths in custody and delays in reports during a Congressional oversight hearing in May.</p> <p>\"We do conduct a thorough investigation of all of those,\" Lyons said, adding that he would ensure that information on deaths in custody were publicly available online in accordance with Congressional mandates. \"ICE is dedicated to transparency.\"</p> <p>In the letter, Ossoff and Warnock reiterate the concern of delayed reporting of death.</p> <p>\"ICE is failing to meet its own standards for reporting detainee deaths, thereby hindering Congressional oversight efforts and leaving families in the dark as to their loved ones' fates,\" they wrote, adding that ICE guidance requires the agency to post an interim notice of any detainee death to ICE's website \"within 48 hours,\" and directs that \"every effort should be made to post the interim notice\" sooner.</p> <p>Most recently, ICE issued press releases confirming the death of a Mexican national on Aug. 31. The public statement was released two days after his death.<strong> </strong>Another detainee died on Sept. 8, and the release was issued seven days later. Neither is yet on an official ICE detainee death tracker. Another man, who was detained by ICE, died on Thursday in Nassau County, according to local reports.<br/></p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

Instead, the government informed UCLA in generalized form letters that multiple grants from various agencies were being suspended but offered no specific details.</p> <p>In August, UCLA announced that the Trump administration had suspended $584 million in federal grants over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.</p>\n<p>Lin issued a ruling later that month that resulted in $81 million in grants from the National Science Foundation being restored to UCLA. She ruled that those cuts had violated a June preliminary injunction where she ordered the National Science Foundation to restore dozens of grants that it had terminated at the University of California, which operates 10 campuses across the state.</p> <p>The White House did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment on Monday's ruling.</p> <p>The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.</p> <p>Two Ivy League institutions, Columbia and Brown, struck deals to preserve funding that was held up by the Trump administration over similar claims that they had not done enough to respond to campus antisemitism.</p> <p>In the case of Harvard, which pushed back with a lawsuit over cuts to its funding, a federal judge in early September ruled the funding freeze amounted to illegal retaliation for Harvard's rejection of the Trump administration's demands.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration had proposed to settle its investigation into UCLA through a $1 billion payment from the institution. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called it an extortion attempt.</p> <p>UCLA has said that such a large payment would \"devastate\" the institution.</p> <p>Monday's ruling concerns hundreds of medical research grants from the National Institutes of Health that include studies into Parkinson's disease treatment, cancer recovery, cell regeneration in nerves and other areas that campus leaders argue are pivotal for improving the health of Americans.</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

The comments in question from Kimmel: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"</p>\n<p>Carr threatened Disney and ABC affiliates that carry Kimmel's show, encouraging stations to preempt the late night program. Nexstar, which owns stations across the country and needs FCC approval for a multibillion dollar merger with media company TEGNA, quickly pulled the program.</p> <p>\"Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" Disney explained in a statement provided to NPR. The company cited concerns that \"some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"</p> \n<p>After engaging in \"thoughtful conversations with Jimmy,\" Disney stated that they have decided to resume production of the show.</p> <p>Kimmel's suspension sparked widespread outrage. On Monday, hundreds of entertainers, including <em>Hamilton </em>creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and current Marvel and Star Wars star Pedro Pascal — both with long-standing professional ties to Disney — signed an open letter condemning the company's decision. The letter, issued in collaboration with the ACLU, also included signatures from Selena Gomez and Olivia Rodrigo, both of whom found early success as Disney actors.</p> <p>The letter stated in part, \"This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees … Regardless of our political affiliation, or whether we engage in politics or not, we all love our country.

      "description": "President Trump is directing the Justice Department to prosecute his perceived political enemies, upending the career ranks and raising questions about selective prosecution.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>President Trump is openly directing the Justice Department to go after his political adversaries, adding to a sense of unease inside the department about job security and ethical obligations.</p> <p>Even in an era of nonstop social media posts, Trump's weekend update stopped many government attorneys in their tracks. The president said he wanted to see justice served. </p> <p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote.</p> <p>What Trump said couldn't wait are criminal investigations of his most prominent critics: former FBI Director Jim Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff. </p>\n<p>His post emerged only hours after the top federal prosecutor in northern Virginia left his job under pressure. Erik Siebert had worked closely with Trump's top DOJ leaders this year, but he concluded he could not seek criminal charges the president wanted against James.</p> <p>Now Lindsey Halligan, who had been serving as a special assistant to the president, was sworn in Monday as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, though she has no prosecutorial experience. Most recently, she's been helping Trump remove what he calls \"improper ideology\" from the Smithsonian museums.</p> <p>\"This attorney general sent a memo on Day 1 that made it clear that Justice Department lawyers were the president's lawyers, and we are now seeing how that's playing out and how dangerous it is — how it disintegrates the rule of law,\" Stacey Young, a former DOJ attorney who now leads a group called Justice Connection that helps Justice Department workers, said of Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p> <p>Already this year thousands of employees have left the Justice Department through dismissals and forced resignations. Nearly all of the public integrity unit is gone, as are three in four lawyers in the civil rights division. </p> <p>Many people inside the department are afraid, Young said. After all, she said, if the president is willing to fire a prosecutor for not pursuing his enemies, anybody at the department could get fired. </p>\n<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was understandably frustrated with lawmakers and state officials who investigated him.</p> <p>\"The president is fulfilling his promise to restore a Department of Justice that demands accountability, and it is not weaponizing the Department of Justice to demand accountability for those who weaponize the Department of Justice,\" Leavitt said.</p> <p>The Justice Department has traditionally operated with some measure of distance from the White House on criminal investigations. But that distance seems to have closed this year in a way that feels different to longtime observers.</p>\n<p>During the presidency of Richard Nixon, public servants at the DOJ felt squeezed between what the president wanted and what the law required. But even Nixon was not as clear and open as Trump is now about what he wanted to happen.</p> <p>\"In this situation you have a president who is openly, brazenly bragging about his ability to seek retribution against his political enemies,\" said George Washington University law professor Stephen Saltzburg.</p> <p>Saltzburg said it looks as if the Trump White House is insisting career prosecutors use their power to make life hell for people who challenge Trump — and on the other side of the coin, to drop investigations or pardon people who support the president, including the people who rioted at the U.S. Capitol four years ago.</p> <p>Trump's political appointees took an oath to support and defend the Constitution when they arrived on the job. That oath may soon be put to the test, if it hasn't already, Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith wrote recently in his newsletter Executive Functions. </p> <p>\"The Article II truism about presidential power cannot justify continued service to a president and administration openly indifferent to law,\" Goldsmith wrote. \"That is an issue of personal and professional ethics and integrity.\"</p>\n<p>Federal prosecutors decide which defendants to charge, and when and where. But there are still some outside checks on that power. In recent weeks, grand juries in Washington, D.C., have refused to indict people, and magistrate judges have turned away requests for search warrants. </p> <p>That skepticism, which followed the federal occupation of D.C., may carry over into other cases. Take the claims by Trump's critics of selective or vindictive prosecution, for example.</p> <p>In the past, there's been a very high bar to succeed in court on that allegation. But now that Trump is so open about his demands, judges may think differently.</p>\n<p>\"I think the president's announcement of what he wants the Justice Department to do is so out of line with our history of promoting equal justice under law and fairness that I don't think that any federal judge is going to look at this and be happy about what the president is doing,\" Saltzburg said.</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>The Grand Canyon's remote North Rim seems like a world away from its more famous South Rim, only a sliver of the nearly five million people who visit the national park each year make it here.</p> <p>At 8,000 feet above sea level, the North Rim's broad plateaus that drop into the canyon are thickly forested with pine trees. </p> <p>Businesses of any kind are few and far between, making places like the Jacob Lake Inn a sort of beacon in the wilderness. It offers the only fresh cookies for at least 25 miles in any direction, and on a recent bustling Sunday morning visitors lined up at the counter for these famous delicacies. One couple eagerly ordered a chocolate chip and a chocolate parfait, and for good measure, an apple turnover for breakfast.</p>\n<p>But two months ago, it was very different scene at Jacob Lake. Employees, guests and residents were forced to hastily evacuate as a wildfire bore down.</p> <p>Melinda Rich Marshall's great-grandparents opened the inn more than 100 years ago. The business, which also includes a restaurant and a gift shop filled with Native American jewelry and other curios, largely depends on visitors to the national park. Over the years it has seen its share of wildfires.</p> <p>\"In my lifetime, I can think of, like, six that have created economic problems for our family and for Jacob Lake,\" says Rich Marshall.</p> \n<p>Days after they evacuated, a second blaze, the Dragon Bravo Fire, exploded in size, closing the North Rim indefinitely. Rich Marshall says she's had to refund about $350,000 in reservations.</p> <p>\"We don't even know how to imagine what the winter's going to be like because we don't know how we're going to actually make it through financially,\" she says. \"Right now, we're just really trying to be creative just like our ancestors were.\"</p> <p>Scores of local businesses in northern Arizona's national park gateway communities like Jacob Lake have felt the pinch after a particularly damaging wildfire season. More than 200,000 acres burned on the north side of the Grand Canyon alone in July and August. Rich Marshall and others are pressing officials to reopen some North Rim viewpoints in hopes for a return of tourists this fall.</p>\n<p>But the ecological affects of the Dragon Bravo Fire may be less dire than initially feared.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">'Good for forest health'</h3> <p>\"When we came into this, we were expecting to look at devastation,\" says TJ Clifford, who led a crew of federal specialists known as a Burned Area Emergency Response Team. \"So, I was more buoyant as soon as I flew over it and said, 'Okay, we can do this.'\"</p> <p>The BAER Team includes soil specialists, botanists, wildlife biologists and others who assess a wide variety of possible wildfire damage to the national park and adjacent national forest. Clifford says their analysis found that nearly three-quarters of the area inside the Dragon Bravo Fire's perimeter either did not burn or burned at a low severity. And while some stretches do resemble a moonscape with charred vegetation and thick ash coating the ground, he expects most of the area to recover quickly.</p> <p>\"My overall opinion is this was a good tool for forest health,\" he says. \"It's providing the diversity that we need out there. It's also showing that past fuels treatments and past wildfire did a good thing for preventing that devastating impact.\"</p> <p>Fire managers in the West often let lightning-caused wildfires burn under certain conditions for forest health, as they did early on with the Dragon Bravo Fire, which was ignited by lightning on July 4. In social media posts and public statements at the time, the National Park Service said it was using what it called a \"confine and contain strategy.\"</p> <p>But when the weather shifted a week later, historically dry and windy conditions caused the fire to blow up. It destroyed the century-old Grand Canyon Lodge perched on the North Rim along with employee housing and more than 100 park structures. Arizona's elected leaders quickly called for investigations, but some say they are still waiting for answers.</p>\n<p>\"At this point, we have not received any information or any response that makes us think that they're even really fully grasping what occurred and how it occurred,\" says Arizona Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego.</p> <p>In July he and Democratic Senator Mark Kelly wrote a letter to Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum demanding answers about management of the fire. Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona has also requested more information and Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs has called for an independent investigation.</p> <p>\"The administration and the National Park Service really needs to answer what happened so we could potentially stop this from happening in the future,\" says Gallego.</p> \n<p>Since the lodge burned, Park Service officials have said they intended to fully suppress the Dragon Bravo Fire from the start. And even though it is now all but extinguished, fire managers still have not declared it fully contained. In all, it has burned 145,000 acres and has cost nearly $130 million to fight.</p> <p>The Park Service would not agree to an interview for this story.</p> <p>But in an emailed statement, Grand Canyon National Park Public Affairs Officer Joëlle Baird said, \"An interagency review team will be delegated the task to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the fire's management and operational response. These national-level reviews are thorough and can take months to complete.\"</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

      "description": "At issue is whether the president has the authority to dismiss the heads of those agencies that are protected by Congress.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>In an emergency order Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed President Trump to fire Rebecca Slaughter, the last remaining Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission. The court's action is technically temporary, since the justices said they will hear arguments in the case in December, but every indication is that the conservative court majority will use the case to reverse a major Supreme Court precedent that dates back almost a century.</p> <p>Congress created the FTC and lots of other agencies to be multi-member, bipartisan regulatory agencies. And the Supreme Court in 1935 upheld those statutes ruling ruled against then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt's claim that he could fire FTC commissioners at will. In a unanimous opinion at the time, the court said Congress acted within its powers in declaring that a commissioner could only be fired for misconduct — not for a policy disagreement.</p>\n<p>But now, prodded by President Trump, the court's six-member conservative majority seems poised to remake the way independent agencies operate. And if the handwriting on the wall is as clear as it seems to be, the independent agencies won't be independent. Their membership will be subject to the will of the president.</p> <p>The court's action Monday was hardly subtle. While the lower courts had ruled that the president could not fire Slaughter, under the court's 1935 precedent, the conservative Supreme Court majority allowed the president to fire her. Indeed, her name isn't even on the FTC website anymore. And the court so far has allowed Trump to fire other agency board members. In short, the justices are not playing hide-the-ball. And it's a good bet that the court will reverse the 1935 precedent, which until now had been reaffirmed multiple times.</p> <p>The result will be that whereas in the past, these agencies had to be bipartisan, with a minority of opposition party members, now there will be no such requirement. In short, Trump can name all the agency members. And if his successor is a Democrat, he or she can fire all the Republicans.</p> <p>Since  Trump's appointment of three ultra-conservative justices, the Supreme Court's conservative majority has been edging ever closer to reversing the way independent agencies operate. The court's conservatives believe in a so-called unitary executive, meaning that the president <em>is</em> the executive branch, as Chief Justice John Roberts put it in granting Trump significant immunity from prosecution even when he was out of office.</p>\n<p>The only exception to what likely will be a major legal tsunami may be the Federal Reserve Board. In an unsigned order earlier this term, the court so far at least seemed to think that the Fed is different because it was established by Congress 112 years ago to stabilize and modernize the banking industry and to set interest rates. But whether that will hold, is anyone's guess.</p> <p>Dissenting from Monday's order, Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the court's three liberal justices, said that Congress created the FTC and other independent agencies to ensure they would be bipartisan. </p> <p>\"The majority may be raring to change the law passed by congress nearly a century ago,\" she said. \"But our emergency docket, should not be used, as it has been here, to transfer government authority from Congress to the President and thus to reshape the nation's separation of powers.\"</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",

      "description": "Leaves typically start to peak in northern states by early October, but projecting peak foliage isn't an exact science. Here are some things you can do to get the most out of fall's colors.",
      "content": "<html><body><div><div class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\" id=\"storytext\">\n\n<p>It's officially fall in the Northern Hemisphere, which means bright, beautiful foliage isn't far behind.</p> <p>Parts of the U.S. will soon start to see — if they haven't already — leaves and shrubs trade their green hues for vibrant shades of orange, yellow and red as the days get shorter and temperatures get chillier.</p> <p>\"It's a really cool process that we get to watch, that trees are preparing for winter,\" says Alexandra Kosiba, extension assistant professor of forestry at the University of Vermont.</p>\n<p>Trees shed their leaves in order to store and recycle valuable nutrients (in their trunks and branches) before winter's ice and snow can rip them off. As temperatures drop, chlorophyll — the pigment that makes leaves appear green — starts breaking down, revealing the yellows and oranges they've had all along.</p> <p>Leaves typically start to change color in the northernmost states by mid-September, peaking around the end of the month and later farther south.</p> <p>This year, <em>Almanac</em> predicts that leaves in northern areas of the West and Midwest will peak by Oct. 4, while much of New England and the Pacific Northwest will be at or near peak fall color by Oct. 11, followed by the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p> <p>Multiple fall foliage maps — including from Explore Fall, TheSmokyMountains.com and Almanac — do their best to estimate when leaves will change and colors will peak across the country, a helpful resource for leaf-peepers and autumn enthusiasts hoping to make the most of the season.</p> \n<p>But projecting peak foliage isn't an exact science. The timing and onset of the color change vary by location, based on factors like temperature, elevation, rainfall and pests.</p> <p>\"No one can predict fall foliage — we just have to sort of let it unfold,\" Kosiba says. \"We can use research and monitoring to inform what we think is going to happen, but it's really this incredibly unique process that happens, and we get to experience it.\"</p>\n<p>Kosiba says online trackers can be helpful for understanding long-term patterns, though they don't capture local nuances. She recommends that people monitor updates from their state's forest health agency for real-time observations in their area — and prepare to do a little local exploring this fall, even if they're not planning a full-fledged fall road trip.</p> <p>\"If you're in a location … and it's looking a little dull, go a little further afield, go to a different location, and you might find some really good fall foliage developed,\" she says.</p> <h3 class=\"edTag\">Climate change is delaying color change</h3> \n<p>Researchers have found that weather conditions in previous seasons can also affect the timing and intensity of leaf color changes.</p> <p>A tree's recent past can dictate how vibrant or muted its leaves are in the fall. And, in a colorful contradiction, warmer spring temperatures can trigger trees to start the fall foliage process earlier, while warmer fall temperatures can delay the onset of color changes.</p> <p>\"In general, we are seeing fall foliage is occurring later than it has historically, based on global climate change,\" Kosiba says. \"But every year can be really different depending on the spring, summer and fall conditions that occur.\"</p>\n<p>Kosiba says that climate change has delayed fall foliage by about a week since experts started monitoring it in the mid-20th century — around the time that \"leaf-peeping\" entered the modern lexicon.</p> <p>These days, fall foliage-related tourism generates some $8 billion in New England annually, according to the National Park Service, with visitors flocking to towns, mountain ranges and national parks to take in the views.</p> <p>Peak foliage usually lasts seven to 10 days, according to <em>Almanac</em>, though weather conditions can make a big difference. Kosiba says wind and heavy rain can cut a fall foliage season short, while the idyllic combination of warm, sunny days and cool nights can significantly prolong it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"edTag\">Making the most of peak foliage </h3> \n<p>New England is currently experiencing drought conditions — despite a wet spring and early summer — which is causing leaves in some places to turn brown and shrivel up.</p> <p>But in other cases, Kosiba says, minor drought can actually make some leaves turn an even deeper red.</p> <p>Kosiba says parts of New England, like where she is in Vermont, are seeing the onset of fall foliage about a week earlier than expected. But the region's varied topography and rainfall patterns make it hard to paint with a broad brush.</p> <p>\"So we'll see in some places, where the soil is very shallow and rocky, that we are seeing early leaf drop,\" she says. \"And then on the other side of a hill very close to that location, we might see an area that's really green and hasn't even started the fall foliage process.\"</p>\n<p>If you're worried about missing peak Northeast foliage, or planning a last-minute leaf-peeping trip, Kosiba's advice is \"just keep driving south.\" Southern New England and parts of the Mid-Atlantic may not see their colors peak until late October or even November.</p> <p>\"My thought personally, because I love the fall foliage season, is that it's always good somewhere,\" she says. \"So if it seems a little brown where you are, go a little bit to a different location.\"</p> <p>Even if you're staying local, there are a few tricks you can try to get a more colorful view. Kosiba recommends going to a higher elevation, especially if you're in a dry place. Wetlands can be a great place to look for fall foliage, especially for deep reds. And don't forget to look down.</p> <p>\"We often think of fall foliage on trees, but a lot of our shrubs in our forests, even our ferns, turn really nice colors,\" she says, mentioning blueberry shrubs, viburnums and understory plants, a category that includes ferns and mosses. \"There's usually something good to see somewhere.\"</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>",
