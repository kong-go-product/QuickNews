                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Baton Rouge, La</em>. â€” Louisiana is pursuing a criminal case against another out-of-state doctor accused of mailing abortion pills to a patient in the state, court documents filed this month revealed.</p><p>A warrant for the arrest of a California doctor is a rare charge of violating one of the state abortion bans that has taken effect since the U.S. <span class="link">Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade</span> in 2022 and allowed enforcement. </p><p>It represents an additional front in a growing legal battle between liberal and conservative states over prescribing abortion medications via telehealth and mailing them to patients. </p><p><span class="link">Pills are the most common way abortions are accessed in the U.S.</span> and are a major reason that, despite the bans, abortion numbers rose last year, according to a report. </p><p>Louisiana said in a court case filed Sept. 19 that it had issued a warrant for a California-based doctor who it says provided pills to a Louisiana woman in 2023. </p>

<p>Both the woman, Rosalie Markezich, and the state's attorney general are seeking to be part of a lawsuit that seeks to order drug regulators to bar telehealth prescriptions to mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions. </p><p>In court filings, Markezich says her boyfriend at the time used her email address to order drugs from Dr. Remy Coeytaux, a California physician, and sent her $150, which she forwarded to Coeytaux. She said she had no other contact with the doctor. </p><p>She said she did not want to take the pills but felt forced to and said in the filing that "the trauma of my chemical abortion still haunts me" and that it would not have happened if telehealth prescriptions to the drug were off limits. </p><p>The accusation builds on a position taken by anti-abortion groups: that allowing abortion pills to be prescribed by phone or video call and filled by mail opens the door to women being coerced into taking them. </p>

<p>"Rosalie is bravely representing many woman who are victimized by the illegal, immoral, and unethical conduct of these drug dealers," Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement. </p><p>Murrill's office didn't immediately answer questions about what charges Coeytaux faces or when the warrant was issued. But under the state's ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, physicians convicted of providing abortions face up to 15 years in prison and $200,000 in fines. </p><p>Coeytaux is also the target of a lawsuit filed in July in federal court by a Texas man who says the doctor illegally provided his girlfriend with abortion pills. </p><p>Email and a telephone message seeking comment were left for Coeytaux. </p><p>The combination of a Louisiana criminal case and a Texas civil case over abortion pills is also playing out surrounding a New York doctor, Margaret Carpenter. New York authorities are refusing to extradite Carpenter to Louisiana or to enforce Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton the $100,000 civil judgment against her. </p><p>In the Louisiana case, officials said a pregnant minor's mother requested the abortion medication online and directed her daughter to take them. The mother was arrested, pleaded not guilty and was released on bond. </p><p>New York officials cite a law there that seeks to protect medical providers who prescribe abortion medications to patients in states with abortion bans - or where such prescriptions by telehealth violate the law. </p>

<p>New York and California are among the eight states that have shield laws with such provisions, according to a tally by the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. </p><p>The Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine said they "fully expect" California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, to uphold his state's shield law in the new case.  </p><p>Murrill told The Associated Press she will sue governors whose shield laws "purport to protect these individuals from criminal conduct" in Louisiana.  </p><p>The legal filings that revealed the Louisiana charge against Coeytaux are part of an effort for Louisiana, along with Florida and Texas, to join a lawsuit filed last year by the Republican attorneys general for Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to roll back federal approvals for mifepristone. </p><p>This year, both Louisiana and <span class="link">Texas have adopted laws</span> to target out-of-state providers of abortion pills. </p><p>The Louisiana law lets patients who receive abortions sue providers and others. The Texas law goes further and allows anyone to sue those who prescribe such pills in the state. </p><p>Both Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary have said they are <span class="link">conducting a full review of mifepristone's safety and effectiveness</span>.</p>

<p>Asked whether the review could lead to a ban on mifepristone, CBS News medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder suggested it would be difficult for the FDA to withdraw approval, an extraordinary step that would quickly draw legal challenges. But she said depending on what the safety review finds, it could make access more difficult by limiting the drug's availability through telehealth or by mail or by restricting the ability to prescribe it to doctors, rather than physician assistants or nurses who are also currently permitted to prescribe it.</p><p>Medication abortion has been available in the U.S. since 2000, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of mifepristone. </p><p>A group of 19 Democratic state attorneys general on Monday issued a statement saying that mifepristone is safe and expressing concern over an FDA review, which some Republican attorneys general had called for.  </p><p>The Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine reiterated in a statement to The Associated Press that the medication is safe and an "essential part of women's healthcare." </p><p>The nationwide organization, co-founded by Carpenter, described Louisiana's legal actions against Coeytaux as "extreme" and said it is an attempt to "intimidate healthcare providers." </p><p>Murrill described the "unlawful distribution" of the pills in Louisiana as "dangerous," adding that she will use "any legal means available" to hold accountable those who violate the state's abortion laws.</p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>New York â€”Â </em>Prosecutors urged a New York federal judge Tuesday to send Sean "Diddy" Combs to prison for over 11 years following <span class="link">his conviction on prostitution-related charges</span>, citing one of his accusers who said she lives in fear of the music mogul's release from detention.</p><p>"His crimes of conviction are serious and have warranted sentences over ten years in multiple cases for defendants who, like Sean Combs, engaged in violence and put others in fear," they wrote in a presentence submission requesting at least 11 years and three months in prison. </p><p>They filed their sentencing recommendation shortly after midnight, including letters from some of his accusers describing how his violence and demands had impacted their lives. </p><p>Prosecutors called Combs "unrepentant" and said Combs had conceded his acts of violence and abuse throughout his trial but "incredibly ... he now argues that his victims should shoulder the blame."</p><p>Combs, 55, has remained jailed since his July conviction on charges related to arranging male sex workers to travel to hotels or residences where he directed them to have sex with his girlfriends. </p>

<p>The elaborate dayslong, drug-fueled sexual events were often filmed by Combs. Defense attorneys have <span class="link">asked that he be sentenced to no more than 14 months</span> in prison. Sentencing is <span class="link">set for Friday</span>. The music mogul had pleaded not guilty to all of the charges brought against him.  </p><p>In July, Combs was convicted of two charges for violating the Mann Act, which outlaws interstate commerce related to prostitution, for arranging the paid sexual encounters between his girlfriends and male sex workers. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. </p><p>The same jury acquitted the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that could have resulted in a life sentence. </p><p><span class="link">Last week</span>, the defense submitted its presentence arguments, saying Combs has suffered enough during his nearly 13 months behind bars and that he should be freed soon.</p>
<p>They wrote that he became a changed man in a Brooklyn federal lockup, where he has been under constant suicide watch and learned to react calmly rather than violently to threats, even when a fellow inmate confronted him with a shiv. </p>

<p>They said Combs has realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in. </p><p>Prosecutors said Combs was now trying to cast himself as a victim. </p><p>"He is not the victim," they wrote. "The Court should focus on the very real effects that the defendant's conduct had on the lives of the actual victims, his victims." </p><p>At trial, two of Combs' former girlfriends testified that they felt forced to participate in the drug-fueled sex marathons with male sex workers as Combs watched and sometimes filmed.</p><h2>Ex-girlfriends tell court about treatment by Coombs</h2><p>R&amp;B singer Casandra "Cassie" Ventura<span class="link"> described being beaten by Combs</span> when she displeased him during their decadelong relationship. Another ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym "Jane," said she felt pressured to perform sexually with male sex workers. She testified that an enraged Combs once put her in a chokehold and punched her in the face. </p><p>In a letter accompanying the prosecutors' submission, Cassie wrote that she testified while nine months pregnant during Combs' trial "in front of a packed courtroom about the most traumatic and horrifying chapter in my life. I testified that from age nineteen, Sean Combs used violence, threats, substances, and control over my career to trap me in over a decade of abuse." </p><p>Cassie wrote that Combs controlled her like a puppet. </p>

<p>"These events were degrading and disgusting, leaving me with infections, illnesses, and days of physical and emotional exhaustion before he demanded it all again. Sex acts became my full-time job, used as the only way to stay in his good graces," she said. </p><p>Cassie said she still has nightmares and flashbacks on an everyday basis and requires psychological care to cope. </p><p>"My worries that Sean Combs or his associates will come after me and my family is my reality. I have in fact moved my family out of the New York area and am keeping as private and quiet as I possibly can because I am so scared that if he walks free, his first actions will be swift retribution towards me and others who spoke up about his abuse at trial," Cassie said. </p><p>The AP does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has. </p><p>In an indictment, prosecutors asserted that Combs used his fame, wealth and violence to force and manipulate Cassie and Jane, now-ex-girlfriends, into the sexual performances he called "freak-offs" or "hotel nights."</p><p>Judge Arun Subramanian has signaled that he is leaning toward a substantial amount of prison time, twiceÂ <span class="link">refusing to grant bail</span>Â since the jury returned its verdict, citing Combs' history of violence.</p>

<p>Attorney General Pam Bondi signed a memo on Monday directing agents from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and other Justice Department agencies to assist in guarding Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.</p><p>The move by Bondi â€” which she hinted at on Friday â€” came after one detainee was killed and two others were injured in a <span class="link">shooting</span> at an ICE field office in Dallas on Wednesday, the latest shooting or threat targeting an <span class="link">ICE facility</span> or immigration agent in recent months. She cast that attack as the latest act of "extreme political violence."</p><p>In a memo shared on X, Bondi said the FBI, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives should "immediately direct all necessary officers and agents to defend ICE facilities and personnel whenever and wherever they come under attack." She also announced the formation of a temporary "ICE Protection Task Force" that could include federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.</p><p>She singled out Portland and Chicago for operations to protect ICE facilities, and said she's directing federal prosecutors in both cities to seek charges against anybody accused of threatening or assaulting law enforcement. President Trump is also <span class="link">looking to deploy</span>Â <span class="link">hundreds of troops</span>Â to the two cities, drawing vehement opposition from local officials.</p><p>ICE has said attacks on its agents have spiked this year, as the Trump administration uses the agency to dramatically increase arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants. In recent months, ICE operations in <span class="link">Los Angeles</span>, <span class="link">Chicago</span>, <span class="link">New York</span> and elsewhere have drawn tense protests and clashes between agents and demonstrators.</p>

<p>On Friday, Bondi also floated a broader crackdown on "repeated acts of violence and obstruction against federal agents." She directed the Joint Terrorism Task Forces â€” which are regional entities scattered throughout the country thatÂ work withÂ the FBI and with state and local police â€” to look into what she described as "domestic terrorism."</p><p>"The Department of Justice will seek the most serious available charges against all participants in these criminal mobs, including conspiracy offenses, assault offenses, civil disorder offenses, and terrorism offenses," the attorney general wrote Friday.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Trump signed a memo calling for investigations into "political violence and intimidation," led by the Joint Terrorism Task Forces. The White House pointed to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk earlier this month, last year's assassination attempts against Mr. Trump, and an increase in attacks on ICE officers.</p><p>The president also <span class="link">penned an executive order</span> labeling antifa a domestic terrorist organization. The move's legal implications aren't clear. Antifa, short for "anti-fascist," generally refers to a loose collection of largely left-wing activists, not a cohesive organization with a leadership structure. Also, domestic terrorism <span class="link">isn't a chargeable offense</span> under federal law, and the government doesn't have a formal list of domestic terrorist groups, unlike with foreign groups.</p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump offered up a 20-point plan Monday that he cast as a roadmap to end the Israel-Hamas war, a proposal that was backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu â€” though it remains unclear how Hamas will respond.</p><p>The plan â€” which was <span class="link">presented as Netanyahu visited the White House</span> â€” calls for Hamas to return all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and for Israel's military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases. It proposes handing over parts of Gaza to a "technocratic" committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.</p><p>Mr. Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu that his goal is to ensure a "sustainable, long-term peace."Â </p><p>Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.</p><p>Netanyahu said Monday he supports the plan, which "achieves our war aims." He said if Hamas does not accept the offer, "Israel will finish the job by itself."</p>

<p>Hamas has not yet responded to the proposal. Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief met with negotiators from Hamas, who said they would review the proposal "in good faith" and provide a response, a White House official told CBS News.</p><p>Some unanswered questions about the plan still linger, including the exact timing of possible Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and the involvement of different international partners.</p><h2>Israel and Hamas would stop fighting, trade hostages and prisoners</h2><p>The plan calls for an immediate end to fighting if both Israel and Hamas agree to the plan, with Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip immediately withdrawing to an "agreed upon line."</p><p>"During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal," the plan states.</p>

<p>Within 72 hours of Israel accepting the deal, which Netanyahu appeared to do Monday, Hamas is expected to free all remaining hostages. Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.</p><p>In exchange, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, as well as 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the current conflict. The plan calls for the remains of 15 deceased Gazans to be returned for every one deceased hostage. The Israeli releases would take place after the hostages are released by Hamas.</p><p>The plan calls for Gaza to be demilitarized "under the supervision of independent monitors," with any weapons factories and tunnels destroyed and weapons decommissioned.</p><p>"A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people," one of the 20 points states.</p><h2>Aid and economic development would enter Gaza</h2><p>The plan states "full aid will be immediately sent" to Gaza, which has faced <span class="link">severe food shortages</span> and has fallen into famine in some regions, according to the world's leading authority on food crises.Â </p><p>It calls for aid deliveries that are at least equal to the levels agreed upon during a <span class="link">prior two-month ceasefire</span> that began in January, with supplies flowing through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza. It also states the plan would involve "rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries."</p><p>It states aid would be distributed by "international institutions not associated in any manner with either party," including the United Nations and the Red Crescent. The plan does not mention the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a <span class="link">controversial</span> U.S.- and Israeli-backed group that has handled many aid deliveries in the territory in recent months, whose members have been repeatedly accused of firing at Palestinians trying to get aid.</p>

<p>The proposal also floats convening a "panel of experts" that could draw up economic redevelopment plans for the Gaza Strip. It states Gaza would exist in a "special economic zone" with "preferred tariff and access rates."</p><h2>Gaza to be led by "technocratic" group and stabilization force, not Hamas</h2><p>After Israel withdraws from parts of Gaza, the plan calls for the territory to be governed by neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority, which currently oversees much of the West Bank.</p><p>Instead, the enclave would be governed by a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza." It's not clear who would participate in that committee, but the plan states it would be composed of "qualified Palestinians and international experts."</p><p>Overseeing this new governing structure would be a "Board of Peace" chaired by Mr. Trump.</p><p>In a press conference Monday, the president said he's slated to lead the board "not at my request, believe me. I'm very busy. But we have to make sure this works."</p><p>The plan also envisions an "International Stabilization Force" that would temporarily oversee security in Gaza. This group would be backed by the U.S. and Arab states, and tasked with training "vetted Palestinian Police forces" in collaboration with Jordan and Egypt.Â </p><p>It states Hamas would need to "agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form." But Hamas members would get amnesty if they "commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons," and members of the group who want to leave the territory would be able to do so.</p>

<p>The plan would also â€” at least temporarily â€” sideline the Palestinian Authority, which has played a key part in security and governance in the occupied Palestinian territories since the 1990s. The authority is dominated by Fatah, a political movement that has long been at odds with Hamas, and it has not governed Gaza since Hamas took over the strip in 2007.</p><p>Netanyahu has long criticized the Palestinian Authority. He said Monday the group would have "no role whatsoever in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation," including changes to its education system and an end to a long-controversial stipend system for the families of Palestinian militants.</p><p>The West Bank â€” which Israel has occupied since 1967 â€” is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. The Gaza Strip was also occupied in 1967, though Israel withdrew from the territory and removed its settlements in 2005. The territory has been under a tight Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas' 2007 takeover.</p><h2>Israel would withdraw from Gaza and won't annex territory</h2><p>The Israel Defense Forces would immediately withdraw from part of Gaza after a deal is reached. It would continue to withdraw from parts of the territory and hand over control to the new International Stabilization Force "based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization."</p><p>Israeli forces would remain present in a "security perimeter," however, until Gaza "is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat," the plan states. Netanyahu said Monday the IDF would remain in that perimeter "for the foreseeable future."</p><p>If Hamas doesn't accept the proposal, it calls for the plan to "proceed in the terror-free areas" that are handed over from the Israeli military to the new stabilization force.</p><h2>Plan calls statehood an "aspiration of the Palestinian people"</h2><p>The proposal does not lay out a clear roadmap for an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But it says that, if the plan works out, "the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people."</p>

<p>Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, and has castigated U.S. allies like the United Kingdom and France for recognizing a Palestinian state last week at the United Nations General Assembly, calling it an "absurd prize for terrorism." Mr. Trump has also opposed calls for a Palestinian state. But key Arab partners have backed Palestinian statehood and cast it as a necessary component of any long-term resolution.</p><p>The plan also pushes for an "interfaith dialogue process" to "try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis," and a "dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence."</p>

<p>Everyone is now accounted for in the aftermath of a shooting and fire at a Michigan church during Sunday services, authorities said during a press conference Monday. The FBI is investigating the Grand Blanc Township melee as "an act of targeted violence."Â </p><p>About 100 people were inside the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on McClandlish Road around 10:25 a.m. SundayÂ <span class="link">when the shooting happened</span>.</p><p>The suspect, identified as a 40-year-oldÂ <span class="link">Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan</span>, drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church, exited his vehicle and fired "several rounds" of an assault rifle at hundreds of churchgoers, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said.</p><p>"This was an evil act of violence. That's exactly what this was," Renye said.  </p><p>Four victims were killed in the shootings. The shooter is also dead, officials said. Two victims remain in critical condition at an area hospital, and six others were reported to be in stable condition, according to hospital officials. Henry Ford Genesys Hospital said it provided care for some of the victims.</p>

<p>The victims range in age from 6 to 78 years old. Henry Ford officials say that of the eight victims, five were treated for gunshot wounds and three were treated for smoke inhalation.</p><p>Monday's press conference was the final in a series of in-person reports, with local police saying additional updates will come from their social media. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was among those who spoke Monday, alongside FBI Detroit acting special agent in charge Reuben C. Coleman, Genesee County Sheriff Christopher R. Swanson, ATF special agent in charge of the Detroit Field Office James Deir and Michigan State Police Director Col. James F. Grady II.Â </p><p>Deir asked that area residents avoid the area near the church, which has been blocked off, asking for cooperation from the public as investigators continue to comb through the wreckage left by the fire. Over 100 victims and witnesses have been interviewed so far, Coleman said. Numerous special teams from state and federal agencies are working on the case, including a National Response Team from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p><p>In the meantime, the authorities praised the dedication of first responders and law enforcement at the scene, some of whom had only two months experience on the job, along with the immediate response of the church attendees during the incident.Â </p>

<p>"There are noble heroes who do not wear a uniform that went to that church yesterday .... Those heroes from that church did their job," the sheriff said.</p><p><span class="link">Survivor Paul Kirby told "CBS Mornings"</span> it was "the scariest moment of my life, not knowing if my family was OK." Kirby's wife and children were with him, attending a service at the church, when they heard "a loud boom coming from the back wall of the chapel."</p><p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said investigators were looking into how much planning went into the attack and whether any clues about the motive were left behind.</p><p>"From what I understand, based on my conversations with the FBI director, all they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith," she said Monday.Â </p><p>The shooting occurred a day after Russell M. Nelson, the oldest-ever president of the Utah-based faith, died at 101.</p><p>Sanford was an Iraq war veteran who deployed once for several months during 2007 and 2008, according to service records provided to CBS News by the Pentagon. Sanford served in the Marines for four years.Â </p><p>Crews in white coveralls and hard hats searched through what remained of the church on Monday morning. A silver pickup truck with two American flags in the back remained where it had smashed into the front brick wall near a sign that says "visitors welcome."</p>

<p>U.S. officials and state lawmakers <span class="link">shared messages</span> in response to the shooting, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered U.S. and Michigan flags to be lowered to half-staff through Friday to honor and remember the victims.Â </p><p>Grand Blanc Community Schools were closed on Monday.Â </p><p>Bloomfield Township Police says it will "increase patrols around our places of worship and other community gatherings to help ensure a safe environment for everyone."Â </p><p>The shooting was the latest of several attacks on houses of worship in the U.S. over the past 20 years, including one in August that killed two children at the Church of the Annunciation in Minneapolis.</p><p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is leading the investigation, has asked anyone with information to call 1-800-225-5324 or submit a tipÂ here.Â </p>

<p>Hurricane Humberto is likely to bring dangerous surf to most of the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda this week, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said, adding that tropical storm conditions are possible in Bermuda on Tuesday.</p><p>The swells will likely cause "life-threatening surf and rip current conditions," the center warned.</p><p>Humberto rapidly strengthened over the weekend, reachingÂ <span class="link">Category 5</span>Â strength on Saturday before fluctuating back down to a still-powerful Category 4 on Sunday. It had weakened to a Category 3 storm â€” still considered a major hurricane â€” by Monday night.</p><p>The storm is <span class="link">one of two systems</span> swirling over the western Atlantic. The other one strengthened intoÂ <span class="link">Tropical Storm Imelda</span> on Sunday and is forecast to become a hurricane, but move away from the southeastern U.S.</p><h2>Hurricane Humberto forecast and path</h2><p>Humberto's center on Monday was about 265 miles southwest of Bermuda. It was moving north-northwest at about 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph, making it a major Category 3 hurricane, according to the hurricane center.</p>

<p>The center of Humberto is forecast to pass west and then north of Bermuda on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Fluctuations in intensity are possible today [Monday]. Gradual weakening is forecast after that, but Humberto is expected to remain a dangerous major hurricane into Tuesday," the hurricane center said.</p><p>"Swells generated by Humberto will continue to affect portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Bermuda through much of this week," forecasters at the hurricane center warned.</p><p>People along the U.S. East Coast are expected to see the effects of Humberto for the next several days, with the potential for life-threatening surf and rip currents.</p>

<p>Humberto is the eighth named storm of theÂ 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. It came on the heels of <span class="link">Hurricane Gabrielle</span>, which wasn't impacting land as it headed farther out into the Atlantic.</p><h2>Forecasters also tracking Imelda</h2><p>The hurricane center is also closely monitoring a second storm system over the northeast Caribbean in the Atlantic, which strengthened into <span class="link">Tropical Storm Imelda</span> on Sunday and is expected to become a hurricane Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>A hurricane watch is in effect for Bermuda, meaning hurricane conditions are possible, due to the forecasted path of Imelda, the NHC said. Â </p><p>Imelda was expected to bring "significant rainfall" to portions of Cuba and the Bahamas through Thursday, the hurricane center said. It will also likely produce flash and urban flooding, with the possibility of mudslides in higher terrain across eastern Cuba.</p>
<p>There was also a possibility it <span class="link">could interact with Humberto</span> â€” a phenomenon known asÂ <span class="link">the Fujiwhara effect</span>, in which two different storms converge and either join or spin around each other. But CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said such an outcome is not considered likely in this case.</p>

<p>Tropical Storm Imelda is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane on Tuesday morning, but maps show it moving away from the southeastern U.S., according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center.</p><p>Imelda is the ninth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed on Sunday in the western Atlantic.</p><h2>Tropical Storm Imelda forecast maps</h2><p>As of 11 p.m. ET Monday, Imelda was moving away from the Bahamas, according toÂ the hurricane center'sÂ latest advisory. The storm's center was about 140 miles north of Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas and 205 miles east of Cape Canaveral, Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. It was moving north at 8 mph, the hurricane center said.</p>
<p>"A turn toward the northeast is expected later tonight [Monday] followed by a turn toward the east-northeast at a faster forward speed on Tuesday," the NHC said in its latest update, adding that the center of the system "should move away from the northwestern Bahamas" Monday night and "away from the southeastern United States on Tuesday," but would approach Bermuda on Wednesday.</p><p>Rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with up to 4 inches are expected through Tuesday across northeast Florida, coastal South Carolina and coastal sections of southeast North Carolina.</p><p>Swells generated by Tropical Storm Imelda and HurricaneÂ <span class="link">Humberto</span>Â are affecting the Bahamas and will spread to much of the U.S. East Coast early this week, the center added, warning that they're "likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions."</p>
<h2>Tropical storm warnings and watches for Imelda</h2><p>A hurricane watch was issued for Bermuda, the hurricane center said. A tropical storm warning that had been issued for the northwestern Bahamas was canceled Monday night.</p>

<p>A tropical storm watch that had been issued for part of Florida's east coast, from the Palm Beach-Martin County line to the Flagler-Volusia County line, was canceled Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Imelda was expected to drop between 4 and 8 inches of rain across the northwest Bahamas through Tuesday, and 2 to 4 inches across eastern Cuba. State media in Cuba reported that a 60-year-old man died in Santiago de Cuba following landslides there.</p><h2>Imelda follows Hurricane Humberto</h2><p>Imelda came on the heels of <span class="link">Hurricane Humberto</span>, which rapidly intensified to a major hurricane over the Atlantic on Saturday but is not expected to reach land. Humberto reached as high as a Category 5 on Saturday before fluctuating back down to Category 4.</p>
<p>Forecasters said last week there was a small possibility the two systems could interact, creating what isÂ <span class="link">known as a Fujiwhara effect</span>, a rare phenomenon in which two different storms merge and become entangled around a newly formed, common center. However, they said it wasn't considered a likely outcome in this case.</p>

<section class="content__body">
<p>A Mexican marine biologist was seriously injured after he was attacked by a shark while working off Costa Rica's Pacific coast and transferred to a hospital in the country's capital on Monday, authorities said.Â </p><p>Costa Rica's Fire Department said it had rescued 48-year-old Mauricio Hoyos from the attack Saturday and carried him on a 36-hour journey from Cocos Island, around 340 miles off the coast. Despite the serious injuries to his head, face and arms, Hoyos arrived at the hospital in stable condition.</p><p>"He was tagging species for monitoring and when he tagged one of the island's shark species, the shark turned," said Luis FernÃ¡ndez, a physician with the fire department. "It was about 4 meters long with an enormous bite force â€” it turned and bit him on the head."</p><p>Hoyos was leading a scientific expedition as part of the One Ocean Worldwide Coalition, a collaborative initiative that includes the organizations Fins Attached, For the Oceans Foundation, Reserva Tortuga and the Rob Stewart Sharkwater Foundation.</p><p>"Incidents like this are extremely rare," Alex Antoniou, executive director of Fins Attached, said on social media. "Dr. Hoyos is an extraordinary scientist who has dedicated his career to shark conservation, and we are deeply grateful for the support of the Cocos Island community in this very difficult time."</p>

<p>Cocos Island is a Costa Rican national park and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. It is renowned for its great diversity of species, particularly sharks.</p><p>In 2017, an <span class="link">American woman was killed</span> after being mauled by a female tiger shark near the island. Her dive guide was also seriously injured in the attack. Authorities at the time said it was the first attack of its kind near the national park.</p><p>According to Costa Rica's Ministry of Environment and Energy, there are about 14 species of sharks â€” including whale sharks, hammerhead sharks and tiger sharks â€” inhabiting the area, making it a popular spot for divers.</p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A federal judge agreed Monday toÂ temporarily suspendÂ the Trump administration's plan to <span class="link">eliminate hundreds of jobs</span> at the agency that oversees <span class="link">Voice of America</span>, the government-funded broadcaster founded to counter Nazi propaganda during World War II.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., ruled that the U.S. Agency for Global Media cannot implement a reduction in force eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees on Tuesday. Those employees represent the vast majority of its remaining staff.</p><p>Kari Lake, the agency's acting CEO, announced in late August that the job cuts would take effect Tuesday. But the judge's ruling preserves the status quo at the agency until he rules on a plaintiffs' underlying motion to block the reduction in force.</p><p>Lamberth previously ruled that President Trump's administration <span class="link">must restore VOA programming</span> to levels commensurate with its statutory mandate to "serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news." He alsoÂ blocked LakeÂ from removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA's director.</p><p>The judge had also ruled separately that the Trump administration had failed to show how it was complying with his orders to restore VOA's operations.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump signed an executive order in March effectively shutting down the taxpayer-funded broadcaster for what the White House has called "radical propaganda." CBS News reached out to the White House on Monday for comment.</p><h2>Judge cites "concerning disrespect" toward the court</h2><p>Lamberth accused the administration of showing "concerning disrespect" toward the court in response to his earlier orders to produce information about its plans for Voice of America.</p><p>Employees who sued to block the dismantling of VOA claimed the planned cuts would hamper the judge's ability to enforce the injunction he issued in April. "This Court should therefore preserve the status quo while the parties litigate compliance,"Â their attorneys wrote.</p><p>Government lawyers accused the plaintiffs of impermissibly trying to micromanage the agency's operations. "Enjoining the reductions in force would be a wholly overbroad and improper remedy,"Â they wrote.</p>

<p>Lamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1987.</p><h2>Can media agency continue to fulfill its "statutory mission?"</h2><p>The U.S. Agency for Global Media also houses Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba. The networks, which together reach an estimated 427 million people, date to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend U.S. influence and combat authoritarianism.</p><p>The broadcasters have for decades served to project American values around the world while sharing fact-based news in a variety of languages. With Voice of America falling silent, Republican Rep. Young Kim of California told <span class="link">"60 Minutes"</span> earlier this year that she worries the U.S. isÂ <span class="link">ceding the airwaves</span>Â to foreign dictators.</p><p>"When we are in an information war and we stop broadcasting into those repressive governments and into repressive societies â€¦ they are not going to hear the truth," she said at the time.</p><p>Congress appropriated $875 million to the agency for fiscal year 2025 and required that $260 million of the funds must be spent by VOA.</p><p>In March, Trump signed an executive order calling for the agency to reduce its "statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law." A day later, VOA stopped broadcasting for the first time in 83 years. The agency placed almost all of its full-time employees on administrative leave.</p><p>In announcing the job cuts on social media last month, Lake said the agency "will continue to fulfill its statutory mission ... and will likely improve its ability to function."</p>

<p>"I look forward to taking additional steps in the coming months to improve the functioning of a very broken agency and make sure America's voice is heard abroad where it matters most," she wrote.</p><p>Plaintiffs' attorney Georgina Yeomans argued Monday that the cuts would cement the agency's programming at deficient levels that don't comply with the judge's orders. Yeomans said it's unclear who at the agency is making key decisions, such as which jobs to eliminate.</p><p>"We simply do not know," she said.</p>

<p>In its push to hold captured territory in <span class="link">Ukraine</span>, Russia has turned to countries like <span class="link">North Korea</span> for added manpower. Now, it appears <span class="link">additional support</span> is also coming from Cuban mercenaries.</p><p>Videos obtained by CBS News appear to show Cuban nationals captured by Ukraine on the front lines with Russia. Ukrainian officials estimate as many as 20,000 Cubans have been recruited by Russia to fight as mercenaries.</p><p>"Cubans are looking for any way to get out," Florida GOP Rep. Mario Diaz Balart said. "They're recruiting Cubans from around the island with these false promises."</p><p>Ukrainian officials, who shared copies of dozens of passports belonging to Cubans they believe to be mercenaries, say Cubans are being offered one-year contracts with the promise of a $2,000 monthly salary. The average monthly salary in Cuba is about 6,500 Cuban pesos, according to government data, which is equivalent to less than $20. The average age of the mercenaries is 35. Many of those recruited live in poverty and are in desperate need of money.</p><p>One family of a Cuban national who went to fight in Russia told CBS News their loved one has been missing since November, and they haven't received any money.</p>

<p>Orlando Gutierrez Boronat, a Cuban-American activist and a member of the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, a human rights organization dedicated to a free Cuba, traveled to Ukraine last year and spoke to one of the Cuban nationals. Boronat said the prisoner he spoke to was told he would do construction, helping rebuild cities destroyed in the war.</p><p>"When he got to Russia, he found out he and dozens of other Cubans were being assigned roles in the front lines," Boronat said.</p><p>Officials in Ukraine have compiled a list of 39 Cubans who have been killed, but they believe the death toll to be much higher.</p><p>"Currently, we have three Cuban prisoners of war. Two of them have been captured in the last two months," Maryan Zablotskyy, a member of Ukraine's parliament, said.</p>

<p>"We think that, eventually, the number of Cuban troops will hit at least 25,000, becoming the No. 1 contingent of foreign troops in Russia," Zablotskyy said, which would overtake North Korea.<strong>Â </strong></p><p>Diaz Balart said this "absolutely does not happen without the coordination and the approval and the support of the Cuban regime."</p><p>The Cuban government denied any involvement and said it has cracked down on trafficking rings recruiting Cuban nationals.Â </p>

                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>In Dr. Gladys Maestre, South Texas has found a national authority on memory loss. For years, Maestre has studied dementia by going door to door.</p><p>"Everywhere I go, people will pull me and say, 'My mother, my sister, I have a memory problem,'" Maestre said.</p><p>The results of her study, which was conducted through the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley's Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center for Minority Aging Research, astounded her. She found that close to 20% of people over 65 in the Rio Grande Valley have memory loss, versus around 12% on a national level. But she suspects the number is actually much higher â€” potentially up to 40% of the community.</p><p>Maestre is looking at genetic factors, health issues such as diabetes and pollution, and generational issues, including trauma and poverty.  </p><p>The reason why it's happening is unclear, but the impact is unmistakable. </p>

<p>For David and Dawna Johonnett, childhood sweethearts, it was love at first sight. But at 71, Dawna's worsening dementia brought them to Maestre's clinic, where she couldn't recall the shape of a circle.</p><p>When asked if she notices the changes happening, Dawna said, "Yes, I'm me, but I don't know how to say it, but it's not me anymore."</p><p>Texas alone has nearly half a million people with Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, according to the Alzheimer's Association and the Texas Department of State Health Services. State lawmakers this year overwhelmingly approved a $3 billion bill to fund dementia research over the next decade. Voters still have to approve it this fall, and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick hopes they do.</p><p>"I've never had a bigger response than this bill," Patrick said, adding, "It's only getting worse."</p>

<p>Maestre's cutting-edge research includes blood testing for biomarkers. They can identify who's at risk and put those patients on a prevention program.</p><p>For now, David and Dawna Johonnett feel as though they've waded into a darkening drama.</p><p>"How can we make the quality of life that we have now last?"

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who was initially <span class="link">relieved of his duties</span> after being <span class="link">captured on video</span> pushing a woman to the ground outside an immigration court in New York City has been returned to duty, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter told CBS News.</p><p>The officials, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal move that has not been publicly announced, said the ICE officer was placed back on duty after a preliminary review of the incident.</p><p>The move is a striking about-face, just a few days after the Department of Homeland Security released a statement denouncing the officer's conduct as "unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE." Â </p><p>"Our ICE law enforcement are held to the highest professional standards and this officer is being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation," the department said in its statement on Friday. It's unclear where that investigation stands.</p><p>The ICE officer's actions garnered national attention last week, after videos surfaced on social media depicting his confrontation with a visibly upset Ecuadoran woman at the 26 Federal Plaza building, which houses Manhattan's immigration court.</p>

<p>The confrontation appeared to have started when the woman and her daughter tried to cling to her husband, whom federal immigration officers were attempting to take into custody. Officials were captured on video trying to separate the family, and one of the officers was seen grabbing the woman's hair. Footage shows the husband was ultimately detained by federal agents.</p><p>Another video depicts the woman confronting the ICE officer who was initially relieved of his duties. Visibly distraught, she confronts him. "Take me, too," she is heard saying in Spanish. Video appears to show the woman touching the officer with her hands. He tells her not to touch him.</p><p>The officer is then captured on camera pushing the woman to the floor in front of her children and a crowd of journalists and federal and court officials. The ICE officer is heard saying "adios" â€” or goodbye â€” several times during the altercation.</p><p>In a statement shared Monday, ICE identified the woman's husband as Ruben Abelardo Ortiz-Lopez, saying he illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in March 2024. The agency said he came onto ICE's radar after being arrested in June by local authorities for "assault and criminal obstruction of breathing or blood circulation."</p>

<p>ICE said the woman is also in the U.S. unlawfully and faces deportation proceedings.</p><p>Reached for comment, a DHS official did not address the officer being placed back on duty but called the woman's husband a "criminal illegal alien."</p><p>"President Trump and Secretary Noem are not going to allow criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens," the official said. "If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will arrest you and you will never return."</p><p>CBS News reached out to representatives for ICE and the White House for comment.</p><p>Soon after the videos of the altercation emerged, New York Rep. Dan Goldman and New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, both Democrats, urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate the ICE officer and explore "potential prosecution." Goldman accused the ICE officer of "violently" assaulting the woman from Ecuador.</p><p>"Not only should this individual no longer work for the United States government, but the Department of Justice should aggressively enforce the criminal laws against him, consistent with the precedents set by this administration," Goldman said in a statement.</p>

<p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by President Trump, who sued the video-sharing platform and its chief executive for temporarily suspending Mr. Trump's account after the 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, court papers filed Monday show.</p><p>The bulk of the money is slated to go to a <span class="link">planned White House ballroom</span> backed by Mr. Trump.</p><p>The settlement, filed in the U.S. District Court in Northern California, ends a four-year legal battle between the company and Mr. Trump, who has also recently settled with <span class="link">Meta</span> and <span class="link">X</span> after suing the Big Tech firms for similar suspensions. Mr. Trump's accounts on Meta and X were restored in 2022, and his YouTube account was restored in 2023.Â </p><p>In January, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, agreed to <span class="link">pay $25 million</span> to Mr. Trump to settle a 2021 lawsuit <span class="link">over its own suspension</span> of his accounts following the Capitol attack. A month later, X <span class="link">agreed</span> to pay Mr. Trump $10 million to settle its lawsuit, which was filed before billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk bought the platform.Â </p><p>The lawsuit against YouTube argued that the suspension violated Mr. Trump's First Amendment rights because it was allegedly done "in response to coercion of the federal government." Attorneys for the tech firm had called that argument "meritless" in a 2021 court filing, and said forcing the platform to host Mr. Trump without any restrictions "would conflict with YouTube's own First Amendment rights."</p>

<p>In settling the lawsuit, YouTube and its parent company, Google parent Alphabet, agreed to pay $22 million to Mr. Trump, all of which will be directed into the Trust for the National Mall, a fund that is "dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating that National Mall" and "to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom" that Mr. Trump is building.</p><p>Some $2.5 million will go to the other plaintiffs in the case whose accounts were removed from the site, including the American Conservative Union. Â </p><p>Trump attorney John Coale told CBS News, "Glad it's over," noting that the settlements in Mr. Trump's cases against tech companies have added up to around $60 million.</p><p>A representative for Alphabet did not comment on the settlement.</p>

<p>The Trump administration <span class="link">announced</span> in July that a <span class="link">90,000-square-foot ballroom</span> with a seated capacity for 650 people will be constructed in the White House's East Wing.Â </p><p>CBS News <span class="link">reported</span> earlier this month that corporate and individual donors have pledged nearly $200 million to cover construction costs, and fundraising is ongoing. Google, R.J. Reynolds, Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin, Palantir and NextEra Energy have donated, sources told CBS News, and so have firms in the tech, manufacturing, banking and health industries.</p><p>Mr. Trump has cultivated closer ties with tech companies since returning to office. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos attended his inauguration in January, and Musk led his administration's Department of Government Efficiency for months.</p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT,Â announcedÂ new parental controls on Monday aimed at helping protect young people who interact with its generative artificial intelligence program. Â </p><p>All ChatGPT users will have access to the control features from Monday onward, the company said.</p><p>The announcement comes as OpenAI, which technically allows users as young as 13 to sign up, contends with mounting public pressure to prioritize <span class="link">the safety of ChatGPT</span> for teenagers. (OpenAI says on its website that it requires users ages 13 to 18 to obtain parental consent before using ChatGPT.)</p><p>In August, the California-based technology company pledged to implement changes to its flagship product after facingÂ <span class="link">a wrongful death lawsuit</span>Â by parents of a 16-year-old who alleged the chatbot led their son to take his own life.Â </p><p>OpenAI's new controls will allow parents to link their own ChatGPT accounts to the accounts of their teenagers "and customize settings for a safe, age-appropriate experience," OpenAI said in Monday's announcement. Certain types of content are then automatically restricted on a teenager's linked account, including graphic content, viral challenges, "sexual, romantic or violent" role-play, and "extreme beauty ideals," according to the company.</p>

<p>Along with content moderation, parents can opt to receive a notification from OpenAI should their child exhibit potential signs of harming themselves while interacting with ChatGPT.</p><p>"If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation," the company said. "If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out."</p><p>The company also said it is "working on the right process and circumstances in which to reach law enforcement or other emergency services" in emergencies where a teen may be in imminent danger and a parent cannot be reached.</p><p>"We know some teens turn to ChatGPT during hard moments, so we've built a new notification system to help parents know if something may be seriously wrong," OpenAI said.</p>

<p>OpenAI has introduced other measures recently aimed at helping safeguard younger ChatGPT users. The company said earlier this month that chatbot users identified as being under 18 will automatically be directed to a version that is governed by "age-appropriate" content rules.Â </p><p>"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult," the company said at the time.Â </p><p>It noted on Monday, however, that while guardrails help, "they're not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them."</p><p>People can use ChatGPT without creating an account, and parental controls and automatic content limits only work if users are signed in. </p><p>"We will continue to thoughtfully iterate and improve over time," the company said. "We recommend parents talk with their teens about healthy AI use and what that looks like for their family."</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission has started an inquiry into several social media and artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI, about the potential harms to teens and children who use their chatbots as companions.Â </p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
                <html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Although a short U.S.Â <span class="link">government shutdown</span> would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.Â </p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies would be expected to continue showing up on the job â€” without pay â€” even if lawmakers fail this week to strike a <span class="link">deal on federal funding</span>.</p><p>But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.</p><p>"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work," he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.Â </p><p>Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the <span class="link">34-day government shutdown</span> that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.</p>

<p>"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer," Harmon-Marshall said. Â </p><p>Barring a deal in Congress, a shutdown would begin at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown. Â </p><h2>$1 billion hit</h2><p>The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.</p><p>"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations," the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. "It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored."</p>

<p>The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.Â </p><p>Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.</p><p>By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the groupÂ said in a statement last week.</p><p>Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown.Â </p>

                <div class="article-source">CBS News</div>

<section class="content__body">
<p>Video game company Electronic Arts (EA), known as the maker of the "The Sims" and "Madden NFL," is being acquired in a $55 billion deal.</p><p>The California-based company said Monday it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by a consortium of companies that includes Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund PIF; private equity firm Silver Lake, and Miami-based investment firm Affinity Partners, which is led by President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Â </p><p>If finalized, the deal would be the most expensive acquisition of a public company to be taken private in history â€” surpassing $32 billion paid to Texas utility TXU in 2007 to go private.Â </p><p>"The transaction positions EA to accelerate innovation and growth to build the future of entertainment," the company said in a statement.</p><p>As part of the agreement, which is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2027, stockholders will receive $210 per share in cash. Andrew Wilson, who has served as EA's CEO since 2013, will continue to lead the company once the transaction is completed, EA said.</p>

<p>Electronic Arts, which is headquartered in Redwood City, California, oversees a suite of popular video games including "Battlefield," "Apex Legends," "EA SPORTS College Football" and "Need for Speed" among others. In fiscal year 2025, the company posted a net revenue of approximately $7.5 billion.</p><p>The company was founded by former Apple employee Trip Hawkins in 1982. If the transaction closes as anticipated, it will end EA's 36-year history as a publicly traded company.</p><p>The $55 billion acquisition would also be one of the biggest game industry deals to date. The largest was three years ago, whenÂ <span class="link">Microsoft bought</span>Â video game company Activision Blizzard for roughlyÂ $69 billion.</p>
