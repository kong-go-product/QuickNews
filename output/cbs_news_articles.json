Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.</p>\n\n<p>The Bad Boy Records founder was exonerated on more serious racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that would have required a minimum of 15 years in prison and the possibility of a life sentence.</p><p>In their submission, Combs' lawyers argued that a jury sent a loud message to the judge by exonerating him of the most serious charges.</p><p>\"Put simply, the jury has spoken. Its verdict represents an 'affirmative indication of innocence,'\" the lawyers said.</p><p>\"He has served over a year in one of the most notorious jails in America - yet has made the most of that punishment. It is time for Mr. Combs to go home to his family, so he can continue his treatment and try to make the most of the next chapter of his extraordinary life,\" they added.</p>\n\n<p>Prosecutors, who will submit their recommendations prior to the Oct. 3 sentencing, have already said they'll urge Combs stay imprisoned substantially longer than the four to five years they originally thought.</p><p>Defense lawyers, though, wrote in their submission Monday that prosecutors \"have lost all perspective.\"</p><h2>Combs's career and reputation are ruined, lawyers say</h2><p>\"Mr. Combs's career and reputation have been destroyed,\" they wrote. \"His life outside of jail has been systematically dismantled.\"</p><p>Among other things, they noted that he had to let go over 100 employees from his businesses and many of them have been unable to get new jobs because of their past association with Combs.</p><p>His seven children, they said, have faced \"devastating consequences,\" including lost business opportunities in acting, television, fashion and concerts, with some of them being included in some of the nearly 100 civil lawsuits filed against Combs since his arrest.</p><p>The lawyers also noted that Combs and his family were set to star in a Hulu show about their lives, but the show was cancelled once the allegations against him became public.</p><p>Combs was removed from the boards at three charter schools he created in Harlem, the Bronx and Connecticut and was stripped of an honorary doctorate degree from Howard University, which plans to return his prior donations, they said.</p>\n\n<h2>Inmate approached Combs with a shiv, lawyers say</h2><p>Meanwhile, Combs's <span class=\"link\">life in prison</span> has been harrowing at times, even as it has allowed him to become sober for the first time in 25 years, his lawyers said.</p><p>On one occasion, another inmate approached Combs with a shiv, accusing Combs of sitting on a chair that the inmate wanted to sit on, before Combs defused the situation and calmed the man and his makeshift weapon down, the lawyers said.</p><p>They said he has been under constant suicide watch, meaning every two hours he must present his identification card to guards to show he is alive and well and is awakened from sleep in a brightly lighted cell by a guard to ensure he is well.</p><p>He also has limited access to clean water, leaving him to heat the water that he drinks to ensure it won't make him sick and he must sleep within two feet of other inmates in a dorm-style room containing a bathroom and no door, the lawyers wrote.</p><p>\"Mr. Combs has not breathed fresh air in nearly 13 months, or felt sunlight on his skin, often walking with a limp due to a painful knee injury that requires surgery,\" they said. And the food, they added, sometimes contains maggots.</p><h2>Lawyers say Combs had no choice to face trial after plea offer</h2><p>Prior to trial, the lawyers said, prosecutors offered Combs a plea deal that would have recommended a prison sentence of at least 25 years and required him to plead guilty to crimes of which he was acquitted.</p><p>They portrayed their client as a changed man, who had realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in.</p>\n\n<p>\"Without minimizing Mr. Combs's conduct, this is in many ways a 'sex, drugs, and rock n' roll' story,\" they said. \"Mr. Combs had severe substance abuse problems throughout the entirety of the offense conduct and participated in a high-octane celebrity lifestyle.\"</p><p>The music maven's trial featured lengthy testimony from two former girlfriends of Combs who said they felt forced to participate in drug-fueled sex marathons with male sex workers as Combs watched and sometimes filmed the dayslong encounters.</p><p>R&amp;B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura testified that she participated in hundreds of the meetups that were referred to as \"freak-offs\" while she was his most frequent girlfriend from 2007 to 2018.</p><p>Another ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" said she also felt pressured to perform sexually with male sex workers while she dated Combs from 2021 until his arrest at a New York hotel a year ago.</p><h2>Lawyers say a sober Combs looks to new future unlike his past</h2><p>There was also extensive testimony during the trial about Combs beating his girlfriends and using violence and the fears of it to control those around him.</p><p>Defense lawyers at trial conceded there was domestic abuse but said the charges brought by prosecutors were not proven.</p><p>While he was once so depressed in jail that \"there were days when he was unable to get out of his bed or even talk to the psychology department,\" his lawyers said he looks forward to the future.</p>\n\n<p>They said he has begun teaching other inmates essential skills in business management, entrepreneurship and personal development.</p><p>The lawyers wrote that the education program has become \"one of the most impactful and important endeavors of his life\" and he hopes to expand it to state-run facilities once he is released.</p><p>\"He is a humbled man who understands that the most important things in life are his devotion to and quality time with his family and his contributions for the benefit of others,\" they said.</p><h2>Possibility of a pardon</h2><p>Combs' lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, <span class=\"link\">told CBS News in July</span> that he has not had any conversations with the Trump administration about seeking a pardon for his client after another attorney for Combs, Nicole Westmoreland, told CNN it was her understanding that the defense team \"had conversations in reference to a pardon.\" </p><p>But Agnifilo told CBS News, \"I have nothing to do with a possible pardon.\"</p><p>\"I have had conversations with nobody,\" Agnifilo said. \"I have not spoken to the president. I have not spoken to anybody who speaks to the president about Sean Combs. I have not.\"</p><p>He says he hasn't discussed it with Combs either, except to tell him what's in the news.</p>\n\n<p>\"He says, 'Go tell him (Mr. Trump) that I need a pardon,'\" Agnofilo said. \"'Go tell him I deserve a pardon.'

      "image_url": "",
      "content": "<html><body><div><section class=\"content__body\">\n<p><em>Cairo —</em> Archaeologists say they have discovered evidence of an ancient, long-submerged Mediterranean port that was linked to the <span class=\"link\">Taposiris Magna Temple</span> near Egypt's northern coastal city of Alexandria. The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced the discovery last week, expanding on what's known about the temple complex about 30 miles west of Alexandria that dates to the Ptolemaic period, more than 2,000 years ago.</p><p>The Egyptian-Dominican archaeological mission, led by Dr. Kathleen Martinez from the Universidad Nacional Pedro Henriquez Ureña, along with Dr. Robert Ballard, who located the Titanic shipwreck in 1985, has been conducting geological and archaeological surveys of the coastal area surrounding the temple.</p><p>Working in collaboration with Dr. Larry Mayer, from the University of New Hampshire, and the Egyptian Navy Hydrographic Department (ENHD) and the Egyptian Department of Underwater Antiquities, it was this team that uncovered the evidence of an ancient submerged port.</p>\n<p>Martinez told CBS News that after mapping the seabed with state-of-the-art sonar technologies, and then using software to simulate pre-submersion conditions, the team revealed a submerged ancient shoreline about 2.5 miles from the present coast, including a site with an old inner harbor that would have been protected by coral reefs.</p><p>Their research also revealed an extension of a tunnel linking the temple, the remains of which are about half of a mile from the current coastline, to the old port. The tunnel extended to an area known as \"Salam 5,\" where divers found basalt base fragments similar to those from statues inside the sanctuary.</p><p>The team also found several stone and metal anchors of various shapes and sizes scattered near the reef, along with numerous broken amphorae that were recovered from inside the sunken harbor, all dating to the Ptolemaic period.</p>\n\n<p>Martinez told CBS News that, along with the discovery of seven shafts connected to an underground passage near the sanctuary of Taposiris Magna, linked with other subsurface structures and some contemporary buildings in front of the sanctuary, the findings \"strongly indicate that Taposiris Magna functioned as an active maritime zone with at least an inner harbor in antiquity.\"</p><p>\"The development of peripheral harbors, towards the decongestion of the central one in Alexandria, would be a matter of necessity. Taposiris Magna would be part of the network of peripheral harbor towns, providing access to Egypt from the west, and assisting in the distribution of Egyptian products across the Mediterranean,\" she said.</p>\n<p>As no ancient texts refer to a harbor at Taposiris Magna, the results of the research represent a significant contribution of new knowledge, throwing open an entirely new chapter in the history of the site, Martinez said.</p><h2>The quest for Cleopatra's tomb</h2><p>But while discovering the port is important, she's looking for something else. Like many other archaeologists, Martinez wants to find the tomb of Egypt's last queen, <span class=\"link\">Cleopatra VII</span>, who ruled from about 51 B.C. - 30 B.C. </p>\n\n<p>While many of her contemporaries in the field have long focused their hunt for Cleopatra's tomb among the ruins of <span class=\"link\">Alexandria's Royal Quarters</span>, Martinez has trained her sights for the last 20 years on Taposiris Magna.</p><p>\"I dedicated 10 years previous to that to studying Cleopatra's life and death,\" said Martinez.</p><p>The ancient queen allied herself with Roman general Mark Antony after Julius Caesar's death, to jointly face Caesar's heir Octavian (or Octavius). </p><p>When they were defeated at the Battle of Actium, they fled to Egypt. Octavius pursued them, and in 30 B.C. they both committed suicide separately, but they are believed by many historians to have been buried together in Alexandria.</p><p>Martinez, however, believes the tomb is actually in Taposiris Magna, about 30 miles further southwest down Egypt's Mediterranean coast. She considers it \"the perfect final resting place for Queen Cleopatra.\" </p><p>When she started the project, Martinez presented her hypothesis to Egyptian officials. </p><p>\"Of course, they didn't believe me,\" she told CBS News. </p>\n\n<p>She said she predicted they would find a necropolis at the site, likely from the time of Cleopatra. </p><p>\"We did,\" she told CBS News. \"We have already discovered and excavated 21 catacombs. We have a projection that at least we have 20 or 25 more…  We have more than 600 human remains and more than 30 mummies… And we will discover the tomb [of Cleopatra].\"</p>\n<p>There are archeologists who disagree with Martinez and stand by the theory that Cleopatra's tomb is in the Royal Quarters, in the center of ancient Alexandria. But she's unmoved.</p><p>\"It's not there, because the Romans hated Queen Cleopatra. And they wanted desperately to take her to Rome and parade her,\" Martinez told CBS News. \"Octavius would have done anything to bring Cleopatra to Rome and parade her in chains, and maybe give her the most horrible death that the Romans could inflict.\"  </p><p>\"But Cleopatra didn't want to go to Rome, and she tried to find a way to escape from that destiny and she wanted to stay in Egypt.\"</p><p>Martinez said the new Roman emperor could have taken her alive, or brought her remains to Rome, so she needed to secure a location where her remains could not be easily discovered, which she believes would have made the Royal Quarters a very unlikely choice.</p><p>Taposiris Magna was built as a temple dedicated to the goddess Isis, and Cleopatra, Martinez said, \"presented herself always, as the new Isis.\"</p>\n\n<p>She explained that the location had a strong religious context, and crucially, it was not under the control of the Romans at the time, unlike the Royal Quarters.</p><p>\"She outsmarted the Romans,\" said Martinez.</p><p>Martinez told CBS News that the team will continue their exploration of the harbor site in about a week, and it is set to go on for at least another two months.</p>\n<p>\"This is the first time that we're going to actually excavate underwater. It is going to be very exciting,\" she said, adding that nobody is known to have ever dived at the site before. \"We don't know what we're going to discover there because this is the beginning of the search.\"</p><p>\"It's a mystery. There was very little information about this place,\" she said. \"The site itself sometimes leads you in a certain direction.\" </p><p>For two millennia, Cleopatra has been successful in hiding the location of her remains, not just from the Romans, but from archaeologists.</p><p>Martinez has no hangups about dedicating herself to the quest for Cleopatra for nearly three decades.</p>\n\n<p>\"Well, it's a 2,000-year-old puzzle, and you are putting the pieces together,\"  she told CBS News, adding that she remains \"100% convinced that it's a matter of time\" before her work finally pays off.</p>\n\n</section>\n</div></body></html>"

People can vote online between 12 and 9 p.m. ET each day.</p><p>Bear lovers can also watch the fattened animals in their natural habitats in a series of livestreams on Explore.org, a multimedia organization that partners with the National Park Service to host the bear competition.</p>\n<h2>What is Fat Bear Week?</h2><p>Fat Bear Week began in 2014 as a one-day event, Sarah Bruce, a park ranger at <span class=\"link\">Katmai National Park and Preserve</span>, told CBS News.</p><p>\"It's a really great way to kind of showcase these bears that we have in southwest Alaska,\" Bruce said. \"It's very difficult to get to, so the cameras and Fat Bear Week make this park more accessible for folks who are unable to visit.\"</p><p>It was started by Explore.org resident naturalist and former park ranger Mike Fitz, who saw the size difference in the park's bears from late June to July — when they are most active along the river — compared to later in September.</p>\n\n<h2>How fat do the bears get?</h2><p>Scientists have estimated that the bears can pack on as much as 700 pounds as they get ready to hibernate for the winter, Bruce said. That means the bears can end up weighing more than 1,400 pounds.</p><p>\"They get super fat, and it's really important to get fat. A fat bear is a healthy bear,\" she explained. \"So they're eating about a year's worth of food within the span of five to six months. When they go into hibernation, they're not eating anymore, so they survive on their fat stores.\"</p><p>And what does the winner of Fat Bear Week get?</p><p>\"Their prize is winning and surviving another winter season, which is the most difficult season for these bears,\" Bruce said.</p>\n<h2>Meet the 2025 Fat Bear Week contenders</h2><p>Fat Bear Week contenders were announced during a livestream on Monday without issue, after last year's bracket reveal was <span class=\"link\">postponed following a skirmish</span> between two Alaskan grizzlies that led to the death of one of the animals.</p>\n\n<p>While around 80 bears frequent the Brooks River during their active season, 12 bears are chosen for Fat Bear Week because of certain criteria, including whether there are before and after photographs of the bears, park ranger and photographer Ashleigh Monaco said Monday.</p><p>Fitz said the competition is subjective and voters can place their vote for their favorite bear.</p><p>These are the bears vying to be this year's champion:</p><h3>128 Jr.</h3>\n<p>Fat Bear Jr. winner 128 Jr., or \"Biggie,\" is the offspring of 128. The dark fur bear is about 1 1/2 years old. She had a sibling who was unable to survive last summer, according to Monaco.</p><p>\"While it is tragic that that cub didn't survive, it just goes to show 128's strength and resiliency in overcoming the challenges of living on the Brooks River herself,\" Monaco said.</p><h3>609</h3>\n<p>Going against 128 Jr. in the bracket's first quadrant is 5-year-old 609, the daughter of 909 and the champion of Fat Bear Jr. 2022. She has noticeably large round ears and a long nose.</p><h3>602</h3>\n<p>Either 128 Jr. or 609 will face off against 602, a newbie to the competition. </p>\n\n<p>He loves lounging and taking long naps by the river, Monaco said, and he dominated the category of size and strength this summer. Nicknamed \"Flow-tato,\" 602 is often spotted doing \"a little stomping dance,\" possibly a response to high adrenaline or excitement.</p><h3>503</h3>\n<p>In the bracket's second quadrant is 503. The 12-year-old is resourceful, playful and tolerant, allowing the younger bears to sometimes take his leftovers.</p><h3>901</h3>\n<p>This 7-year-old bear has \"never been fatter,\" said Naomi Boak, a media ranger at Katmai. In 2023, 901 had three cubs, but none of them survived. </p><p>\"But she's back, and she's big,\" Boak said, adding that cubs could be in her future next season.</p><h3>32 Chunk</h3>\n<p>Either 503 or 901 will have to face 32 Chunk, the runner-up of last year's Fat Bear Week. He was among the most dominant bears last year, but this year he is healing from a broken jaw, possibly from an altercation with another male over a female, according to Boak. </p><p>\"That's a typical injury, and it's not an easy injury to live with, but he has powered through his injury,\" Boak said. \"He is fishing and he is getting fatter than ever.\"</p><h3>26</h3>\n<p>In the third quadrant is 26, a mother bear with twins \"with plenty of energy and spunk,\" said photographer Christine Loberg.</p>\n\n<h3>909</h3>\n<p>This is the daughter of the 2018 Fat Bear Week champion, 409 Beadnose. 909 loves catching fish by the waterfall, simply catching them with her mouth.</p><h3>128</h3>\n<p>The mother of this year's Fat Bear Jr. champion is approximately 20 years old. Also known as Grazer, she stands out with her blond fur.</p><h3>99</h3>\n<p>Bear 99 is identifiable by his chocolate milk-color coat, according to Bruce. While he's still quite young, he has got enough fish this year to land him in the fat bear bracket.</p><h3>856</h3>\n<p>The next bear in the fourth quadrant is 856, who Bruce called \"the old man of the river.\" He's one of the oldest bears on the Brooks River.</p><h3>910</h3>\n<p>The last 2025 Fat Bear Week contender is 910. She's described as a rectangle and a cruise ship because of how large she is.</p>\n\n</section>\n</div></body></html>"

It includes six pilots with experience in high-performance aircraft, a biomedical engineer, an anesthesiologist, a geologist and a former SpaceX launch director.</p><p>Among the new astronaut candidates is 39-year-old Anna Menon, a mother of two who flew to orbit in 2024 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon as a private astronaut on a commercial, non-NASA flight.</p><p>\"I am so thrilled to be back here with the NASA family,\" Menon said. \"As more and more people venture into space ... we have this awesome opportunity to learn a tremendous amount to help support those astronauts ... and help keep them healthy and safe. So it's an exciting time to be here.\"</p>\n\n<p>Menon worked for NASA for seven years as a biomedical researcher and flight controller before joining SpaceX in 2018. She served as a senior engineer and was later selected as the onboard medical officer during the commercial <span class=\"link\">Polaris Dawn</span> mission, chartered by billionaire Jared Isaacman.</p>\n<p>She married her husband, Anil, in 2016 while both were working for NASA. A former Air Force flight surgeon, Anil Menon joined SpaceX as its first medical officer in 2018. He joined NASA's astronaut corps in 2021 and is now assigned to a long-duration space station crew scheduled for launch aboard a Russian Soyuz next summer.</p><p>Anna and Anil Menon are among several couples who served in the astronaut corps at the same time. But only one couple ever flew in orbit together — shuttle astronauts Mark Lee and Jan Davis in 1992.</p><p>The other members of the 2025 astronaut class are:</p><ul><li>Army Chief Warrant Officer 3 Ben Bailey, 38, a graduate of the Naval Test Pilot School with more than 2,000 hours flying more than 30 different aircraft, including recent work with UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47F Chinook helicopters.</li><li>Lauren Edgar, 40, who holds a Ph.D. in geology from the California Institute of Technology, with experience supporting NASA's Mars exploration rovers and, more recently, serving as a deputy principal investigator with NASA's Artemis 3 moon landing mission.</li><li>Air Force Maj.

In addition, crew sizes are expected to be reduced.</p><p>It's not clear how many of the new astronauts might be able to fly to the ISS before it's retired or how many might eventually walk on the moon. Whether NASA can get there before the Chinese, who are targeting the end of the decade for <span class=\"link\">their own moon landing mission</span>, is also uncertain.</p>\n<p>But Duffy assured the new astronaut candidates that NASA will, in fact, beat China back to the moon.</p><p>\"Some are challenging our leadership in space, say, like the Chinese,\" he said. \"And I'll just tell you this: I'll be damned if the Chinese beat NASA or beat America back to the moon. We are going to win ... the second space race back to the moon, with all of you participating in that great effort.\"</p><p>As for flights to Mars, which the Trump administration supports, flights are not yet on the drawing board, and most experts say no such NASA mission is likely to launch within the next decade and probably longer.</p>\n\n</section>\n</div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><section class=\"content__body\">\n<p>President Trump signed an executive order Monday labeling antifa a \"domestic terrorist organization\" — though the move's legal impact is unclear.</p><p>The executive order directs Trump administration officials to investigate and thwart \"any and all illegal operations\" allegedly carried out by antifa members, and to pursue people who \"fund such operations\" or provide material support to them.</p><p>The president <span class=\"link\">promised to designate antifa</span> as a \"major terrorist organization\" last week in the wake of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, although officials have not said there was a link between his killing and any left-wing groups. </p><p>It's not clear what happens next. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, typically refers to a loose affiliation of mostly left-wing activists, and isn't generally considered to be an organized group with a clear leadership structure. And the U.S. doesn't have a statute that gives the president the power to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations or charge people with domestic terrorism, legal experts <span class=\"link\">told CBS News</span> last week.</p><p>In a fact sheet, the White House argued antifa \"has a long history of terrorizing our communities.\" It listed out several attacks on or threats against law enforcement agencies and pro-Trump events in recent years, some of which were allegedly carried out by people who self-identified with antifa. </p>\n\n<p>The White House also cited Kirk's assassination as an example of a \"trend of Radical Left violence.\" Authorities say Kirk's suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, had become \"more political\" in recent years and lashed out against Kirk's \"hatred\" in text messages, though they have not released evidence tying Robinson to antifa.</p><p>In 2020, the Congressional Research Service called antifa a \"decentralized\" movement made up of \"independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals\" who typically believe in socialism, communism and anarchism. It said followers of antifa lack a singular organizational structure, set of ideological views or common list of enemies.</p><p>University of Pittsburgh professor Michael Kenney told CBS News last week there is \"no single organization called antifa,\" adding: \"There's tremendous variation inside that movement, even on issues like political violence.\"</p><p>The antifa movement's roots date back to opponents of neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan in the 1980s, and an Oregon-based group became the first organization to use the term \"antifa\" in its name in 2007, according to the Congressional Research Service. The group gained more attention a decade later, during the clashes between far-right groups and their opponents in Charlottesville, Virginia, early in Mr. Trump's first term.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Trump and his appointees first vowed to crack down on antifa in his first term, with the president calling for antifa to be designated a terrorist group in 2020. He did not follow through on that threat.</p><p>In 2017, then-FBI Director Chris Wray told Congress the agency was carrying out \"anarchist extremist investigations\" against suspects \"who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology,\" CRS notes. Three years later, Wray described antifa as a \"movement or an ideology,\" not a singular group.</p><p>Mr. Trump's latest push could face legal hurdles. Unlike with foreign terrorist organizations, there isn't a legal mechanism for the president to designate a domestic terrorist group, Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, told CBS News last week. But the administration could choose to make antifa-related incidents a higher priority for federal law enforcement, he noted.</p><p>Domestic terrorism also is not a chargeable offense under federal law, though most states have a domestic terrorism statute, and other federal criminal statutes could be applied to alleged domestic terrorists.</p><p>\"You can't prosecute an ideology,\" Baumgartner said.</p>\n\n</section>\n</div></body></html>"

Long considered a cause of the left, the animal rights movement has expanded and gained steam under the Trump administration. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is leading the charge against high drug costs, vaccine safety and the grinding approval process required to bring innovations to market.</p>\n<p>Animal tests, often involving painful experiments that end in euthanasia, have played a crucial role in developing novel vaccines for <span class=\"link\">COVID-19</span>, malaria, polio and popular medications such as Tylenol and <span class=\"link\">Ozempic</span>, which ushered in a craze for <span class=\"link\">weight-loss drugs</span>.</p>\n\n<p>\"In conventional medicine, those procedures, those diagnostics, those therapeutics, for the most part, were discovered in animals,\" said Steven Marks, the dean of the veterinary school at Clemson University. \"But they're changing the landscape of human health right now.\" </p><p>No one knows where it will end.</p><p>Since President Trump <span class=\"link\">took office</span>, all major federal health agencies have promised to phase out animal research, with varying degrees of effectiveness. The Veterans Administration says it is on track, as promised, to end all primate research that's been used to develop new treatments for neurological disorders, alcoholism and mental problems.</p><p>The sprawling National Institutes of Health has agreed to phase out experiments with dogs, cats and primates, but watchdogs have found recent examples of the agency launching new animal research. Federal money has continued to flow to incomplete research projects and to contractors who breed and care for thousands of animals bound for laboratories.</p>\n\n<p>The effort has sparked uncertainty in South Carolina, where a research company maintains a free-ranging monkey colony on secluded Morgan Island, where nearly 4,000 federally owned rhesus monkeys bask in the sun until they are shipped off to federal laboratories. </p><p>U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, a Charleston Republican, has been a leader in the animal rights fight, joined by White Coat Waste, a group that counts billionaire <span class=\"link\">Elon Musk</span> among its supporters. Mace has introduced legislation to end federally funded animal research. She also recently inserted language in a House spending bill to force the NIH to justify continued spending on Morgan Island, which is more popularly known as \"Monkey Island.\" </p><p>\"Honestly, it's heartbreaking,\" Goodman told CBS News and The Post and Courier on a recent visit to waters surrounding the island.</p><p>As Goodman watched, rhesus mothers and babies romped on the island's sandy beach and stared down from palmetto trees. But each year, hundreds are \"taken from this wild habitat with their friends, with their families and shipped to laboratories. They're gonna be socially isolated in tiny cages by themselves and subjected to some of the most barbaric painful experiments you can imagine,\" he said.</p><p>His group's mission, Goodman said, is to \"slash as much animal funding as possible.\"</p><p>Patients who stand to benefit from continued animal research hang in the balance. Animal experiments have helped develop breakthrough drugs, like the immunotherapy that's saving the life of 11-month-old Max Harbin of Folly Beach, South Carolina. Max has a spinal condition that once ranked as the leading genetic cause of infant deaths.</p><p>Before Max's therapy was approved for pediatric use in 2019, it went through years of studies with mice and monkeys. A Food and Drug Administration official described the therapy as a way to \"change the lives of those patients who may have faced a terminal condition.\"</p>\n\n<p>Max's mother Laura, an animal lover, said she was unaware of the rigorous animal experiments that led to human approval for Zolgensma, a single-dose therapy made by Novartis.</p><p>\"It's odd to think that it's a step in the process, but it's a necessary one, and without it, my son would be in a very, very different place. I'm definitely grateful there's a way to test it so we know it's safe.\"</p><p>Now, the FDA is now among the agencies promising to make a \"paradigm shift\" in how new drugs are approved.</p><p>It wants to use new techniques like AI-based computational modeling, lab testing on human organs and data analysis to \"get safer treatments to patients faster and more reliably while also reducing R&amp;D costs and drug prices,\" said FDA commissioner Martin Makary. \"It is a win-win for public health and ethics.\"</p><p>There's still a major hurdle with phasing out all federal animal research. The science behind alternatives is rapidly evolving, but many experts say it's not yet ready to serve as the only gauge of safety and effectiveness in humans.</p><p>\"I want to see us get out of the business of using animals in research,\" said Paul Locke, who is an environmental health lawyer at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and serves on the board of the school's Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing. \"The question is when. When can we do that and reach the double goal of having better science and virtually no animals? The answer is not tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p>Locke testified this year at a congressional hearing organized by Mace about the need for federal agencies to step up in support of alternative research and \"set the global standards in these fields.\"</p>\n\n<p>The hearing won more attention, including supportive social media posts from President Trump, about Mace's charge that the federal government spent more than $10 million to create transgender mice and other animals and study their behaviors.</p><p>Parents like Justin and Rosalyn Porcano in San Rafael, California, are watching the debate with concern. Their 7-year-old daughter Lia has a rare genetic disorder, Usher Syndrome 1B. She was born deaf and is facing blindness, with no treatments currently available. Without medical advancements in treatment of the disorder, she will likely go blind by the time she's in high school. </p>\n<p>The Porcanos found a primate researcher at the Oregon National Primate Research Center who, with the family's help, is developing a model that will allow for development of an effective treatment. The lab work is ongoing as the debate in Washington intensifies.</p><p>The couple, who run a nonprofit called Save Sight Now that is dedicated to finding treatments for Usher Syndrome 1B, said they would prefer an alternative to animal testing, but it makes no sense to them to pause research until a better solution comes along. Lia doesn't have that luxury of time, Rosalyn Porcano said.</p><p>\"Until technology and science has a better solution for testing, I think that's idiotic,\" said Justin Porcano. \"You can't just stop testing in all animal models right now. It's a crazy concept.\"</p><p><em>Post and Courier Reporter Mitchell Black contributed to this report.</em></p>\n\n</section>\n</div></body></html>"

      "content": "<html><body><div><section class=\"content__body\">\n<p>President Trump announced the Food and Drug Administration believes the use of acetaminophen — the active ingredient in Tylenol and many cold and flu medications — during pregnancy can be associated with an increased risk of autism, though medical experts have said the medication is safe.  </p><p>\"Effective immediately, the FDA will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,\" the president said. \"So, taking Tylenol is not good, alright? I'll say it. It's not good. For this reason, they are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary.\"  </p><p>\"Ideally, a woman won't take Tylenol,\" he said, and pivoted to discussion of childhood vaccination, saying vaccines should be given in \"smaller doses\" and spread out \"over a period of years,\" without citing medical evidence for his claims about vaccines. On his various vaccine recommendations, the president said, \"You know, I'm just making these statements from me, I'm not making them from these doctors.\"</p><p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the FDA based its decision on acetaminophen on \"clinical and laboratory studies\" that \"suggest a potential association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes,\" including one study in the public health journal Environmental Health, but added that \"NIH [National Institutes of Health] research teams are currently testing multiple hypotheses.\"</p><p>However, in a major study published last year, researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found that acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.</p>\n\n<p>After Mr. Trump's announcement, the FDA shared an open letter encouraging physicians to \"consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy for routine low-grade fevers\" — though the agency was more cautious than some of the president's statements.</p><p>\"To be clear, while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature,\" the letter states, calling the issue an \"ongoing area of scientific debate.\"</p><p>The letter also stated physicians should balance the possible risks of acetaminophen with the fact that it is still safer than other over-the-counter painkillers and fever-reducing drugs during pregnancy, like aspirin and ibuprofen.</p><p>The announcement comes after Kennedy said in April that HHS <span class=\"link\">would undertake</span> a \"massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism. Kennedy at the time said the plan was to release a comprehensive report in September. However, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya <span class=\"link\">said later that month</span> it could be as long as a year before the findings are released.</p>\n\n<p>\"To meet the president's challenge, I ordered HHS to launch unprecedented, all-agency effort to identify all causes of autism, including toxic and pharmaceutical exposures,\" Kennedy said.</p><p>FDA Commissioner Marty Makary also announced FDA approval of the drug <span class=\"link\">leucovorin to treat autism</span> in children. It has previously been used off-label for that purpose.</p><p>Autism has become <span class=\"link\">more prevalent</span> in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there is no scientific consensus on the reasons why. Most experts say it is likely due to a combination of factors, including changes in the way the condition is diagnosed.  </p><h2>Tylenol maker responds to autism claims</h2><p>In a statement to CBS News, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said \"independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism.\"</p><p>\"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise,\" the statement continues, highlighting what the company says is the greater health risk for expecting mothers from other conditions if they give up on taking the drug. \"Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.\"</p><p>\"The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism,\" the company said, adding that it \"will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children.\" </p><h2>Medical experts on acetaminophen and autism research</h2><p>In a statement to CBS News when reports of the administration's plans first surfaced, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) said, \"There is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\" </p>\n\n<p>Following the administration's announcement Monday, ACOG President Dr. Steven J. Fleischman said in a statement: \"Suggestions that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism are not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients, including those who may need to rely on this beneficial medicine during pregnancy.\"</p><p>\"Today's announcement by HHS is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children,\" Fleischman said. \"It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data.\"</p><p>\"The best evidence does not show an association between Tylenol and autism,\" said Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. \"The medical community, the scientific community has the same consensus, which is that Tylenol, acetaminophen, is safe in pregnancy.\"</p><p>Gounder said acetaminophen is considered the safest option for treating issues like pain and high fever during pregnancy.</p><p>\"If you have a high fever during pregnancy, that can cause neurodevelopment issues in the baby, so you don't want to let that fever go untreated,\" Gounder explained, adding she's worried that expectant mothers may turn to other options that would be less safe. </p><p>\"Will women end up taking other medications like aspirin or ibuprofen during pregnancy? Those actually can be dangerous, especially in the third trimester, you can end up with kidney issues, cardiac issues in the baby,\" she said.</p><p>While some previous research suggested there could be a possible association between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, those studies involved relatively small groups and did not prove a link. Larger and more robust studies have found no connection.</p>\n\n<p>\"Any association between acetaminophen and autism is based on limited, conflicting, and inconsistent science and is premature given the current science,\" the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement. </p><p>The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents some of the largest makers of over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, said, \"Safety is the top priority for manufacturers,\" and \"the well-established profile of acetaminophen is supported by decades of research and real-world use.\"</p><p>\"Scientific and medical authorities around the world recognize acetaminophen as the only analgesic considered safe for use during pregnancy when used according to the Drug Facts label, which specifically reminds pregnant women to always consult their healthcare provider before use,\" the group said.</p><h2>What is leucovorin?</h2><p>FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said autism \"may also be due to an autoimmune reaction to a folate receptor on the brain not allowing that important vitamin to get into the brain cells.\" </p><p>He announced FDA approval of the drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid (also known as folate or vitamin B9), to treat autism in children. Leucovorin is an inexpensive, generic drug that was previously approved to ease the side effects of cancer chemotherapy. </p><p>Pregnant women are prescribed multivitamins with folic acid to prevent neural tube defects. The neural tube develops into the brain and spinal cord. </p><p>Specialists say <span class=\"link\">leucovorin can be helpful</span> in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.</p>\n\n<p>\"You can have a perfectly normal folate level in your blood, but it may not be getting into the brain, and so there's a defect in the transport of folate into the brain. Leucovorin works around that,\" Gounder explained. \"Not all children with autism have this defect, so there's a test you can do to assess whether that's what's at play. For those kids, leucovorin has been shown to help, particularly with speech, getting kids to be more verbal than they were before.\"</p><p>Leucovorin isn't a cure for autism, but \"it could really have a substantial impact on a very good percentage of children with autism,\" Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, <span class=\"link\">told CBS News earlier this year</span>.</p>\n\n</section>\n</div></body></html>"

      "image_url": "",
      "content": "<html><body><div><section class=\"content__body\">\n<p>The Trump administration's <span class=\"link\">new $100,000 fee</span> for H-1B visa applications is sowing confusion among some immigrant workers and their employers, including whether it's safe for current holders of the visa to travel outside the U.S.</p><p>The new fee, which President Trump announced in a proclamation on Friday, represents a major change to a 35-year-old program that has enabled millions of immigrants to work legally in the U.S. The visa has become a mainstay in the technology industry, including among bellwethers such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, and is also widely used in the financial sector.</p><p>Over the weekend, the White House sought to clarify the new policy, stating that the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and that it is a one-time cost required only when initially applying for the visa.</p><p>White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said the addition of a $100,000 charge for H-1B visas on top of the existing fees reflects President Trump's promise \"to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"</p><p>She added, \"The text of the proclamation is very clear, and it is unfortunate that uninformed reporters and corporate lawyers attempt to sow chaos and confusion. Americans have another reason to celebrate unprecedented action by President Trump to protect Americans from cheap foreign labor.\"</p>\n\n<p>After the White House outlined the new policy on Friday, some tech companies including Google and Microsoft this weekend instructed H-1B employees who were traveling outside the U.S. to return immediately, expressing concern they might not be allowed to re-enter without the $100,000 payment, according to workers and immigration lawyers. </p><p>Despite the White House's clarification that the new fee applies only to new visa applications, not existing H-1B holders, there remains \"a great degree of uncertainty on the ground,\" Parul Koul, president of the union that represents employees at Google owner Alphabet, said during a press conference on Monday to address the new policy. </p><p>CBS News spoke with attorneys and other sources about the new policy — here's what to know. </p><h2>Who pays the $100,000 fee? </h2><p>Under current H-1B rules, employers pay the application fees on behalf of workers. Assuming that approach continues, that could deter many employers from picking up the additional $100,000 fees — roughly 10 times what they previously paid for an applicant, Emily Neumann, an immigration attorney and managing partner at Houston-based Reddy Neumann Brown, told CBS MoneyWatch. </p>\n\n<p>\"Very few employers would be willing to shell out that kind of money,\" she said. </p><p>Such an outcome would appear to align with the White House's goals of spurring employers to hire within the U.S. rather than recruiting foreign workers.</p><p>\"It is therefore necessary to impose higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers,\" Mr. Trump said in his order. </p><h2>When does the fee go into effect? </h2><p>The new fee must be paid in submitting any new H-1B visa application and went into effect at 12:01 am EST on Sept. 21, according to a White House statement. </p><p>Each year, the federal government approves 85,000 H-1B visas for highly skilled non-U.S. workers, who typically require at least a bachelor's degree and a skill in a highly specialized field, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. An estimated 700,000 people in the U.S. hold a H-1B visa, according to Capital Economics.</p><p>The USCIS says it has already reached its applicant cap for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. That means those applications would be excluded from having to pay the fee, but new applicants filing during the next fiscal year would be subject to it, Neumann explained.  </p><h2>What are the main issues for current H-1B holders? </h2><p>According to the White House, the proclamation \"does not prevent any holder of a current H-1B visa from traveling in and out of the United States.\"</p>\n\n<p>H-1B visas are valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years. A White House official said the one-time $100,000 fee is only charged when applying for a visa for the first time — the payment is not required for current visa holders or those renewing the document, and those fees aren't changing. </p><p>Yet the new rules leave some gray areas for current H-1B holders, Neumann said. For instance, the new fee is targeted at new visa applicants residing outside the U.S. That raises questions about whether current H-1B visa holders who are applying for changes, such as a visa renewal or a change of employer, might be caught up in the new requirement if they leave the U.S., Neumann and other immigration attorneys said.</p><p>\"Where the question comes in is, what if after September 21 they file that extension and then they need to travel — are they going to be expected to pay that in order to get back into the U.S.?\" she said. \"That's kind of an open question right now.\"</p><p>Although the White House said the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and won't impact their travel, Neumann said she believes more guidance is needed because the White House's Sept. 21 FAQ notes the fee applies to \"any other H-1B petitions submitted after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025.\"</p><p>\"This makes it sound like it could apply to an employee who travels with any petition filed after September 21, 2025. Although it seems clear that it does not apply to individuals currently in the United States, it is not clear how it impacts those who later travel and have a petition filed after the relevant date,\" she said.</p><p>For now, Neumann said she is advising her corporate clients to direct their H-1B employees not to leave the U.S.. That was echoed by Jeff Joseph, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association and an immigration attorney.</p><p>\"Until we have more clarification, which hopefully we'll have soon, we're telling people to just sit tight and not travel,\" Joseph said.</p>\n\n<p>Asked about the issue of H-1B holders who are applying for a change and who travel outside the U.S., the White House said the one-time $100,000 fee doesn't apply to renewals or current visa holders.</p><h2>How does the new fee impact the H-1B program? </h2><p>The $100,000 fee is likely to have a \"chilling effect\" on skilled foreign workers moving to the U.S.<strong>,</strong> Joseph of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said.</p><p>Although the tech industry has long been the biggest beneficiary of the H-1B program, the visa is designed for highly skilled workers across many industries, he added. Employers who rely on the visa include those in health care, which often recruit medical professionals outside the U.S. in areas where they have shortages, he said.</p><p>More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders come from a range of countries, including Canada, South Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a 2022 USCIS report.</p><h2>What about the national security exemption?</h2><p>A provision in Mr. Trump's proclamation exempts some workers, companies and even entire industries from the new $100,000 fee if they are deemed to support the \"national interest\" and are adjudged not to pose a threat to the security or welfare of the U.S. </p><p>For now, however, it's unclear how to receive such an exemption, including which federal agency will be charged with approving them, Neumann said. </p><p>\"There's no guidance out there yet,\" she said. \"What are the national interest exemptions going to be? How would a company apply for that, if they can get the entire company to get the exemption? How would the individual apply?\"</p>\n\n<p>The White House didn't respond to questions about how the national security exemption would be applied or which agency will be handling the issue.</p>\n\n</section>\n</div></body></html>"

      "image_url": "",
      "content": "<html><body><div><section class=\"content__body\">\n<p>Recent reports in the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal say President Trump and Health Secretary <span class=\"link\">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</span> are <span class=\"link\">expected to announce</span> that the use of Tylenol by pregnant women may be linked to autism in children. But many top medical experts in the field say the evidence does not support that.</p><p>This comes after Kennedy said in April that HHS <span class=\"link\">would undertake</span> a \"massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism. Kennedy at the time said the plan was to release a comprehensive report in September. However, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya <span class=\"link\">said later that month</span> the findings could take up to a year.</p><p>Kennedy has in the past made the unfounded claim that autism is a \"preventable disease,\" drawing heavy criticism from many medical experts, who say evidence shows there are multiple factors, including genetics, that play a role. </p><p>In a statement provided to CBS News on Sept. 5, an HHS spokesperson said, \"We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America's unprecedented rise in autism rates. Until we release the final report, any claims about its contents are nothing more than speculation.\"</p><h2>What does Tylenol maker Kenvue say about autism?</h2><p>In response to the WSJ story on Sept. 5, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol — whose active ingredient is acetaminophen — said: \"We have continuously evaluated the science and continue to believe there is no causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and leading medical organizations agree on the safety of acetaminophen, its use during pregnancy, and the information provided on the label.\"</p>\n\n<p>Kenvue added, \"We appreciate the Secretary acknowledging media coverage on the upcoming HHS report is 'nothing more than speculation.'\" </p><p>In another statement on Sept. 21, the company said:</p><blockquote><p>\"We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.</p><p>Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives. </p><p>The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism. We stand with the many public health and medical professionals who have reviewed this science and agree. We will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children.\"</p></blockquote><h2>What do medical experts say?</h2><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement provided to CBS News that \"there is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\" </p><p>\"Neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular, are multifactorial and very difficult to associate with a singular cause,\" ACOG said. \"Pregnant patients should not be frightened away from the many benefits of acetaminophen, which is safe and one of the few options pregnant people have for pain relief.\"</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Christopher Zahn, ACOG's chief of clinical practice, said, \"Pregnant patients should not be frightened away from the many benefits of acetaminophen, which is safe and one of the few options pregnant people have for pain relief.\"</p><p>\"If you have a high fever during pregnancy, that can cause neurodevelopment issues in the baby, so you don't want to let that fever go untreated,\" said Dr. Céline Goudner, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. She said pregnant women should talk with their OB-GYN, especially if they're needing it frequently, and use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time.</p><p>While some research suggested there could be a possible association between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, those studies involved relatively small groups and did not prove a link. Larger and more robust studies have found no connection between acetaminophen and autism.</p><p>\"I spoke this afternoon to a researcher who was part of a major study published just last year that followed 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said after the WSJ report came out. \"He said use of acetaminophen ... was not associated with an increased risk of autism in children.\" </p><p>LaPook said he is looking forward to reading the upcoming report pledged by Kennedy, \"especially the evidence behind any conclusions and recommendations.\"</p><p>Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there is no scientific consensus on the reasons why.  </p><p>Research shows the causes of autism \"are complex,\" Dr. Christine Ladd-Acosta, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the vice director for the Wendy Klag Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities, told CBS News in an interview.</p>\n\n<p>\"There have been a few dozen studies looking at Tylenol and whether use during pregnancy is associated with risk of autism in those women's children, and the evidence has been really kind of conflicting,\" Ladd-Acosta said. \"Some studies have shown no association. Some have shown a positive association. Some have shown negative associations. And I think part of that is because it's really hard to tease apart ... whether it's the medication itself that is influencing autism risk in the child, or if it has to do with the condition ... the mother is using the medicine to treat that is the thing that is important in autism risk.\" </p><p>Ladd-Acosta noted that the dosage, the length of time that pregnant women take Tylenol, and the \"specific condition\" they are taking it for are all factors that have been considered when attempting to determine if there is a potential association between the medication and autism. </p><p>\"There have been some associations, but there has been no conclusive evidence I've seen to show that Tylenol itself causes autism definitively,\" Ladd-Acosta said. </p>\n<p class=\"content__meta--contributors\">\nAparna  Zalani\n                  \n        contributed to this report.\n    </p>\n</section>\n</div></body></html>"
