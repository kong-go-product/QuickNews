<div class="article-title">Mets announcers criticize Cubs player Matt Shaw for leaving team to attend Charlie Kirk's funeral</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New York Mets broadcaster Gary Cohen criticized Chicago Cubs player Matt Shaw for missing one of the team's games this past weekend to attend Charlie Kirk's funeral. </p><p>Cohen's comments came during SNY's broadcast of the Mets' game against the Cubs on Tuesday night, while Shaw was up to bat in fourth inning, calling the decision "weird." </p><p>"I don't want to talk about any of the politics of it, but the thought of leaving your team in the middle of a race for any reason other than a family emergency, really strikes me as weird," Cohen said. </p><p>Fellow Mets broadcaster Todd Zeile called Shaw's absence "unprecedented." </p><p>"It's unusual, I think it's unprecedented at least from my experience as a player, and I think it made it a little more unusual that it was not revealed until after it came to issue because he was thought to be in the dugout and maybe available, and was not, and that's how it was revealed," Zeile said. </p><p>Cohen and Zeile were criticized on social media for their comments about Shaw's absence. </p><p>Shaw missed the Cubs’ 1-0 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday to attend the memorial service in Glendale, though manager Craig Counsell mentioned to the media that Shaw wasn’t available for the game because he was at a funeral for a friend. </p><p>Shaw explained why he made it a point to attend the memorial despite his team’s schedule.</p><p>"My connection with Charlie was through our [Christian] faith," Shaw said before the Cubs opened a new series with the New York Mets on Tuesday, per the Chicago Sun-Times. "And that’s something that drives me every day, the reason why I’m able to do what I do every day, and that’s something I’m extremely thankful for. </p><p>"I know without my faith and without the many blessings I’ve been given in my life, that I wouldn’t be here, be able to talk to you guys, able to help this team eventually go and win championships.</p><p>"That’s something I feel really, really blessed about, so whatever backlash comes is OK. I feel strong about my faith and that what was meant to be happened."</p><p>Shaw added that he and Kirk became friends last offseason as they lived in the same apartment complex in Arizona. The two stayed in contact throughout the MLB season, Shaw said. </p><p>Shaw said he was emotional when he found out Kirk was assassinated while at a speaking event at Utah Valley University Sept. 10. </p><p>"When that happened, a lot of emotions came over me," he explained. "I didn’t foresee that happening. I don’t know how to describe everything that happened, how I was feeling, But I will say I was tearing up pretty good. I had a lot of [teammates] supporting me, and that will be something I’ll remember for my entire life."</p><p>Shaw had been scratched from the Cubs’ lineup that night before a game against the Atlanta Braves. </p><p>Kirk, a native of Arlington Heights, a northern suburb of Chicago, was "one of the biggest Cubs fans I ever Met," according to Shaw. In fact, Shaw said it was Erika Kirk, his widow, who asked him to attend the memorial. After a conversation with Counsell and some teammates, Shaw felt his decision to attend was accepted. </p><p>"The reason Charlie and I connected so close was because of our faith," Shaw added. "That’s something that drives me every single day, something that I think about all the time. So, if people are wondering who I am and what I stand for, I’d say that my faith and the many blessings I’ve been given are why I’m able to be here, and I just want to make sure that I can give that back to people, that I can support people around me, that I can love people around me the same way that I’ve been blessed."</p><p>The Cubs were among the MLB teams to pay tribute to Kirk, calling for an end to "all political violence." </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, a Wisconsin Republican, has announced a Badger State gubernatorial bid.</p><p>"Madison politics may smell like the barn, but I know how to clean up the bull. I will roll up my sleeves and deliver results for every Wisconsinite," he says in a campaign video.</p><p>"I will freeze property taxes, protect our farmland from Communist China, and I'll preserve our Wisconsin values, just like my mom does with her pickles," he says in the video.</p><p>Tiffany began serving in the U.S. House of Representatives in May 2020 after winning a special election that month to fill the House seat vacated in 2019 by Republican Sean Duffy.</p><p>Duffy is currently serving as secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation.</p><p>President Donald Trump won Wisconsin in 2024 and 2016 but lost it in 2020.</p><p>The governor's race will be an open contest since current Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, announced earlier this year that he will not run for a third term.</p><p>Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann, who is also vying for the governorship, said in a post on X, "Welcome to the race, @TomTiffanyWI! Looking forward to a Republican primary focused on ideas and winning back the governor’s office."</p><p>Manufacturer and former Navy SEAL Bill Berrien, another gubernatorial hopeful, declared in a post, "After years of bureaucratic leadership in Madison, the last thing we need is another career politician at the helm. Instead, we need builders who will create prosperity for all through work, revitalize the manufacturing infrastructure that lies dormant in our state, and jumpstart our economy. As the only builder in this race, I’m the strongest general election candidate Democrats will face — and they know it!"</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Syria’s new president takes center stage at UNGA as concerns linger over terrorist past</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Once a member of al Qaeda and the Islamic State and now leading Syria’s fragile transition since toppling the Bashar Assad regime, Ahmed al-Sharaa is ready to take to the global center stage at the United Nations General Assembly Wednesday and make his case for a new path forward for his war-torn nation.</p><p>"This marks the first participation in high-level meetings of a Syrian president at the United Nations General Assembly since 1967, so this is a very big deal," Natasha Hall, senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Fox News Digital.</p><p>"On such a historic occasion, what he will try to emphasize and underline is that this is a new day for Syria. They have overthrown the brutal dictatorship of the Assad regime. He will talk about the progress that's been made and what more progress needs to happen in terms of recognition and the lifting of U.N. sanctions to help Syria move forward," Hall added.</p><p>A high-ranking Syrian government official confirmed to Fox News Digital that al-Sharaa will use the opportunity at the U.N. to present Syria’s vision for stability, reconstruction, and reconciliation.</p><p>"The most important issues he will raise include the need to lift all forms of unilateral sanctions that continue to hinder Syria’s recovery, the importance of combating terrorism in all its forms, the return of displaced Syrians and refugees, and the advancement of a genuinely inclusive political process rooted in the will of the Syrian people," the Syrian official said.</p><p>Al-Sharaa, who led the Islamist rebel group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) to victory over Assad, ditched his military fatigues for a Western-style suit and has been on a charm offensive, hosting European and Western diplomats and politicians in hopes of bringing Syria out from its international pariah status.</p><p>The new Syrian leader received an unprecedented endorsement from President Donald Trump when the two met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in May. </p><p>Trump called al-Sharaa a "young, attractive, tough guy," announcing that the U.S. would lift sanctions in place since the Assad era and even discussed normalizing relations. </p><p>Hall noted that al-Sharaa might be looking to secure a security pact between Israel and Syria along the UNGA sidelines, emphasizing that he seeks a Syria that is at peace with its neighbors and doesn't want to position Syria to be a threat to any outside forces, particularly Israel. </p><p>He will also be looking to secure much-needed reconstruction aid to rebuild a country ravaged by 13 years of civil war. The cost for reconstruction is estimated to be between $250 and $400 billion, and 16.7 million people, or 75% of the population, are in dire need of humanitarian assistance, according to the U.N.</p><p>Since seizing Damascus, he has publicly said all the right things. He promised an inclusive government that would represent all religious and ethnic factions in Syria, uphold women’s rights, and protect minority rights.</p><p>Al-Sharaa also fulfilled promises to target ISIS and other terrorist groups operating in Syria. One month after taking power, Syrian security forces seized a shipment of heavy ammunition destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon, once a key ally of the Assad regime and Iran’s Axis of Resistance.</p><p>While optimism for a new Syria remains high, some caution it’s still too soon to judge al-Sharaa as a Western ally given his terrorist past.</p><p>"Al-Sharaa is not a democrat. He ruled Idlib without power-sharing. So far, in terms of control of vital government functions like security, foreign affairs, intelligence and justice, he has put loyalists in place," former U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Ford, who was the last U.S. ambassador in Damascus in 2011, said the crucial question is whether, over time, individual political and civil liberties will be respected and that people maintain, as they have now, the freedom to organize and protest.</p><p>"Al-Sharaa's heavy hand ruling Idlib prior to Assad's fall has been lighter in Damascus, Aleppo and elsewhere. But so far, there is more political freedom to speak and protest in Syria than in many other countries in the region, such as Egypt, Algeria and some Gulf states," Ford added.</p><p>Ambassador Barbara Leaf, who served as assistant secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, visited Damascus and met with Shara in December, becoming the highest-ranking official to meet with Syrian leadership since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011. </p><p>Leaf, a distinguished diplomatic fellow with the Middle East Institute, told Fox News Digital about her initial contact with Shara right after HTS overthrew Assad. Her mission was to get eyes on him, to assess him and to send a clear signal on U.S. expectations if he was going to lead a new Syria.</p><p>"My takeaway from the meeting was that he came across as somebody who was very well-prepared for the discussion. He had clearly anticipated all of the topics that I raised and he had pretty thoughtful responses with a readiness to engage," she said.</p><p>Al-Sharaa made a point several times to say that Syria would no longer be a threat or a staging point for threats against its neighbors, including Israel, and that he would not allow the Iranians, Hezbollah, or Palestinian groups, to use Syrian territory to conduct terrorist activities, the ambassador said.</p><p>"I came to the sense that he was already making a shift from being a military commander to being a politician, to being a political leader," Ambassador Leaf noted.</p><p>While Ambassador Leaf highlighted his pragmatism, his true intentions as the new leader of Syria remain murky.</p><p>The ambassador said that it appears al-Sharaa has traveled a trajectory away from his jihadist terrorist past, but it remains a question how far he is willing to go to effectuate what she believes is an intention to form an Islamist style of governance.</p><p>"Does he want to formulate a kind of Islamist governance, conservative governance and social order that, frankly, Syria has not seen? And would he be willing to use force to get there? That's an unknown," the ambassador cautioned.</p><p>What’s concerning for Ambassador Leaf and others is that many of the people serving in key roles in the transitional government are close associates of al-Sharaa and others affiliated with HTS and other allied armed rebel groups. </p><p>"Al-Sharaa is still engaged in a careful balancing act within his own government between liberal opposition voices, former regime bureaucrats and more Islamist proponents aligned still with HTS’ mission and principles," Caroline Rose, director of The New Lines Institute, told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Rose, who traveled to Syria earlier this year, said that Syria's complex political dynamics have led not only to gridlock but even incapacity in times of crisis, "such as failure to rein in radical Sunni fighters during violent outbreaks in Latakia and Suwayda, but also policies appeasing more conservative elements of al-Sharaa’s support network, such as the ruling requiring full-body swimwear at Syrian pools and beaches."</p><p>While Syria’s new government has looked to consolidate control over a restive society, Shara’s forces had to manage a fragile society divided along ethnic and religious lines.</p><p>Syria has experienced a wave of sectarian violence since the revolution to overthrow Assad. Government security forces retaliated after forces loyal to the Assad regime launched an attack in the coastal city of Latakia, Assad’s hometown. In total, around 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were massacred, according to the U.N. Most of the victims from the Alawites, a minority group in Syria, which the Assad family belonged to, as well as from the Druze community.</p><p>It was the worst episode of violence since the overthrow of Assad in December 2024.</p><p>Clashes between Bedouin tribes, Druze militias, and government forces in Suweida led to hundreds of deaths and drew in Israeli military intervention — to protect Syria's Druze minority. A ceasefire was eventually agreed to but the spiraling ethnic violence highlights Syria's rocky transition. </p><p>The country's dwindling Christian community has also felt the brunt of extremist violence. In June, the Islamic State was suspected of carrying out a deadly suicide bombing at a Greek Orthodox church in Syria, which killed 22 worshipers and injured 63 others. Christians have also been attacked and, in some cases, killed, allegedly by forces tied to the al-Sharaa government. </p><p>The new authorities will also have to incorporate Kurdish forces operating in Northeast Syria, where the Syrian Democratic Forces have been crucial to the U.S.-led counter-ISIS campaign. Any disruptions in the merging of the SDF into the Syrian state raises the risk of an ISIS resurgence.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Charlie Kirk assassination suspect remains in special housing unit despite completed mental evaluation</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> The Utah County Sheriff's Office said the suspect accused of assassinating Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk remains within a "special housing unit" of a jail, even though his mental evaluation has been completed.</p><p>Kirk was taken to a local hospital in critical condition following the shooting on Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, where he later died, officials said. Tyler Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder, two counts of obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, two counts of witness tampering and commission of a violent offense in the presence of a child.</p><p>Utah County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Ray Ormond told Fox News Digital on Tuesday that Robinson saw mental and medical staff at the jail, but will remain within the special housing unit.</p><p>"Robinson has been seen by our medical and mental health staff. Due to patient privacy regulations, I'm not able to [go] further into that," Ormond said. "Robinson will stay in our special housing unit for the time being."</p><p>When asked if Robinson will remain in the special housing unit indefinitely, Ormond said, "That's not set in stone and his housing location may change down the road."</p><p>Previously, the law enforcement agency said Robinson would remain on a special watch status in the Utah County Sheriff's Department special housing unit so staff could "keep an eye on him" until he cleared a mental health screening.</p><p>"Special watch" status is done for several reasons, including violent behavior, type of crime, suicidal comments and behavioral issues, the department said.</p><p>Previously, the department said it wasn't aware of Robinson making any suicidal comments.</p><p>Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Fox News Digital the mental health evaluation likely "suggests that he should not be housed with the general population," as Robinson remains within a "special housing unit."</p><p>"A full mental health evaluation will be conducted by his defense team to try to negotiate a plea deal to save his life, to put on an insanity or diminished capacity defense during the guilt phase, which is challenging under Utah law, or to put on evidence of mitigation during the death penalty phase," Rahmani said.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Antifa activist Gabriel Nadales praised President Donald Trump’s executive order designating Antifa a domestic terrorist organization, telling Fox News the step was long overdue.</p><p>"This is a long time coming, and I hope that Congress really follows suit and helps define what this means," Nadales said Tuesday on "Fox &amp; Friends First."</p><p>His appearance on the Fox News Channel came days after Trump signed an executive order with the formal designation, asserting that the left-wing activist group poses a direct threat to the U.S. government, law enforcement and rule of law.</p><p>Nadales, who has said he left Antifa as his political beliefs shifted, said Trump's order means that many of the "self-described" and "localized" groups under the Antifa umbrella could now be labeled domestic terrorist organizations.</p><p>"There's this idea that Antifa is merely an idea and, to an extent, that is true, but Antifa is a very collective or a specified set of ideas that believes in political violence to enact its own political goals. That is literally the definition of terrorism," he said.</p><p>"So if you call Antifa just an idea, it is literally the idea of terrorism itself."</p><p>Trump's order branded Antifa as a "militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States government, law enforcement authorities, and our system of law." </p><p>"It uses illegal means to organize and execute a campaign of violence and terrorism nationwide to accomplish these goals."</p><p>Antifa claims to be an "anti-fascist" movement that also opposes white supremacy and far-right extremism.</p><p>The group, however, has come under fire for wearing all black and concealing their identities and using tactics like doxxing, violence and intimidation.</p><p>Nadales said giving Antifa the "domestic terrorist" label could have two effects: first, helping law enforcement address what he called "terror cells," and second, launching a public-relations battle challenging the group’s identity as "anti-fascist."</p><p>"Antifa continues to claim itself as the anti-fascist, and [say], 'If you are against Antifa, you're pro-fascist,' but nothing can be further from the truth," he said. </p><p>"To combat Antifa is to combat political violence, no matter where it comes from, because, to a great extent, a lot of these Antifa activists, they are themselves the terrorists, they are themselves the fascists, so labeling them as domestic terror groups, it really helps in the battle against Antifa in the PR realm, because it really shows them for what they are. They are a domestic terrorist movement."</p><p><i>Fox News' Alexandra Koch and Sophia Compton contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Treasure hoard found near Jesus' Galilee site tied to forgotten Jewish uprising, archaeologists say</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Archaeologists in Israel recently found an ancient treasure hoard dating back more than 1,600 years – not far from where Jesus carried out much of His ministry.</p><p>The coins were found at Hukok, a kibbutz in northern Israel, according to the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA). Hukok is roughly three miles west of Capernaum, an ancient fishing town where Jesus preached and performed miracles.</p><p>Hukok and Capernaum are part of the Galilee region, which stretches from Israel's Jezreel Valley to the border of Lebanon.</p><p>The coins, however, were not contemporary to Jesus. The IAA said that they date back to the 4th century A.D., over 1,600 years ago.</p><p>They were left by Jews during the Gallus Revolt, the last Jewish uprising under Roman rule, between 351 and 352 AD.</p><p>The hoard consists of 22 bronze coins found "in a small crevice prepared deep in an underground hiding complex," the IAA noted.</p><p>IAA researcher Uri Berger said the hoard's location suggests it was "carefully planned its hiding place, [with its owners] hoping to return to it when the threatening troubles were over."</p><p>The coins were found in a pit at the end of a narrow, winding tunnel.</p><p>Interestingly, the hiding complex also dates back to earlier revolts, such as the Great Revolt in the first century A.D. and the Bar-Kochba Revolt, between 132 and 136 A.D.</p><p>"This shows that hundreds of years after these tunnels were dug out, they were reused," the IAA noted. </p><p>"The hoard provides, in all probability, unique evidence that this hiding complex was used in one way or another during another crisis – during the Gallus Revolt – a rebellion for which we have only scant historical evidence of its existence."</p><p>Researchers were "great[ly] surprised" by the discovery, which was found by volunteers excavating the complex for tourism development.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, it was the many volunteers excavating the hiding complex who actually uncovered this important treasure, and they enjoyed this great moment of the joy and excitement of discovery," the IAA's Einat Ambar-Armon said. </p><p>"The excavation thus became not only an important scientific event, but also a significant communal educational experience – one that brings the public closer to its heritage, and strengthens the sense of belonging and the connection to the past."</p><p>In a statement, IAA director Eli Escusido said he hopes the Hukok site will "be a magnet for tourists from Israel and the world."</p><p>He added, "We are working together so that the entire public can enjoy the hidden treasures of this site."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Princess Diana had an unexpected political ally during the public breakdown of her marriage.</p><p>Royal author Valentine Low has written a new book, "Power and the Palace," which details the relationship between the British royal family and the government over the years. </p><p>In the book, Low describes how former Prime Minister Sir John Major quietly served as a mediator between the "warring Waleses" while also being a "sympathetic listener to Diana at a time when she felt at her most alone."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Major, 82, for comment.</p><p>"People don’t realize this about John Major, but he … is a very warm, empathetic man," Low told Fox News Digital. "He did his best to talk to both Charles and Diana at that time. … He wasn’t going to try and bring them back together again, but he was trying to make sure that the whole crisis passed off without too much unnecessary drama, unnecessary unpleasantness, and that afterward, Diana would find some kind of role."</p><p>"I think it was very important in John Major’s eyes that Diana found a role after separating from Charles," Low added.</p><p>According to the book, Alex Allan, Major’s private secretary, said the prime minister had "a number of sessions with both Charles and Diana." When one royal had a meeting with him, the other would quickly ask if they could have a sit-down too. </p><p>Allan noted that while Major was not trying to stop the separation, he was "quite concerned" about Diana, in particular. Lord Butler, who was cabinet secretary at the time, felt that Major offered Diana "a shoulder to cry on."</p><p>"Diana tragically relied on numerous mystics, astrologers and spiritualists as she was so desperately lonely," royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams told Fox News Digital. "Major was soft-spoken and had a personable manner. His approach as broker endeared him to both Charles and Diana, winning the trust of the warring parties, in itself a monumental feat."</p><p>"Diana talked to people when she felt relaxed in their company," British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital. "I imagine Major offered Diana a safe space. However, he would have also been concerned about … Diana’s future position. He wanted to ensure a smooth separation process."</p><p>Diana’s private secretary, Patrick Jephson, told Low in his book that Major kept in regular contact with Diana, who yearned for a friend during a dark period in her life.</p><p>"Major would come and visit Diana quite frequently in the run-up to the separation and afterward," said Jephson. </p><p>"They would have tea, just the two of them. It was great, because always afterward, she was encouraged, she was buoyed up. She would refer to him fondly as ‘the Hon. John.’ … I got the very clear message that he enjoyed those meetings. He was there to be an honest broker, to be a source of practical help if she needed it, and to help her find happiness. Or at least contentment in what she was doing."</p><p>Low told Fox News Digital that Major has always been fiercely protective of his private conversations with Diana. Major never wanted to exploit Diana’s trust, Low pointed out.</p><p>"I’d like to say something about what John Major’s private conversations with Diana revealed, because I’m sure they revealed all sorts of absolutely fascinating things," said Low. "But John Major is one of the most discreet people known to man and has given away no details whatsoever about his conversations with any member of the royal family and never will."</p><p>Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital he believed that Major’s concerns for Diana were the real deal.</p><p>"I worked behind the scenes with the John Major government," he explained. </p><p>"I played a very small part in him becoming prime minister and then was asked to take his official inaugural photographs … The reality is, John Major understood loneliness. … When he saw the emotions in Diana, he reached out to help her. He saw it as his constitutional duty, but also, Major came from a middle-class background, unlike his contemporaries, who came from wealthy backgrounds."</p><p>"Diana was ‘The People’s Princess,’" Turner pointed out. "Major was very much a man for the people. So intuitively, he offered support. It was in his power to help, but also in his heart too."</p><p>Still, Fitzwilliams believed Major "undoubtedly misled Parliament" when he announced in 1992 that Charles and Diana had decided to separate but had "no plans to divorce." </p><p>"That was hardly practical," said Fitzwilliams.</p><p>For four more years, Charles and Diana continued to tear each other apart in public, Esquire reported. Each gave televised tell-alls about their crumbling union. In 1995, Diana famously sat down with the BBC’s "Panorama" and declared, "There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded." She was referring to her estranged husband's mistress and longtime love, Camilla Parker Bowles.</p><p>The outlet noted that this was the last straw for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, who were still hoping the pair could work out their differences. The queen finally allowed them to get an official divorce.</p><p>The divorce was finalized in 1996.</p><p>"Diana essentially reinvented herself," said Chard. "She recognized her superpower as ‘The People’s Princess’ and threw herself into charity work … and connecting with people. </p><p>"This led her to being known and loved as the ‘Queen of People’s Hearts.’ She felt free and independent away from the institution and realized how the media helped her tell her story and sway public opinion. She used the press strategically."</p><p>A former royal aide also told Low that Major did his best to make Prince William and Prince Harry feel they were cared for as their parents’ breakup played out on the world stage.</p><p>"He was an important, sympathetic, helpful mentoring figure," said the aide.</p><p>"He is a very genuine person, very natural," Sir Malcolm Rifkind said, as quoted in Low’s book. "He is a very warm but also very astute person. He is the sort of person that, if you did have something very personal that you wanted to discuss in private, you would feel comfortable doing that."</p><p>Diana’s claim of independence was brief. In 1997, the Princess of Wales died from injuries sustained in a Paris car crash. She was 36.</p><p>Major was in office from 1990 to 1997. Town &amp; Country reported that following Diana’s death, Major was appointed special guardian to her sons, a role suggested by Charles. This made Major responsible for the legal and administrative matters relating to the princes. </p><p>In 2005, the queen appointed Major a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. Then in 2012, he became chairman of the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust.</p><p>His relationship with the royal family remained close. Over the years, he appeared at events supporting the Trust, often alongside the queen or other members of the royal family, the outlet shared. </p><p>Major attended both Prince William’s wedding to Kate Middleton in 2011, and Prince Harry's marriage to Meghan Markle in 2018. He also attended the queen’s funeral in 2022 and the more private service afterward.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Pastors hail Erika Kirk’s forgiveness of husband's accused killer as powerful testimony to Christian faith</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Jesus Christ’s 2,000-year-old call to believers to love their enemies was vividly demonstrated Sunday when Erika Kirk publicly forgave her husband’s alleged killer before an audience of millions.</p><p>Charlie Kirk, 31, was gunned down Sept. 10 while speaking at a Utah campus. Prosecutors filed murder charges against suspect Tyler Robinson, who admitted to shooting Kirk in a text message to his roommate and transgender partner, saying that he "had enough of [Kirk's] hatred."</p><p>After losing her husband — and as some fringe figures celebrated his killing — Erika Kirk delivered a tearful message of forgiveness at his memorial service.</p><p>"My husband, Charlie. He wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life. On the cross, Our Savior said, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.' That young man… I forgive him," Kirk said. "I forgive him because it was what Christ did, and it's what Charlie would do."</p><p>"The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the Gospel is love — always love. Love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us," she continued.</p><p>Faith leaders across the country praised her words as one of the most powerful public acts of Christian witness in years.</p><p>Bishop Robert Barron, founder of Word on Fire Ministries and bishop of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota, attended the memorial. He called it "one of the most impressive and moving displays of the Gospel I have ever experienced."</p><p>"Jesus speaks of loving and forgiving our enemies, but this is one of the very hardest of his teachings to realize in practice. That Erika Kirk was able to pronounce a word of forgiveness to her husband’s assassin, even as her heart must have been breaking, was breathtaking," he told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Her remarks, broadcast to millions, were "extraordinarily significant," Barron added. "She became in that moment a brilliant evangelist, not so much through the intellectual articulation of the faith but the enactment of it."</p><p>The comments drove international headlines and praise from across the political spectrum.</p><p>Rev. Franklin Graham, president and CEO of Samaritan’s Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, said countless people around the world witnessed the power of God through Kirk's testimony.</p><p>"The world just witnessed something incredible. Erika Kirk — while grieving the death of her husband and the father of their two young children — forgave his killer. Erika did it so well, straight from her heart," Graham told Fox News Digital. "To forgive like this is very difficult to do. It is possible only through the grace of God."</p><p>Pastor Jack Hibbs of Calvary Chapel Chino Hills said her message showed that God’s grace is stronger than evil.</p><p>"When she said, ‘I forgive that young man,’ she could only do that from the strength of God because Erika knows what it’s like to be forgiven," Hibbs told Fox News Digital. "And by doing that, she set herself free from that man’s act of horrific violence… At the same time, she sends a message to this young man that her act of goodness and grace is greater and much more powerful than his act of evil."</p><p>The Christian leaders noted that Kirk's message and the peaceful mourning of believers stood in stark contrast to people online celebrating Kirk’s death.</p><p>"There was no bitterness. There were no protests, no hatred, no violence," Graham said. "There have been very few times when I have seen the name of Jesus Christ lifted up for the world to see quite like this, and I am grateful to Erika for showing millions of people around the world what it looks like to live — and forgive — like Christ."</p><p>Barron called the celebrations over Kirk's death evidence of "a deep rot in our culture" that Christians are meant to confront.</p><p>"Christians are called upon by Christ to be light in the darkness," he said. "They have to go into the dysfunctional parts of our culture and bring the spirit of Jesus. And so we reach out, especially to those in greatest moral peril, with love, forgiveness, and an invitation to repent."</p><p>Hibbs pointed to Jesus' warning to believers that the world would hate them, but said Christians have hope in the midst of hostility.</p><p>"And we are actually seeing that [play out today]," he said. "But the Christian rejoices. We know that heaven is for real and that this life is short. And so we want to make sure that others know that they too can be forgiven like we have been forgiven and that Christ died for that very reason. That's what the whole story of the Bible is about. And so we find great comfort even in the hostility. There's a message of comfort to us because we understand."</p><p>The Christian leaders were hopeful that Kirk's act of forgiveness would embolden Christians to fearlessly live out their faith and could spark revival worldwide.</p><p>"I believe there are many people harboring hatred and unforgiveness in their hearts today. It is my prayer that God will use Erika’s message and example to move people to forgive. This could result in countless changed lives across our nation and around the world," Graham said.</p><p>Christian singer Chris Tomlin, who led worship at the service, also said Kirk's words could plant the seeds for a spiritual awakening.</p><p>"That kind of forgiveness can only come from somebody who really walks with God," Tomlin told The Christian Post. "And for people to see that and witness that — what a moment around the world. I think so many people came to faith yesterday, thousands and thousands of people. And I pray it’s an awakening in this nation."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Are Trump and Rubio trying a version of trust but verify with Mexico?</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>"[T]here’s no other government," said the United States secretary of State, "that’s cooperating as much with us in the fight against crime as the Government of Mexico." Issued several days ago from the Palacio Nacional in Mexico City, with the uppermost tier of Mexico’s political elite beaming approvingly, it was a bold statement for Marco Rubio to make.  </p><p>It’s a big win for them, in their desperation to ward off what they see as a series of worst-case outcomes, among them tariffs, the end of United States–Mexico–Canada trade agreement (USMCA), American extraditions of their cartel-connected political class, and U.S. military strikes in their country. In this context, the praise from Rubio — perceived as a Latin America hawk in general — comes as a tremendous relief. They will, at minimum, wield it as validation the next time any other American suggests Mexico isn’t doing enough.  </p><p>From Mexico’s perspective, it is nearly a get-out-of-jail-free card. The question is what, exactly, it means.  </p><p>To borrow a phrase, Rubio’s affirmation is "big, if true." It is so big, in fact, that it begs a great many questions — none of them answered or answerable in the public sphere. As longtime observers of Mexican affairs know, exemplary cooperation with the United States has not been a hallmark of Mexican governance for well over a decade now.  </p><p>What used to be an exceptionally close security relationship was first dented under the Mexican presidency of Enrique Peña Nieto, from 2012-2018, and then almost totally severed under his successor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, from 2018-2024. Peña Nieto presided over a political structure shot through with corruption, and Lopez Obrador, himself, reportedly has had a long relationship with the Sinaloa Cartel for at least the past 20 years.  </p><p>All this combined to produce a Mexican state that was an antagonist, not a partner, to the United States — a narco-state in all but name, and moreover an active ally of hemispheric dictatorships including the ones in Cuba and Venezuela.  </p><p>The present administration of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Lopez Obrador’s handpicked successor, has labored to present a different image, if not necessarily a different reality, for American consumption. Threatened early by the Trump administration with American military action against its allied cartels, Sheinbaum’s regime did several things that the Mexican state could have done all along, including closing the border and extraditing narcos by the dozen.  </p><p>All these measures are necessary, from the American perspective — and also tactical at best. What it has never done, as far as we know, is address the strategic problem undergirding all the rest: the longstanding collusion between the regime and its criminal cartels. </p><p>That collusion is neither minor nor the mere background noise of Mexican civics. It is rather fundamental to the MORENA regime — the political party of both Lopez Obrador and Sheinbaum — and has been essential to the consolidation of its power. Nearly unnoticed in American policy discourse, that regime has been busily transforming Mexican society into an autocratic left-populist state akin to that which unfolded to disastrous effect in Venezuela.  </p><p>In this framework, cartel money and guns have been essential in delivering elections, curbing independent public life and enriching key powerholders, by which the coalition holds together. It is an open secret in today’s Mexico that though Sheinbaum herself is likely not corrupt — she is that most fleeting phenomenon in Latin America, the pure ideologue — her regime is stacked with those who are. There are recipients of cartel funds in Mexico’s Senate, Congress, governorships and beyond. </p><p>These men and women are the fulcrum, the essential link, between Mexico’s state and its cartels, and until they are dealt with, any arrangement with Mexico — no matter how quiet the border is, and no matter how many narcos are sent north — is temporary. The problem is unsolved so long as the state-cartel alliance remains in effect.  </p><p>This is also precisely the class of culpable figures that Sheinbaum has left untouched, and unworried by anything like justice. Absent that action, it is quite difficult to say that "there is no other government that is cooperating as much with [America] against criminality than the Mexican government." Yet Secretary Rubio did say that, and so we return to the original question: why? </p><p>We must be open to three major possibilities.  </p><p>One is that the United States is treading the well-worn pathway of showering the Mexicans with unearned praise, in the hopes of appealing to their better natures. This is a dreary norm in our communications with them — which never yields the hoped-for outcomes — and we should be open to the possibility that more of the same is at work here.  </p><p>Another possibility is that the current level of cooperation, such as it is, is deemed sufficient by the United States, and we are content with leaving Mexico’s fundamental strategic problem unaddressed. This would be a tremendous error — a worse crisis is therefore an inevitability — but there is a constituency for it within the American bureaucracy. </p><p>The final possibility, and the one for which we hope, is that the secretary of State is dead-on right — and there is much more underway behind the scenes than we know. Perhaps real action against Mexico’s narco-state apparatus is forthcoming, and both the Americans and President Sheinbaum are in on it.  </p><p>We can hope for it, and we do, but at some point, we have to know. Inside Mexico policy circles, a conversational commonplace is that we won’t know until 2028 or so, at the opening of Sheinbaum’s second half of her six-year term — not at all coincidentally, right at the point at which the accountability brought by the Trump administration will be in its final months. If this is the case, it isn’t enough. </p><p>What Americans need, in validation of the secretary of State’s rhetoric, is a visible signal now. Sheinbaum, if she is a good-faith partner, need not risk her regime or her life with an immediate assault on her cartel-partner regime elements — but she can affirm the analysis, and the principles of action that come from it. She can recognize reality and say so. She is fond of proclaiming her dedication to Mexico’s soberania — its sovereignty — and now she has the opportunity to declare that soberania includes sovereignty from the cartels, its agents and its partners … no matter how high up in government they go.  </p><p>We on the American side need it. We want to trust — but we must verify.  </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump, Bessent can leverage TikTok negotiations to counter China's rare earth dominance</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and Commerce Minister Li Chenggang in Madrid last week. They announced a "framework agreement" over TikTok, the Chinese-owned app used by millions of Americans. </p><p>But the story isn’t only about TikTok. It’s also about how America uses TikTok as a lever – and why that lever is more necessary than ever.</p><p>TikTok is an important issue in and of itself: control over data, algorithmic influence, foreign ownership – all of which are critical for national security. In addition, however, TikTok is a tool the U.S. can and should use in ongoing trade engagement, as well as to counter China’s growing leverage in rare earths, critical minerals and semiconductors.</p><p>When I served in President Donald Trump’s first administration ("Trump 45"), the core issues we confronted included a massive trade imbalance, intellectual property theft, cyber-theft and China’s Belt and Road infrastructure expansion. These were predatory practices in trade, tech and finance. Today, in "Trump 47," the battlefront has broadened – but one thing that hasn’t changed is the psychological warfare the Chinese employ any time negotiations are underway.</p><p>I was at the center of one of the most dramatic examples of this during Trump 45… </p><p>After an exhausting month of prep work, I boarded my flight to Beijing in March 2018 with wary optimism. I had worked intensively leading up to this trip, drafting a comprehensive framework document outlining a new trade deal with China, a proposal that would overhaul virtually every aspect of the U.S.-China economic relationship.</p><p>We’d sent the proposal to our Chinese counterparts several days earlier, and now our high-level trade delegation was en route to Beijing to negotiate the largest change to trade relations in at least 10 years. The cast of characters illustrates just how significant this trade deal could be. It included Secretary Steven Mnuchin (head of the delegation), Under Secretary David Malpass and me (Treasury), Secretary Wilbur Ross (Commerce), U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and several of his deputies, NEC Director Larry Kudlow, Under Secretary Ted McKinney (Agriculture), and Peter Navarro (special assistant to the president and director of trade and manufacturing policy).</p><p>We arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing with about an hour to review our plans one more time before we had to depart for Diaoyutai – the state guest house where Mao and every leader since has entertained foreign dignitaries. But there was a surprise waiting for us at our embassy:a brand-new proposal, drafted by the Chinese, which they were putting forth at the eleventh hour, and which we had never seen. It was about 15 pages long – and completely in Chinese!</p><p>I was one of the few people in the room who could read it. After a quick scan, I told the group: "This is wholly unacceptable. This document doesn’t say anything – they’re just messing with us." A heated debate ensued over how to respond, and how the Chinese were likely to react. But there was no time to reach a consensus; it was time to leave for Diaoyutai.</p><p>There was a mass exit from the secure room where we met at the embassy, and, almost like a well-choreographed ballet with a hundred moving parts, we all shuffled to our designated cars. As Secretary Mnuchin stepped into the limousine to take us to the meeting, Malpass insisted that I ride with the secretary and pushed me into the seat next to Mnuchin, saying, "We need to know exactly what this says – can you translate it on the way?"</p><p>As we sped through the streets of Beijing, I sat in the back seat, literally shvitzing as a technical term in Chinese got the better of me, and furiously translated as I read out loud, in English, what the Chinese had dropped in our laps.</p><p>Even as we climbed the stairs into the building and entered the meeting room, none of us was quite sure how Mnuchin was going to handle this hot potato. After Vice Premier Liu He’s flowing stream of diplomatic pleasantries welcoming us to China, the secretary calmly stated in response, "We received your draft. Thanks for sending it over – but we’re going to use our draft for today." It wasn’t the preamble they expected. But it was entirely consistent with the new tone that President Trump had set from the day he took office.</p><p>Today, China has moved from using tariffs and IP theft to controlling choke points – especially in rare earth elements, critical minerals, semiconductors and advanced manufacturing capacity. The numbers are clear indicators of China’s leverage. </p><p>China accounts for about 70 % of global rare earth mining and about 90 % of the world’s rare earth refining and separation capacity. In 2023, China controlled 61 % of global mining of rare earth magnet elements and 92 % of refining capacity for those magnets. </p><p>On semiconductors: while U.S. companies remain strong in chip design and advanced R&amp;D, China’s share of the semiconductor industry’s value-added has surged (from about 8 % in 2001 to over 30 % by 2016), and China is pushing aggressively to become self-sufficient in mature node production.</p><p>These are not passive metrics. They are active levers China already uses in the trade negotiations through export restrictions, licensing controls or by threatening disruptions. For example, in April 2025 China – clearly in response to President Trump’s bold tariff moves – added export licenses and restrictions for seven heavy rare earth elements, including dysprosium, terbium, samarium, plus rare earth magnets—materials critical to EV motors, wind turbines, electronics and defense systems.</p><p>The challenges faced in Trump’s first term have only evolved – not eased. The trade deficit is large, IP and tech theft are growing more dangerous, predatory development finance practices continue and China’s leverage in rare earths, semiconductors and control over supply chains threatens global development and American autonomy.</p><p>TikTok is a headline issue impacting critical issues of data, influence and national security. But it is also an essential lever to counter the new pressure points China is pressing. Madrid and Friday’s Trump–Xi call offer a chance to reshape this broader contest. </p><p>As I demonstrate in "A Seat at the Table," President Trump’s strategy and policies during his first administration allowed us to exert maximum pressure on our counterparts and to stay the course with firm negotiating positions and clear red lines. Last week’s dialogues demonstrate that Trump will continue to insist on substance over symbolism, an approach critical to our national interest. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Democrats target vulnerable House Republicans as they slam Trump's 'attacks on free speech'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>- The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Wednesday launched a new digital ad campaign spotlighting what it calls President Donald Trump's "ongoing attacks on free speech" following last week's suspension of comedian Jimmy Kimmel from his late-night TV perch.</p><p>The spots, which will target a handful of House Republicans in swing districts who face challenging re-elections in next year's midterms, will run on conservative and independent media, including the podcasts of media superstars Joe Rogan and Ben Shapiro, who are very popular among younger and male audiences.</p><p>The campaign, shared first with Fox News Digital, comes in the wake of ABC's move last week to pull Kimmel's late-night talk show off the air after his remarks about the alleged assassin of Charlie Kirk sparked outrage and a veiled threat from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).</p><p>The suspension of Kimmel sparked outrage among Democrats and progressives, and even some high-profile conservatives, who said the late-night host was being punished for exercising freedom of speech. Many Republicans countered that Kimmel's comments suggesting Kirk's suspected killer was a MAGA member were outrageous and false. </p><p>ABC reinstated Kimmel on Monday and his program returned to air Tuesday night, although the roughly 60 affiliated stations owned by Nextar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group preempted the program.</p><p>"The American people don't support attacks on free speech, which is why Trump is losing support among independent and conservative voters," the DNC argued in a statement. "The Republican base is fracturing, with Republican figures including Megyn Kelly, Ted Cruz, and Ben Shapiro loudly breaking with the administration."</p><p>The DNC ad includes a clip of Trump, during the first week of his second administration, announcing that "on day one I signed an executive order to stop all government censorship."</p><p>The narrator in the spot later charged that "Trump wants to control what you see so he can control what you think." </p><p>The DNC says the campaign, which is backed by a modest five figures, will target the congressional districts of Republican Reps. Rob Wittman of Virginia, Jen Kiggans of Virginia, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, and Tom Kean Jr. of New Jersey.</p><p>"It’s clear Donald Trump only cares about silencing his critics — and now, voters across the country and in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey are going to hear about it," the DNC claimed.</p><p>Trump and many of his top allies, long advocates of free speech, have criticized people who have been critical of Kirk since the conservative activist's assassination earlier this month.</p><p>The president welcomed ABC's decision to initially pull Kimmel off the air indefinitely. And Trump also suggested axing the broadcast licenses of networks who, in his opinion, treat him too negatively.</p><p>DNC Chair Ken Martin, in a statement to Fox News, said, "Donald Trump’s administration has amassed a chilling record of restricting speech, extorting private companies, and dropping the full weight of the government censorship hammer on Americans simply exercising their First Amendment rights. This is no exaggeration, and it’s splintering the coalition that got Trump elected."</p><p>Martin claimed that Trump is "attempting to silence people. It’s un-American, and Democrats won’t stand for it."</p><p>Republicans and conservatives,during the administrations of Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden railed against what they considered were efforts to muzzle free speech, attacking Democrats for pushing "cancel culture."</p><p>Trump and his allies are now defending their latest actions by saying that "consequence culture" is replacing "cancel culture."</p><p><i>Fox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Russian aircraft invaded two NATO members in two weeks. What are we going to do about it?</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Russian fighter jets recently entered Estonian airspace – a bold incursion that came just nine days after 19 Russian drones swarmed the airspace of fellow NATO member Poland. While the Kremlin has denied any intentional violations of NATO airspace, the evidence suggests that both actions were almost certainly deliberate. </p><p>These provocations appear to have been designed to test NATO for both operational and political weakness, and to tell the world that Vladimir Putin believes he can behave with impunity in Ukraine and beyond. Indeed, all of Putin’s recent feints toward peace have been belied by his actions: He followed up his Alaska summit with President Trump in Alaska with the largest aerial attacks on Ukraine of the past year, and ignored the ceasefire deadline offered by the president. </p><p>As NATO continues its deliberations on a coordinated response to the Polish incident and now Estonia, a unified, decisive and robust rebuke from the entire alliance is of paramount importance. The Western alliance failed to deter Russia in 2014, and again in 2022; with Putin now taking the fight even further into European territory, we cannot afford to show any weakness. </p><p>The U.S. and our European allies must show Putin that his acts of aggression will not stand, and that for every escalation and provocation, the costs to him will only multiply. </p><p>NATO is already taking action to strengthen the defense of its eastern flank – a salutary measure, but just one piece of the puzzle. The proposed withdrawal of U.S. military support in the Baltics would send a disastrous signal to the Kremlin, particularly given the incursion into Estonian airspace. </p><p>Congress and the administration should work together to ensure that the U.S. military presence in the frontline Baltic states remains in place as a key component of NATO’s defensive architecture. America and our allies in Europe should take additional steps to bolster the defensive capabilities of NATO’s eastern frontier, forge ahead with iron-clad security guarantees to Ukraine, and provide Kyiv with the defensive and offensive weapons it needs to put Russia on the back foot. </p><p>We also need to make it clear that Russia has torpedoed any prospects for peace talks for the foreseeable future. President Donald Trump has made a good faith effort to facilitate negotiations, but Putin has made it eminently clear that he has no interest in peace. Continuing to indulge the fiction that he wants what we want – or worse, that there is any kind of equivalence between Russia as the belligerent party, and Ukraine, the victim of Russian aggression – only buys Putin time and leverage. </p><p>Next, as President Trump has made clear, Europe needs to stop buying Russian oil and gas – now. It’s absurd that after more than three years, some European countries are continuing to supply Russia with the revenue it needs to conduct this brutal war on their own continent. What’s more, with President Trump leading America back to energy dominance, Europe will have alternative suppliers to turn to – avoiding price hikes while cutting off precious funding for Putin’s war effort. </p><p>The president is also correct to push for a coordinated campaign of financial pressure on Russia and its enablers. This should include sanctioning the Chinese banks that keep the Kremlin’s war machine moving, imposing crushing tariffs and secondary sanctions on the countries that are keeping the Kremlin afloat through oil, gas, and uranium purchases. Congress should work to pass the bipartisan bill put forward by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., which includes the measures outlined above as well as expanded restrictions on Russian financial entities and transactions and the Russian energy sector. </p><p>President Trump understands that peace can only be secured through strength. It’s why he pushed for Europe to assume greater responsibility for its own security in both his first and second administrations. As the former secretary of state, I know from experience that this insistence wasn’t always welcome – but as we all know, it turned out to be prescient. The president’s willingness to have those difficult conversations with our European allies has resulted in the landmark commitment of 5% GDP defense spending for NATO members – putting the alliance back on track to reestablish deterrence and restore Europe’s territorial integrity. </p><p>America must see that project through. It is critical to Europe’s security, and to America’s core interests, that we get this right – and that can only be done by imposing serious costs on Russia, and by showing Putin that his provocations have only strengthened the NATO alliance. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">As Trump gives DOJ marching orders, a clear double standard emerges</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Trump just fired a top federal prosecutor because he failed to bring charges against two despised opponents, New York Attorney General Letitia James and ex-FBI chief James Comey.</p><p>The ouster of Erik Siebert, U.S. attorney for Virginia’s Eastern District — and Trump’s own appointee — came after he couldn’t find sufficient evidence to charge James with mortgage fraud.</p><p>The president blamed the firing on Siebert having been put forward by two Democratic senators – hardly a secret – under the archaic "blue slip" requirement that should be abolished.</p><p>"Yeah, I want him out," Trump said after ABC broke the story. Tish James is "very guilty of something."</p><p>What’s more, "he didn’t quit, I fired him!"</p><p>It’s a blip of a story, compared to Trump and his team naming a special prosecutor to again investigate Russiagate allegations from 2016; dropping corruption charges against New York’s Mayor Eric Adams, and suspending security clearances for the law firm that Robert Mueller left four years ago (later blocked by a judge).</p><p>The larger point is that perhaps we’ve become inured to the serious spectacle of a president not just interfering with the Justice Department but literally dictating who should be charged and who should be protected.</p><p>Trump told Pam Bondi over the weekend, "They impeached me twice, and indicted me (five times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!" </p><p>He said he believes James, Comey and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff are "all guilty as hell" but that nothing is being done.</p><p>As someone who used to roam the halls of the Justice Department — and covered three independent counsels involving Ronald Reagan’s AG, Ed Meese — I am acutely aware of the ethical boundaries. </p><p>After the Watergate scandal, which included Attorney General John Mitchell going to prison, led to reforms, the idea of a wall between the White House and DOJ was further cemented. </p><p>Joe Biden saw any involvement in criminal probes as radioactive, and no evidence of his tampering has surfaced (though he did pardon a bunch of allies, including his son).</p><p>There was a huge uproar back when Bill Clinton had a chance tarmac meeting with his AG, Loretta Lynch, while his wife was under investigation over her private email server. She said they talked about grandchildren and travel. A CBS reporter called the meeting "absolutely shocking." </p><p>But you don’t have to rely on unnamed sources to learn about Trump giving his attorney general marching orders. He broadcasts it, even boasts about it.</p><p>Of course, Trump stretching his executive powers goes well beyond DOJ. There are his funding freezes against universities, dispatching of the National Guard in D.C. and elsewhere, and attempting to fire members of supposedly independent agencies such as the Federal Reserve.</p><p>The escalation against the media has been nothing short of stunning. Trump cheered ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel against the backdrop of FCC Chairman Brendan Carr threatening to take action against its local licenses. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," he said, prompting some conservatives to say he sounded like a mafioso.</p><p>Trump won a $16 million settlement from ABC over George Stephanopoulos saying Trump had been held liable for "rape," not sexual abuse. He also won $16 million from CBS over the biased editing of a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris. </p><p>It just so happens that Nexstar, which preempted Kimmel and owns many CBS affiliates, needs administration approval to take over Tegna, another media conglomerate.</p><p>Trump filed suit against the Wall Street Journal for reporting he’d sent a birthday message to Jeffrey Epstein with a silhouette of a naked woman–and when that surfaced with what closely resembled his signature, continued to deny he had done it.</p><p>And then there is his $15 billion suit against the New York Times, which a judge threw out after just four days for its "inexcusable" breaking of the rules in a filing filled with "vituperation." It’s a strange suit because it wasn’t triggered by any particular story, just a general charge that the Times campaign coverage was illegal, including a Harris endorsement that ran on the front page.</p><p>Even the largest corporations have to spend big bucks to defend such suits, which is sort of the point.</p><p>But nothing is as sensitive and powerful as law enforcement, whose officials can shield allies and prosecute opponents.</p><p>The president’s position is that DOJ was weaponized against him during the Biden administration, and therefore he’s entitled to payback.</p><p>The latest news just broke. The Justice Department was investigating border czar Tom Homan for allegedly offering to help win federal contracts to businessmen — who were actually undercover FBI agents — in exchange for $50,000.</p><p>But as MSNBC reports, Trump’s DOJ dropped the case after he took office.Since the hidden-camera encounter took place before Trump was elected, when Homan was a private citizen, I could argue he was just doing what hundreds of lobbyists do. Except for one nagging detail — Homan took the 50K in cash, in a Cava fast-food bag. No paper trail.</p><p>And yet Pam Bondi’s department gave him a pass.</p><p>Prosecutors in every administration must make difficult judgment calls about whether they have enough evidence to convict, especially against government officials or high-profile figures. </p><p>And next time there’s a Democrat in the White House, what’s to stop that person from playing the same kind of hardball, saying their party was entitled to payback? The cycles could be endless.</p><p>As for now, it would be easier to have confidence in these prosecution decisions if the president wasn’t openly calling the shots. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Jimmy Kimmel in late-night return slams FCC chair for free speech pivot</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>After a nearly weeklong suspension from ABC, Jimmy Kimmel returned to the air Tuesday with a 30-minute monologue addressing the controversial comments that led to his ouster and accusing the Trump administration of hypocrisy on free speech.</p><p>The late-night host questioned whether it was acceptable for the government to regulate "which podcasts the cellphone companies and Wi-Fi providers are allowed to let you download to make sure they serve the public interest."</p><p>Kimmel said such an idea would have been unfathomable in the United States – a land that prides itself on its long tradition of free speech – even just 10 years ago. </p><p>He took particular aim at FCC Chairman Brendan Carr over comments Carr made last week during an interview on the conservative podcast "The Benny Show," hosted by Benny Johnson.</p><p>Carr told Johnson there were potential "avenues" the FCC could take against ABC and Disney after Kimmel suggested that Trump supporters were "desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them." </p><p>Carr alleged that Kimmel was part of a "concerted effort" to mislead the public about the political leanings of Kirk’s suspected assassin, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who FBI officials and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said held a "leftist ideology."</p><p>Carr said broadcasters, whose licenses are granted by the FCC, have an "obligation to operate in the public interest." </p><p>"Look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or, you know, there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead," Carr said. </p><p>Kimmel said Carr telling an American company this would amount to a "direct violation of the First Amendment [and] is not a particularly intelligent threat to make in public." </p><p>"The FCC has a long tradition of meddling where they shouldn’t under many administrations. But it wasn’t always like this," Kimmel said. </p><p>He also highlighted a 2022 tweet from Carr himself, posted while serving as an FCC commissioner under the Biden administration, that read: "Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while using humor to draw more people into the discussion. That’s why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship."</p><p>Kimmel revealed that the commissioner who wrote that tweet was none other than Carr. </p><p>In his monologue, Kimmel clarified that it had not been his intention to "make light" of Kirk’s assassination earlier this month. </p><p>"I don’t think there’s anything funny about it," Kimmel said, choking up. "Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what … was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make." </p><p>Kimmel conceded that his remarks last week may have "felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both." </p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to the FCC for comment. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump slammed ABC and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel in a Truth Social post Tuesday night, questioning the network’s decision-making after it opted to keep Kimmel on the air.</p><p>"I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back," Trump wrote. "The White House was told by ABC that his show was canceled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent’ was never there."</p><p>Kimmel’s attempt to criticize reactions to Charlie Kirk’s assassination triggered his suspension. Even after ABC/Disney executives reinstated the show with statements emphasizing sensitivity, major affiliates such as Nexstar and Sinclair announced they would not air the program unless their demands were met.</p><p>"Sinclair also calls upon Mr. Kimmel to issue a direct apology to the Kirk family. Furthermore, we ask Mr. Kimmel to make a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk family and Turning Point USA," Sinclair Broadcast Group, which is aligned with many conservative broadcasters, said in a statement.</p><p>Kimmel’s comments framed the reaction from conservatives and the MAGA movement as an effort to distance themselves from the accused shooter while also leveraging the killing for political gain.</p><p>Trump said the comedian "puts the network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE."</p><p>He also suggested that ABC’s support amounted to "a major illegal campaign contribution" to Democrats.</p><p>"Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 million," Trump said.

<div class="article-title">Jimmy Kimmel chokes up as he explains Kirk comments, says he 'never' intended to mock assassination</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>"Jimmy Kimmel Live!" host Jimmy Kimmel insisted that he never intended to make light of Charlie Kirk's assassination in comments that led to his show's suspension.</p><p>Tuesday night was the first show Kimmel hosted since Disney announced its return on Monday after nearly a week off the air.</p><p>Kimmel came out to a standing ovation which continued into chants of "Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!" and ongoing cheering.</p><p>"If you are just joining us, we are preempting your regularly scheduled encore episode of 'Celebrity Family Feud,' we’re bringing you this special report," Kimmel opened. "I’m happy to be here with you tonight." </p><p>He went on to thank his fellow late-night talk show hosts, including Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart and David Letterman, along with right-leaning critics like Clay Travis and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for showing some support for him during his suspension.</p><p>Kimmel then addressed, though did not apologize for, the comments that originally got him suspended.</p><p>"I’ve been hearing a lot about what I need to say and do tonight, and the truth is, I don’t think what I have to say is going to make much of a difference," Kimmel said. "If you like me, you like me. If you don’t, you don’t. I have no illusions about changing anyone’s mind. But I want to make something clear, because it’s important to me as a human, and that is – you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man."</p><p>Kimmel began tearing up as he said he posted a message to Instagram sending love to Kirk's family the day of his death.</p><p>"Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions," he continued. "It was a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make, but I understand that, to some, it felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both, and for those who think I did point a finger, I get why you’re upset. If the situation was reversed, there’s a good chance I would have felt the same way." </p><p>Kimmel added, "I have many friends and family members on the other side who I love and remain close to, even though we don’t agree on politics at all. I don’t think the murderer who shot Charlie Kirk represents anyone. This was a sick person who believed violence was a solution, and it isn’t ever."</p><p>Kimmel also gave his mixed thoughts on Disney suspending his show after 23 years on the air.</p><p>"Every night, they defended my right to poke fun at our leaders and to advocate for subjects that I think are important by allowing me to use their platform, and I'm very grateful for that. With that said, I was not happy when they pulled me off the air on Wednesday," Kimmel said.</p><p>He added, "I did not agree with that decision and I told them that, and we had many conversations. I shared my point of view, they shared theirs. We talked it through. And at the end, even though they didn’t have to, they really didn’t have to, this is a giant company, we have short attention spans, and I am a tiny part of the Disney corporation, they welcomed me back on the air."</p><p>Kimmel closed his monologue by tearfully recounting Erica Kirk's speech at her husband's funeral where she showed forgiveness to his assassin.</p><p>"There was a moment over the weekend, a very beautiful moment. I don’t know if you saw this. On Sunday, Erika Kirk forgave the man who shot her husband. She forgave him. That is an example we should follow. If you believe in the teachings of Jesus, as I do, there it was. That’s it. A selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow. It touched me deeply, and I hope it touches many, and if there’s anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, I hope it can be that," Kimmel said.</p><p>Kimmel’s show was suspended by Disney last Wednesday after he said right-wing commentators were "desperately" trying to characterize Kirk’s alleged assassin as someone who wasn’t "MAGA."</p><p>"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it," Kimmel said on Sept. 15.</p><p>Broadcasting companies Sinclair Broadcasting Group and Nexstar Media Group announced after the episode aired that they would be preempting the show across dozens of ABC affiliates because of Kimmel’s "ill-timed and insensitive" comments. </p><p>Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr also made a veiled threat against the show following backlash from the comments.</p><p>Sinclair and Nexstar preempted Kimmel’s show again Tuesday night and have said they will keep doing so as discussions with ABC continue behind the scenes.</p><p>Ahead of Kimmel's return, President Donald Trump attacked both Kimmel and ABC for bringing the show back despite being told that it was "canceled."</p><p>"I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent’ was never there. Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who’s not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE," Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p><p>He continued, "He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers!

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva has won a special election in battleground Arizona, securing the congressional seat left vacant by her father’s death and further eroding Republicans’ razor-thin House majority.</p><p>The Associated Press reports that Grijalva, a former Pima County supervisor, defeated business owner and contractor Daniel Butierez, the Republican nominee, in Tuesday's election in southern Arizona's 7th Congressional District.</p><p>Grijalva will serve the remaining 15 months of the term of Raul Grijalva, who died in March following complications from cancer treatment.</p><p>The younger Grijalva's victory was anything but a surprise in the left-leaning district. Democrats enjoy a nearly two-to-one voter registration advantage over Republicans in the Hispanic-majority district, which stretches from Yuma to Tucson and includes almost the entire length of the state's border with Mexico.</p><p>Once Grijalva is seated, Republicans will control the House 219-214, with two vacant seats remaining. </p><p>There's a vacancy in Texas 18th Congressional District, a heavily Democrat-dominated district in Houston, following the March death of Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner. The special election to fill the seat will be held on November 4, which is Election Day 2025.</p><p>And Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, a right-leaning seat where Republican Rep. Mark Green stepped down in July to take a job in the private sector, is also currently vacant. The special election to fill the seat will be held on December 2.</p><p>Grijalva, thanks in part to her family name and her support from national progressive rock stars, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, grabbed over 60% of the primary vote this summer in a five-candidate showdown.</p><p>Progressive activist and social media influencer Deja Foxx came in a distant second.</p><p>Grijalva, who with her victory became Arizona's first Latina in Congress, targeted President Donald Trump as she campaigned,</p><p>"In Congress, I commit to fight Trump’s cruel agenda, like the Big Ugly Bill that took away coverage from nearly 383,000 Arizonans and 142,000 children," Grijalva pledged in a social media post, as she took aim at Trump, congressional Republicans, and their sweeping domestic policy measure that they named the One Big Beautiful Bill.</p><p>Grijalva had also said that if she won, she would immediately sign a discharge petition by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky. The petition, which is currently just one vote shy of passing, calls on the GOP-controlled House to vote to urge the Justice Department to release the files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>Butierez, as he campaigned, had been promoting himself as the change candidate in a district controlled by Democrats since the seat was created over two decades ago.</p><p>"This is your chance to actually get a Representative who will represent everyone. If you vote we win, if you don't only the radicals will have representation," he wrote on X.</p><p>Butierez, who as the 2024 GOP congressional nominee lost to the elder Grijalva while Trump narrowly carried the southwestern battleground state at the top of the ballot, easily won this summer's Republican primary in the special election.</p><p>While Trump carried Arizona last year after losing it in 2020, 2024 Democratic presidential nominee and then-Vice President Kamala Harris won the district by 23 points. </p><p>Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin, in a statement after the race was called, said that "Rep.-elect Grijalva won a hard-fought race. Now, Arizonans will have a fighter in their corner who will stand up to Trump on behalf of families who want to see real leadership in Washington."</p></body></div></body></html>

The lede of the now-scrubbed article added, "In a surprise verdict, a federal jury acquitted Ryan Routh of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate last year. The screenshot also indicated that the article would be published in the print edition on September 24, 2025. </p><p>Podcast host and Fox News contributor Mary Katharine Ham posted the screenshot and wrote, "Just searched Ryan Routh's name @nytimes and got this result in the first head and subhead. I get it y'all have some kind of prewrite, but why is it preloaded? Routh was just convicted on all charges.

The lede reads, "A federal jury convicted Ryan Routh, an itinerant building contractor, of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate last September."</p><p>In a statement to Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for The New York Times said, "Ahead of some newsworthy events like courtroom verdicts, The Times and many other news organizations make preparations for different possible outcomes. An earlier version of this article was published inadvertently with a pre-written version of a not guilty verdict; it was replaced with the correct version less than a minute later, and a correction was added to explain what happened. As the current version makes clear, Mr. Routh was found guilty on all five counts against him."</p><p>In the interest of being current, there have been numerous high-profile cases where outlets got the outcome of major stories wrong.

Routh faced five federal counts, including attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer, and multiple firearms offenses. The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.  </p><p>After the verdict was read, Routh reportedly tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen before four U.S. Marshals restrained him.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A scary scene unfolded at Progressive Field during the Cleveland Guardians-Detroit Tigers game Tuesday night, when the Guardians’ David Fry was hit in the face by a foul tip on a bunt attempt. </p><p>In the bottom of the sixth inning with the Guardians down 2-1, there were runners on the corners with no outs when Tarik Skubal delivered a 2-1 pitch to Fry, who quickly turned to square for a sacrifice bunt. </p><p>But the 99 mph fastball from Skubal, the Tigers' Ace, was too far inside.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris called out The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times in her new book, "107 Days," over their refusal to endorse a presidential candidate in 2024. </p><p>"The Los Angeles Times, my hometown newspaper, published its electoral endorsements," she wrote, recalling the Oct. 14 piece published by the paper. "The very first line of the article stated: ‘It’s no exaggeration to say this may be the most consequential election in a generation.’ But there was no mention of the most consequential race of all."</p><p>The LA Times, owned by Patrick Soon-Shiong, declined to endorse a presidential candidate, and The Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, followed suit. </p><p>"The pre-capitulation of these powerful billionaires alarmed and dispirited me. As it turned out, they were early adopters of the feckless posture that would be embraced by a raft of business leaders and institutions once Trump was elected. They’d just been the first in line to grovel," Harris wrote after noting the Post's non-endorsement and in reference to President Donald Trump's eventual election victory. </p><p>Harris's new book was released on Tuesday and recounts her historically short presidential campaign that followed former President Joe Biden's decision to exit the race.</p><p>The LA Times announced in late October the editorial board wouldn’t be endorsing a candidate for the first time since 2008. As a result, the paper’s editorials editor, Mariel Garza, resigned over what she alleges was the owner's decision not to endorse Harris. </p><p>The LA Times told Fox News Digital "an endorsement by the Los Angeles Times is an important decision that can influence a large number of voters. After thoughtful consideration, the owner, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, could not endorse Vice President Harris, based on the record of the Biden administration and her own track record. Competence matters!"</p><p>The Post announced days later that the editorial board would not be endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 election or any future presidential election.</p><p>William Lewis, publisher and CEO of The Washington Post, called the decision at the time "a statement in support of our readers’ ability to make up their own minds on this, the most consequential of American decisions — whom to vote for as the next president."</p><p>The paper has only endorsed Democratic presidential candidates, except in 1988 when it declined to endorse Democrat Michael Dukakis.</p><p>The Washington Post did not immediately return a request for comment.</p><p>USA Today and The Minnesota Star Tribune also declined to endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 election.</p><p>Harris quoted former Washington Post editor Marty Baron's reaction to the paper's non-endorsement in her book, writing, "This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty. Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage."</p><p>Harris also highlighted Alexandra Petri, who now writes for The Atlantic but previously served as a political humor columnist at the Post.</p><p>"But if I were the paper, I would be a little embarrassed that it has fallen to me, the humor columnist, to make our presidential endorsement. I will spare you the suspense: I am endorsing Kamala Harris for president, because I like elections and want to keep having them," Petri wrote at the time.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Chicago Cubs third baseman Matt Shaw is "not concerned at all" about any backlash he could get after skipping a game to attend Charlie Kirk’s memorial in Arizona. </p><p>Shaw missed the Cubs’ 1-0 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday to attend the memorial service in Glendale, though manager Craig Counsell mentioned to the media that Shaw wasn’t available for the game because he was at a funeral for a friend. </p><p>Shaw explained why he made it a point to attend the memorial despite his team’s schedule.</p><p>"My connection with Charlie was through our [Christian] faith," Shaw said before the Cubs opened a new series with the New York Mets Tuesday, per the Chicago Sun-Times. "And that’s something that drives me every day, the reason why I’m able to do what I do every day, and that’s something I’m extremely thankful for. </p><p>"I know without my faith and without the many blessings I’ve been given in my life, that I wouldn’t be here, be able to talk to you guys, able to help this team eventually go and win championships.</p><p>"That’s something I feel really, really blessed about, so whatever backlash comes is OK. I feel strong about my faith and that what was meant to be happened."</p><p>Shaw added that he and Kirk became friends last offseason as they lived in the same apartment complex in Arizona. The two stayed in contact throughout the MLB season, Shaw said. </p><p>Shaw said he was emotional when he found out Kirk was assassinated while at a speaking event at Utah Valley University Sept. 10. </p><p>"When that happened, a lot of emotions came over me," he explained. "I didn’t foresee that happening. I don’t know how to describe everything that happened, how I was feeling, But I will say I was tearing up pretty good. I had a lot of [teammates] supporting me, and that will be something I’ll remember for my entire life."</p><p>Shaw had been scratched from the Cubs’ lineup that night before a game against the Atlanta Braves. </p><p>Kirk, a native of Arlington Heights, a northern suburb of Chicago, was "one of the biggest Cubs fans I ever Met," according to Shaw. In fact, Shaw said it was Erika Kirk, his widow, who asked him to attend the memorial. After a conversation with Counsell and some teammates, Shaw felt his decision to attend was accepted. </p><p>"The reason Charlie and I connected so close was because of our faith," Shaw added. "That’s something that drives me every single day, something that I think about all the time. So, if people are wondering who I am and what I stand for, I’d say that my faith and the many blessings I’ve been given are why I’m able to be here, and I just want to make sure that I can give that back to people, that I can support people around me, that I can love people around me the same way that I’ve been blessed."</p><p>The Cubs were among the MLB teams to pay tribute to Kirk, calling for an end to "all political violence." </p><p>The flag at Wrigley Field was flown at half-staff in accordance with MLB’s request that teams follow President Donald Trump’s presidential proclamation honoring Kirk.</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Comedian Guy Branum claimed he was left with bruises after an alleged altercation with a fellow passenger during a recent flight on Delta Air Lines.</p><p>On Sept. 14, the 49-year-old actor shared a video on Instagram in which he said he was sitting in the middle seat when a man sat down next to him and complained about not having enough space. Branum alleged the man then elbowed him and told him that he was "too fat" to fly.</p><p>"I had an exciting adventure on my plane flight today," the "No Strings Attached" actor began his video, which he labeled "Flying While Fat."</p><p>"Normally when I [have] more money, I'll fly business class because I'm a big guy and I don't want to be in anybody else's space," he continued. "And this time, I got a Comfort Plus ticket." According to Delta’s website, Comfort+ seats are the same width as standard economy but provide more legroom.</p><p>Branum said he often worried about flying since he has had "people freak out at me before."</p><p>"And today, it was a middle seat, not great," he said. "A guy came down, a White man in his sixties.</p><p>"And first, he freaked out at a woman because she was putting something in the overhead compartment near his seat," Branum continued. "Then he sat down next to me, and he immediately was just p----- off at me and asked me if I could move over. And I was like, 'No, I can't.' Then he just elbowed me as hard as he could."</p><p>In the video, Branum displayed an image of bruises on his side that he allegedly sustained after the incident. </p><p>"And then I took this video," he said as the clip cut to another video in which he was seen seated on the plane next to the man.</p><p>"Elbowed me because he believes that I'm too fat to be sitting next to him," Branum claimed to the camera as the man remarked, "Well, who wouldn't believe that?" </p><p>"Would you be happy if I elbowed you back?" Branum asked the man.</p><p>"Well, there's not a lot of room here for me," the man replied. "I paid for this seat too."</p><p>"I paid for this seat as well," Branum pointed out. </p><p>"Think you'd want to at least share the armrest?" the man asked. Branum responded, "Yes, we're not sharing the armrest right now. Right now, you are using the armrest because you elbowed me to get out."</p><p>"I'm not even on the armrest," the man said before Branum told him, "I'm not on the armrest either."</p><p>The two continued to argue as the man appeared to imply that Branum should lose weight. After Branum told the man, "You are hardly svelte yourself," the man said he was a member of WeightWatchers."</p><p>"And that is how I lost the weight," the man told him. </p><p>Branum then asked the man if he expected him to lose weight in the "next 20 minutes or so."</p><p>"No, have you ever," the man said as Branum interjected, "Do you think I have ever tried to lose weight, Sir?" </p><p>"I don't know," the man said.</p><p>"Do you really think that I'm a fat person in this country, and I've never tried to lose weight?" Branum asked.</p><p>"I don't know," the man repeated. </p><p>"OK," Branum said. </p><p>The video cut to Branum as he addressed the camera, explaining that he told a flight attendant that the man had "hit" him but "I was OK to stay in the seat if necessary." </p><p>Branum claimed the man complained to the airline staff that he was "too fat." </p><p>The comedian said multiple Delta staffers came to observe "if I was too fat," including a senior crew member who told the man that Branum would not be removed. Eventually, the man switched seats with a woman across the aisle, and Delta offered her frequent flyer miles for the inconvenience. Branum said he also requested miles.</p><p>Branum noted that the woman who eventually sat next to him was "so nice." However, he went on to say that "fat people shouldn't be waiting for some future moment when we'll be worthy of traveling and living our lives." </p><p>The Emmy Award winner alleged a staff member asked him to delete his video, but he refused. He said other passengers then backed him up, telling staff the man had been difficult with others on the flight.</p><p>He said the woman who eventually sat beside him was "so nice," but added that "fat people shouldn’t be waiting for some future moment when we’ll be worthy of traveling and living our lives."</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Delta Air Lines for comment.</p><p>In an interview with TMZ on Saturday, Branum said he plans to file a police report and a civil lawsuit against the man. "You can’t hit somebody because you think they’re fat," he told the outlet.</p><p>Branum also alleged that the man was not removed from the flight because of his status as a frequent flyer. He told TMZ he has been in contact with Delta representatives about the issue.</p><p>Fox News Digital has also reached out to representatives for Branum for comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former San Jose State University women's volleyball assistant coach Melissa Batie-Smoose has filed a lawsuit against the Board of Trustees of the California State University (CSU) system. SJSU is one of 23 California-based schools that are part of the CSU system. </p><p>Batie-Smoose's contract was not renewed when it expired in February, after being suspended from the team in the middle of the season for filing a Title IX complaint over the program's handling of a transgender athlete on its team and a female player who objected to the trans athlete. </p><p>Now, Batie-Smoose is alleging wrongful termination, claiming she "suffered and continues to suffer lost wages, loss of professional reputation and opportunity, emotional distress, and other damages." </p><p>"Defendant’s actions were willful, intentional, and/or taken with reckless disregard for Plaintiff’s federally protected rights," the lawsuit states. </p><p>"Other coaches who did not oppose the inclusion of a biological male on the women’s volleyball team or who did not advocate for the rights of female athletes, were not subjected to suspension, termination or any discriminatory actions as was Plaintiff." </p><p>A spokesperson from San Jose State University responded to the lawsuit. </p><p>"We are aware of the filing and have no further comment, due to pending litigation," the spokesperson told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Batie-Smoose's Title IX complaint against the school, which she filed at the end of last October, first brought to light allegations that the transgender athlete, Blaire Fleming, conspired with an opposing player to have teammate Brooke Slusser spiked in the face during a game. </p><p>Slusser previously joined a lawsuit against the NCAA and filed another against the Mountain West Conference, citing her experience of being made to share changing spaces and hotel rooms with Fleming without being told Fleming's birth sex. </p><p>Batie-Smoose was then suspended at the start of November, while the allegations against Fleming prompted an investigation by the Mountain West into the situation. </p><p>The Mountain West's investigation determined that sufficient evidence could not be found, however, Fox News Digital later reported that the law firm hired to conduct the investigation, Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher (WFG), is the same firm that is representing the Mountain West against Slusser's lawsuit, which also contain the allegations against Fleming of conspiring to have Slusser harmed, as seen in public records obtained by Fox News Digital.</p><p>Slusser also previously told Fox News Digital that she had a conversation with a teammate who was interviewed as part of WFG's investigation. </p><p>"Based on what I was told, exactly what one of my teammates had seen go on that night — about talking about the scouting report and leaving the net open — was told to those lawyers. So, that should have been sufficient evidence [of the alleged plan by Fleming]," Slusser told Fox News Digital, adding she wants to see the investigation reopened. </p><p>"People are telling you this happened, and it's not second-hand information. She sat there and heard the conversation between Blaire and [former Colorado State volleyball player] Malaya [Jones]. So, to me, just from what I know without even having to dig deep into this investigation, there is sufficient evidence, and they were told sufficient evidence."</p><p>Fox News Digital cannot independently verify that Slusser’s teammate corroborated the allegations against Fleming when speaking to investigators. </p><p>WFG later deleted a Nov. 27 online press release from its website that announced the legal victory to keep Fleming eligible. The page is still viewable via an online archive. Fox News Digital has asked WFG multiple times why the page was deleted but has not gotten a response. </p><p>Meanwhile, Batie-Smoose previously told Fox News Digital what she recalled during the Oct. 3 game against Colorado State in which Fleming was accused of conspiring with opposing player Malaya Jones to have Slusser spiked in the face. </p><p>"Close to the end of that set was when [Fleming] overpassed a serve right on top of the net for Malayla to hit toward Brooke Slusser, and then those two were kind of always doing eye contact and making smirks up to that point. But then, when that happened, they both laughed, and [Fleming] said, ‘Thank you,’ and that's when Blaire blew her a kiss," Batie-Smoose alleged.</p><p>Weeks after her contract was not renewed in February, Batie-Smoose's home in Scotts Valley, California, was vandalized in a shooting.</p><p>Scotts Valley Police Department Captain Scott Garner previously told Fox News Digital that officers determined that the weapon used was a pellet gun, and was investigated as an act of vandalism. The pellet had been recovered by police. Nobody was harmed and no suspect or motive was determined. </p><p>Batie-Smoose said she previously received hostile emails about her stance on Fleming and trans inclusion in women's sports. She also claimed to have had in-person altercations with individuals in Santa Cruz and Scotts Valley who disagreed with her stance. </p><p>"People recognize me in the community and I'm in an area that's speaking out and speaking to fight for women's sports, I'm in an area with some crazies and I definitely believe it was a target on me for speaking out," she said.</p><p>Meanwhile, SJSU is under an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for its handling of the situation involving Fleming and Slusser. </p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump crackdown highlights judge vacancy crisis pushing D.C. courts to brink</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington — </em>The Trump administration has touted its crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., in recent weeks, with increased arrest numbers and reduced violent crime. But the surge of resources to the nation's capital hasn't extended to its courts, which have been hampered by judicial vacancies that have led to a backlog of cases and slowed the administration of justice.</p><p>The crisis in the district's courts has persisted for years due to a high volume of open seats for judges. But whether, and when, it subsides rests with the president and Senate under the structure established by Congress more than 50 years ago. </p><p>Today, there are 13 vacancies on the D.C Superior Court, the district's trial court, and another two judges are on extended medical leave. By January, another two sitting judges are set to retire, which would leave 15 of the Superior Court's 62 seats unfilled.</p><p>On the D.C. Court of Appeals, two of its nine seats are open. One of those has been empty since November 2013, and neither have nominees awaiting approval by the Senate.</p><p>"With vacancy rates nearing 25% on the trial court, we are set up to fail those who are depending on us for fair and timely legal outcomes," said Douglas Buchanan, spokesman for the D.C. Courts. "Now, in today's reality, our ability to operate is simply not sustainable. It's the case today, and it only stands to grow worse for those we serve."</p>
<h2>"A lot of different gears"</h2>
<p>The vacancy crisis underscores the unique position the district holds as the nation's capital. While judges are elected by voters or appointed by governors in other jurisdictions, the president nominates and the Senate confirms judges to the local courts in D.C., just like they do for federal courts.</p><p>It's a process that Congress itself created under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973. The law established a seven-member Judicial Nomination Commission, which submits a list of three candidates to fill each vacancy on the Superior Court and Appeals Court. The president then selects a person from that list to nominate for Senate confirmation.</p><p>"That requires a lot of different gears to all mesh up together when the District of Columbia doesn't even have a single senator in that room to say, 'Hey, this is important to the district,'" said Joe Musso, president of the Trial Lawyers Association of Washington, D.C.</p><p>In recent years, presidents have <span class="link">prioritized confirmations</span> to the federal courts, with Mr. Trump and President Joe Biden <span class="link">appointing more than 230 federal judges</span>. But filling the vacancies on the D.C. courts has not been as important.</p>
<p>In December, the Senate had a chance to approve 10 of Biden's picks to the local courts, but the nominees were blocked. Mr. Trump can now fill those seats with his own nominees.</p><p>For its part, the Judicial Nomination Commission has submitted to the president a list of candidates for every existing vacancy on the Superior Court and Appeals Court. </p><p>Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has made four nominations to the D.C. Superior Court, and one is poised for a vote by the full Senate after advancing out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in July. Two of the president's four nominees are for vacancies that have existed since 2020.</p><p>"President Trump has been focused on filling vacancies in Superior Court and I strongly agree," Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said in a statement to CBS News. "Not having enough judges is not only bad for the District, the prosecutors, and the attorneys, it's bad for those individuals who are awaiting a trial that will impact their civil liberties."</p><p>While the Senate Judiciary Committee oversees nominations to the federal courts, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee handles confirmation hearings for picks to the D.C. courts. </p><p>A spokesman for Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, told CBS News that the panel is processing the three other nominations "according to our standing rules and procedures and will announce a hearing at the appropriate time."</p><p>Still, it's unclear whether there is broad appetite in the Senate to move the president's picks for the D.C. courts, particularly as lawmakers face a fast-approaching Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government and are under pressure to approve a backlog of Mr. Trump's executive branch nominees.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, cases filed in the Superior Court continue to stack up. In the criminal division, trials for people accused of the most serious felony offenses are being scheduled into late 2027 and early 2028, Buchanan said.</p><p>"This is not fair to the victims of these very serious crimes, nor to the defendants who stand accused and in custody while they await their day in court," he said.</p><h2>An "urgent" crisis</h2>
<p>Mr. Trump's crackdown on D.C. came in response to what he claimed is rampant crime that has made the nation's capital a dangerous place to live and visit, despite data showing that crime had been falling in recent years. Last month, the president <span class="link">deployed the National Guard</span> to the district and placed the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control for 30 days, authority granted to him under the Home Rule Act.</p><p>While the 30-day takeover of the local police department <span class="link">expired on Sept. 10</span>, National Guard troops will <span class="link">remain on district streets</span> through November. Muriel Bowser, the mayor of D.C., has said local police will continue close coordination with federal law enforcement indefinitely. </p><p>As part of Mr. Trump's plans to address what he says is a "crime emergency" in the capital, the president signed an executive order last month that calls on prosecutors to pursue federal charges and <span class="link">pretrial detention</span> for people arrested in the district.</p><p>But government lawyers with the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C, led by Pirro, have <span class="link">struggled to secure indictments</span> in a string of recent cases. In at least one of those, involving a now-fired <span class="link">Justice Department employee</span> accused of <span class="link">throwing a sandwich</span> at a federal officer, prosecutors filed a misdemeanor charge, which doesn't require a grand jury indictment.</p><p>Pirro's office also prosecutes felony offenses and most misdemeanors committed by adults in the local trial court. From January through March, the most recent data publicly available, there was a slight uptick in felony prosecutions and cases charged in the Superior Court compared to the first three months of 2024.</p>
<p>But the president's efforts to tamp down on crime and the alleged perpetrators are meeting a court system that has for years lacked a full complement of judges to hear and adjudicate cases.</p><p>"You're looking at criminal defendants who are sitting in jail on nothing more than a charge, and they're presumed innocent under the Constitution," Musso said.</p><p>The ballooning number of cases filed in the Superior Court began years before Mr. Trump's crackdown. From 2021 to 2024, the trial court saw an 83% increase in new case filings, data shows. For 2025, the Superior Court is on track to either meet or exceed the 56,627 new cases from last year.</p><p>For the criminal division, there were nearly 40% more felony cases filed between 2022 and 2023, and roughly 51% more misdemeanor cases brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office, according to data from the court.</p><p>In a branch of the Civil Division that handles most civil disputes, the number of cases on judges' calendars has nearly doubled to roughly 500.</p><p>"This is urgent," said Tianna Gibbs, a law professor at American University in Washington who studies access to justice issues. "We have a lot on the line: the administration of justice, access to justice and public confidence in the courts as a forum that can fairly and efficiently resolve their disputes."</p><p>Meg McKinney, a family law attorney who practices in D.C., said the high number of vacancies is a problem across the Superior Court, but she believes the impact is more acutely felt in the Criminal and Family Court Operations divisions.</p>
<p>"You're already dealing with families who have a fair amount of crisis or dysfunction, and they're basically just twisting in the wind while they make their way through the court system," she said.</p><p>In the family court, there were between four and six vacancies throughout 2024, and a 46% spike in new or reopened cases from 2020 to 2024, according to an annual report to Congress submitted in March. In its Domestic Relations Branch, which processes cases for divorce, custody and adoptions, among other areas, initial hearings are taking place before a magistrate judge to help ensure families can get into court quickly. </p><p>But even for the small number of cases that go to trial, it can take more than a year to get a trial date, and securing consecutive days on the calendar is difficult. The wait for an actual decision may be even longer, since the time available for judges to write opinions is sparse.</p><h2>"It feels like D.C. has been forgotten"</h2>
<p>Mr. Trump has heralded the operation in D.C. as a success, and <span class="link">crime in the district has dropped</span> significantly since he deployed National Guard troops and other federal law enforcement officers to the district. But local officials have urged the president and the federal government to assist D.C. in other ways.</p><p>"We have 15 vacancies in the Superior Court, which we need to go down to the Congress for approval. We have two vacancies in the Court of Appeals which we need to go down," Bowser, the mayor, told MSNBC in an interview last month. "So anytime you have a backlog in the courts you have delayed justice and people are less safe."</p><p>Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who represents D.C. in the House as a nonvoting delegate, warned last month that the D.C. courts are facing a "perpetual vacancy crisis" because of Senate inaction. She said the number of open seats on the Superior Court is "significantly impeding D.C.'s ability to try criminal cases in court, harming public safety and access to justice."</p><p>Norton introduced legislation in July that would give the D.C. Council authority over the jurisdiction and organization of the local courts. She has also proposed plans that would allow judicial nominees to the D.C. courts to be appointed without approval by the Senate after a 30-day congressional review period.</p>
<p>But D.C. officials have been sounding the alarm about the vacancy crisis for years, though their appeals for help have gone unanswered. Letters sent from members of the D.C. Council, legal organizations and even sitting D.C. judges have not moved the White House or Senate to action.</p><p>"It feels like a problem where the grievance is not going to get to the person who has control of moving the levers in the process," said Gibbs, the American University law professor. "It feels like D.C. has been forgotten in this way and there's no way to appeal to the powers that be to address the problem."</p><p>Lawyers in the district pin the blame on its lack of representation in the Senate, which has left residents without a voice to pressure senators to act.</p><p>"No other jurisdiction has to go through all the hoops to get the courthouse filled with reasonable arbiters of the facts and the law," Musso said. "And when it does, it has to appeal to a Senate that has no representation."</p><p>Some senators in neighboring states have taken up the cause. In the last Congress, Sen. Tom Carper, a Democrat from Delaware, and senators from Virginia and Maryland introduced legislation that would streamline the nomination and confirmation process for D.C. judicial picks. But the Senate didn't act on the plan, and Carper retired last year.</p><p>Carper told CBS News in an interview before his term ended that "the way we treat the District of Columbia, especially with respect to selection of the judges, is, I think, shameful."</p><p>"We basically say, you know, 'You can come up with all the names within the district of who you think ought to be a judge, and we'll take our good old time to figure out if we're ever going to confirm some of these judges,'" Carper said.</p>
<p>That approach by the Senate has led to concerns that its delays in confirming D.C. judicial nominees is damaging the public's trust in the judicial system.</p><p>"The issue is that there's just this divide where the people who do have control over the process don't understand the impact that the delay in confirmations is having on D.C. families. And then the D.C. families don't understand how the process is working," Gibbs said. "In their eyes, the delay is the problem of the court. Families begin to view the court as a broken system that doesn't meet the commitment that it has to the public, which is to administer justice in a way that is efficient, that is fair, that allows families to have the opportunity to be heard before the court."</p><p>The Republican-controlled House has begun to take legislative steps related to the D.C. courts, and it has moved swiftly to exert its control over the district. GOP Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas introduced legislation earlier this month that would dismantle the D.C. Judicial Nomination Commission, and the House approved it in a party-line vote last week. It's unclear whether it would garner the 60 votes needed in the Senate to advance.</p><p>In a letter to Congress, the members of the commission said D.C.'s judicial nomination process is "one of the best nonpartisan processes" in the nation and noted that Mr. Trump engaged in it during his first term and earlier this month with his nominations.</p><p>"The Commission process has been effective for over 50 years, working with both Republican and Democratic administrations," members wrote in a Sept. 9 letter. "Our process is carefully designed to ensure that the over 700,000 residents of our city have a voice in judicial appointments, while also respecting the President's authority in nominating individuals for the critical role of judicial service in the District of Columbia."</p><p>But allies of Mr. Trump and The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, have denounced the seven-member commission as composed of "leftists" and said the judicial appointment scheme, which was codified by Congress in 1973, is questionable under the Constitution. Members of the panel are appointed by the president, mayor, D.C. Council, D.C. Bar and the chief judge of the U.S. district court in the district.</p><p>The member tapped by the chief judge in D.C. is <span class="link">Judge Tanya Chutkan</span>, who presided over the <span class="link">criminal case against the president</span> brought by then-special counsel Jack Smith involving his alleged attempt to hold onto power after the 2020 election. The <span class="link">charges were dropped</span> in November after Mr. Trump won the election.</p>
<p>While the House moved swiftly on Sessions' plan for the nomination commission, there's been no action on Norton's proposal related to the D.C. courts, and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has not scheduled hearings for Mr. Trump's nominees.</p><p>For stakeholders who have watched the vacancies in the D.C. courts languish for years, successfully securing an appointment to the D.C. courts appears to be a daunting task, requiring cooperation between three different bodies: the Judicial Nomination Commission, the president and the Senate.</p><p>But Musso said the consequences of continued inaction are severe.</p><p>"When you're waiting years for justice, those years are filled with angst and difficulty and stress that you would otherwise not have but for these delays," he said. "Real people are involved here. Real human beings need our justice system."</p>

<section class="content__body">
<p>Super Typhoon Ragasa pummeled Hong Kong on Wednesday morning with a ferocity not witnessed in the city for years. Ragasa brought hurricane-force winds, torrential rain and a storm surge that left a trail of destruction in densely populated Hong Kong.</p><p>A river of sea water crashed through the lobby of a luxury hotel, sending people and glass flying.</p><p>In neighboring Taiwan, Ragasa had already brought rains heavy enough to breach a dam, unleashing a wall of water that killed 14 people downstream and washed away a bridge.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people had to be evacuated from low lying areas in southern China as what's been dubbed by local media the "King of Storms" lashed the coastline.</p><p>A weather station in the town of Chuandao recorded a gust of about 150 mph on Wednesday afternoon, according to The Associated Press, setting a local record.

<p>We thought we'd passed the worst of the storm — high tide had come and gone — but then suddenly the huge surge of water rose toward us, with waves crashing into our front yard. In some areas the waves were higher than lamp posts.</p>
<p>The flooding trapped me and my children for a while, but we were lucky, managing to weather the storm and, thanks to piles of sandbags, keep our home dry.</p><p>Not everyone in the city of some 7.5 million people was as fortunate to walk away unscathed.</p><p>Super Typhoon Ragasa was heading toward southern China's Guandong Province on Wednesday, where almost 2 million people had been relocated to higher ground.</p>

<div class="article-title">Author of bestseller on opioids in Appalachia helps women fight addiction</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Pennington Gap, Va.</em> — On a Saturday evening in June, people of this rural region gathered at the historic Lee Theatre to celebrate the founding of Higher Ground Women's Recovery Residence.</p><p><span class="link">Author Barbara Kingsolver</span> opened the facility in January with royalties from her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, "Demon Copperhead," whose plot revolves around Appalachia's opioid crisis. The home offers a supportive place for people to stay while learning to live without drugs. Kingsolver had asked the women now living there to join her on stage.</p><p>Kingsolver, who grew up in Appalachia, suggested the women share with the audience what they were most proud of having gained from their first weeks at Higher Ground. But she learned they were more eager to brag on one another.</p><p>Supporters say Higher Ground provides stability and a reentry point after leaving jail, prison, or a treatment center. It offers a range of services and support in an area devastated by addiction to painkilling pills and other types of opioids. Most fundamentally, it's a true home, with one- and two-person bedrooms, a communal kitchen, and a den. Residents say they have found affirmation from a cohort of women who understand how addiction can demoralize a person and estrange them from family and community.</p>
<p>Ronda Morgan, a resident, said her family has always been in her corner. But while she was serving a jail sentence for drug possession, she told herself, "I'm sick of them having to do time with me." She was ready for recovery. Her daughter, who's a nurse, told her about Higher Ground, the first facility of its kind in sprawling, rural Lee County. Morgan learned she could live there for up to two years to gain the footing that had eluded her in three-plus decades of addiction.</p>
<p>What she didn't anticipate was the kinship she forged with her housemates — among them, Syara Parsell — and with Higher Ground's staff.</p><p>Parsell, 35, one of Higher Ground's first residents, said that in her time there she's received help finding employment and enrolling in community college courses.</p><p>From the staff and Kingsolver, Parsell said, she has received judgment-free support. "Together," she said, "we figure it out."</p>
<p>Traditional treatment facilities typically operate under highly structured medical supervision. Recovery houses, like Higher Ground, offer a more relaxed environment, helping move a resident "toward being an independent, fully functional, self-reliant human being," said Marvin Ventrell, CEO of the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers.</p>
<p>"Recovery occurs in the community," he said. But reentry must be approached delicately. "When addiction occurs with a human being, it also occurs within a family social structure." If a person in early recovery returns to a family that's unprepared, that person's chances of success "are severely diminished."</p><p>For Kingsolver, the opioid crisis became a focal point for what she hoped would be "the great Appalachian novel." The epidemic "has changed so much of the texture of this place," devastating families and communities.</p><p><span class="link">Pharmaceutical companies</span> targeted central Appalachia for sales of what they falsely claimed were addiction-resistant prescription opioids. Kingsolver wanted to "cast my net back over all of the extractive industries that have come to this place, taken out what was good, and left behind a mess."</p><p>"The way I put it is, 'They came to harvest our pain when there was nothing else left,'" she said.</p><p>In research for "Demon Copperhead," she immersed herself in the stories of people who've navigated addiction and those who care and advocate for them.</p><p>The novel has been an enormous success, having sold more than 3 million copies and earning far more than her previous works. Kingsolver decided to dedicate hundreds of thousands of dollars to address the crisis that has overwhelmed the region where she was raised — and to which she returned full-time in 2004.</p>
<p>Again, she set about listening. Drawing on a wide range of expertise, she determined that a women's recovery home was the wisest investment.</p>
<p>Joie Cantrell works as a public health nurse in harm reduction for the Virginia Department of Health, supporting policies and practices to curb the negative effects of drug use, and serves as Higher Ground's board chair. She had long recognized the need for just such a home.</p><p>"That was the part that was missing," Cantrell said. Too often, when someone would come out of a treatment facility or incarceration, "we lost them. They fell back into the same old patterns." She said the region sorely needed a safe, stable environment where women could recalibrate.</p><p>By August, the home reached its capacity of seven women. It's right in town, "which is so important," Kingsolver said, "because in this part of the country we have no public transportation."</p><p>Parsell has long suffered from social anxieties; drugs were her escape. Here, her housemates embraced her. They've offered the support she'd never experienced.</p><p>"Every two seconds, someone's like, 'Syara's here!'" she said. "I'm very grateful for it." If there's an issue in the house, "one of the seven of us has the solution."</p><p>Four residents are employed outside the home, one is enrolled in community college classes, one is completing her GED with plans to continue her education, and everyone volunteers in the community. Crafting classes are offered. Family members visit.</p><p>"They're living life," said Subrenda Huff, who was filling in while director Liz Brooks took maternity leave.</p>
<p>Morgan said she accomplished more in a month at Higher Ground than she had in years. That includes applying for identification documents, taking budgeting classes, and seeking permanent housing. It includes sharing upkeep duties in the house.</p>
<p>Such was Kingsolver's vision. But, she said, "here's what I didn't expect: The community embraced this with loving arms. I thought maybe people would say, 'I don't want this in my backyard.'"</p><p>Most of the furniture was donated. Kingsolver's quarter-million or so social media followers have been instrumental in that. "But it's not just book clubs in Switzerland or in California; it's people in Pennington Gap," she said. Church groups have donated "quilts, bedside lamps, things to hang on the walls just to make it homey."</p><p>Before the facility opened, local folks volunteered to pull weeds, take down an old fence, and put up a new one. Kingsolver said the well of support "has been just endless. It's been deep, and loving, and a wonder to see."</p><p>Higher Ground, with only one paid staff member, has estimated yearly operating costs of $120,000, Cantrell said. Residents are charged $50 a week. Ventrell said that fees at other recovery houses vary widely but that $2,500 a month is an approximate average.</p><p>"We want them to focus on saving money and paying any restitution or fines they may have from past charges," Cantrell said. "Some may be focused on repaying child support they may owe."</p><p>Higher Ground receives no federal or state <span class="link">funding</span>. Donations continue to pour in. And Kingsolver recently bought the building next door with plans to open a thrift shop, which would be a source of additional income for the home and offer retail work experience for its residents.</p><p>Supporters aspire to open more Higher Ground homes elsewhere in the region.</p>
<p>What these women are gaining, Kingsolver said, "is not just sobriety, but belief in themselves."</p><p><em>KFF Health News</em><em> is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at </em><em>KFF</em><em> — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Mexican national, former DACA recipient dies in ICE custody after arrest in August</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A Mexican national and former DACA recipient died in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Sunday, according to federal authorities. </p><p>Ismael Ayala-Uribe, 39, was arrested by ICE agents on Aug. 17 during an enforcement operation, said a news release from ICE. He was transferred to the Adelanto ICE Processing Center on Aug. 22 for immigration proceedings.</p><p>While detained, agents say that Ayala was evaluated by an on-call medical provider on Sept. 18. He was provided medication, according to ICE, and returned to his dormitory before he was later referred to the hospital on Saturday for further evaluation of an abscess on his buttock. </p><p>Ayala was scheduled for surgery and was "hypertensive and displayed normal tachycardia," the release said. At around 1:50 a.m., hospital staff declared Ayala unresponsive, and less than an hour later, he was pronounced dead despite attempted lifesaving measures, according to ICE.</p><p>While speaking with CBS News, Ayala's mother said that he died after suffering cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>"Saturday was the last time I visited him," Lucia Ayala told CBS News in Spanish. "He looked very pale and his hands appeared red." </p>
<p>The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department is also investigating the manner and cause of death, they told CBS News Los Angeles.</p><p>Ayala's family said that he was in good health when he was transferred to Adelanto. They told Ayala to receive medical care, as they could see he was sick when they visited him every Saturday after he was detained in Fountain Valley, an Orange County suburb. He allegedly told them that he wasn't provided medical care by facility officials. </p><p>He is the 14th detainee to die in ICE custody since President Trump took office in January, and the first-known death in California's immigration detention centers.</p>
<p>In a statement, ICE stated that emergency care is not denied for detainees in custody. </p><p>"ICE remains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments," said the statement. "Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay."</p><p>ICE said it notified the Department of Homeland Security and the Consulate of Mexico of the death, among other government agencies. </p><p>In June, Democratic members of Congress toured the Adelanto detention facility amid reports of deteriorating conditions, lack of access to food, water, and medication. Rep. Luz Rivas of California was among the group and in a statement said "the conditions we saw inside the Adelanto ICE Detention Center prove that Donald Trump's policies are putting our most vulnerable in harm's way."</p><p>In an emotional interview, Ayala says her son was loved by his family, friends and his long-time car wash clients. </p><p>The Mexican national worked at a car wash in the Los Angeles area for over 15 years, but was detained by federal agents on Aug. 17 during an immigration enforcement operation. Ayala-Uribe was transferred to Adelanto. </p><p>The Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, <span class="link">or DACA</span>, is the federal program that allowed undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to live and work in the country without fear of deportation.</p>
<p>Ayala-Uribe was brought to the U.S. at the age of four and became a DACA recipient in 2012. In 2016, his DACA renewal was denied. Ayala-Uribe was convicted of his first DUI in 2015 and sentenced to three years probation, according to ICE. He was convicted of his second DUI in 2019 and sentenced to 120 days in jail and five years of probation. </p><p>Ayala-Uribe's detention occurred as car wash locations have become targets for the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration in L.A. According to the executive director of the Clean Carwash Worker Center, at least 247 carwash workers were detained from June to September in the L.A. area, with 81 car wash businesses raided. </p>

<div class="article-title">Jimmy Kimmel delivers first monologue since show was taken off the air</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Jimmy Kimmel <span class="link">returned to his</span> long-running late-night show Tuesday, less than a week after network broadcaster ABC pulled "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" over remarks he made about <span class="link">the assassination</span> of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. </p><p>"It's been overwhelming...I've heard from all the people in the world over the last six days," Kimmel joked to open his monologue, going on to thank all those who came out in his defense, including conservatives. </p><p>"Most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway," Kimmel said. "I never would have imagined that Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, even my old pal Ted Cruz, who believe it or not said something very beautiful on my behalf. It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration. They did and they deserve credit for it."</p><p>The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, had announced Monday that Kimmel would return to the air. </p><p>It followed a political and media firestorm that began after the comedian addressed Kirk's slaying in a Sept. 15 monologue, saying: "We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it."</p>
<p>An emotional Kimmel on Tuesday said that "it's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it," noting that he had taken to social media following Kirk's killing to send his condolences to Kirk's family. </p><p>Kimmel didn't issue a blanket apology for his monologue remarks last week, but said he understood how it was offensive to some. </p><p>"Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual," Kimmel said of the suspected gunman. "That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make. But I understand that to some, that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both. And for those who think I did, point a finger, I get why you're upset. If the situation was reversed, there's a good chance I'd have felt the same way."</p><p>Kimmel gave a brief explanation for what took place behind the scenes between himself and ABC's brass.</p>
<p>"I was not happy when they pulled me off the air on Wednesday," Kimmel said. "I did not agree with that decision, and I told them that, and we had many conversations. I shared my point of view, they shared theirs. We talked it through, and at the end, even though they didn't have to, they really didn't have to, this is a giant company…they welcomed me back on the air."</p><p>On Tuesday night, before the show aired on the East Coast, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, "I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled!" </p><p>He went on, "I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars," Mr. Trump said in reference to his defamation lawsuit last year against ABC News over remarks made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, which the network <span class="link">settled in December</span> by agreeing to contribute $15 million to Mr. Trump's presidential foundation and museum, and another $1 million toward Mr. Trump's legal fees.</p><p>"This one sounds even more lucrative," Mr. Trump wrote Tuesday. "A true bunch of losers!"</p><p>Kimmel told his audience Tuesday that the president "made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke."</p><p>"One thing I did learn from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern, is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like, is anti-American," he added. </p><p>In a Sept. 17 interview with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr called Kimmel's remarks "some of the sickest conduct possible," and said there was a "path forward for suspension over this."</p>
<p>"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at," Carr told Johnson. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way."</p><p>Within hours of that interview, station operator Nexstar announced it would preempt Kimmel's show over the remarks. Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, <span class="link">for $6.2 billion</span>, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it. </p><p>A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision to preempt Kimmel's show was "made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision."</p><p>ABC later said that it was "indefinitely" suspending the show. </p><p>Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.</p><p>Despite its return to ABC on Tuesday night, both Nexstar and Sinclair said they would <span class="link">continue to preempt</span> Kimmel's show.</p><p>Sinclair on Monday night posted a statement on X saying it will preempt "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be "replacing it with news programming" beginning Tuesday night. "Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return," Sinclair said. </p>
<p>Nexstar on Tuesday said it will continue to preempt "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" and "monitor the show as it returns to ABC."</p><p>Regarding Carr, Kimmel on Tuesday showed the audience a social media post that the FCC chair wrote in May 2022 in which he said, "Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while using humor to draw more people in to the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship."  </p> <p>Disney on Monday did not delve into the details of what led to its decision to allow Kimmel's show to resume, only saying in a statement that the initial suspension was "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country," calling his comments "ill-timed and thus insensitive."</p><p>"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday," Disney said.</p><p>The temporary removal of Kimmel's show sparked a nationwide debate over issues of free speech and censorship. Many in the Hollywood community rallied to Kimmel's side, with more than 400 celebrities — including actors Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep — signing an open letter with the American Civil Liberties Union that criticized the move as "a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation."</p><p>Conservatives upset with Kimmel's comments about Kirk praised the decision, including President Trump, who congratulated ABC on his Truth Social platform "for finally having the courage to do what had to be done." </p><p>Mr. Trump <span class="link">also speculated</span> last week whether networks that cover him negatively should have their broadcast licenses revoked. </p>
<p>"They give me only bad publicity or press," the president told reporters on Sept. 18. "I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr."</p><p>But one prominent conservative, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, was specifically critical of Carr's comments to Johnson. </p><p>"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas,'" <span class="link">Cruz said</span> Friday on his podcast. "That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it.'" </p><p>Kimmel's show, which launched in 2003, tapes in front of a studio audience on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. The guests for Tuesday's show included actor Glen Powell and singer Sarah McLachlan. </p>

<div class="article-title">White House suggests U.N. escalator mishap with Trump "doesn't look like a coincidence"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter at the United Nations' New York City headquarters drew President Trump's frustration on Tuesday — though the U.N. says a videographer from Mr. Trump's delegation may have triggered the escalator's safety shutoff.</p><p>Shortly after Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump entered U.N. headquarters to address world leaders at this year's General Assembly session, they stepped onto an escalator. But the machine ground to a halt almost immediately, forcing both Trumps to start climbing the stairs on their own, videos of his arrival show.</p><p>Later, as Mr. Trump began his speech to the General Assembly, he remarked that his teleprompter wasn't working. "I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble," the president said, drawing laughs from the audience.</p><p>The president brought up the two mishaps later in his speech, framing them as metaphors for what he views as the incompetence of the United Nations — which he accused of offering up little more than "empty words."</p><p>"All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that, on the way up, stopped right in the middle. If the first lady wasn't in great shape, she would've fallen," the president said. "These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter."</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later floated a different explanation, writing in a post on X: "If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately."</p>
<p>Leavitt shared a screenshot from a Times of London article that reported U.N. workers had been overheard joking they might intentionally shut off escalators during Mr. Trump's visit and blame funding shortfalls. There is no evidence that U.N. staff followed through on those jokes.</p><p>The press secretary later told Fox News that the Secret Service is looking into the matter.</p><p>"When you put all of this together, it doesn't look like a coincidence to me," Leavitt said on Fox News' "Jesse Watters Primetime." "And if we find that these were U.N. staffers who were purposefully trying to trip up, literally trip up, the president and the first lady of the United States, well, there better be accountability for those people."</p><p>However, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday the escalator may have suddenly stopped because of a videographer from the U.S. delegation who can be seen walking ahead of the president and first lady on the escalator, seemingly to film their arrival.</p>
<p>"A subsequent investigation, including a readout of the machine's central processing unit, indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator. The safety mechanism is designed to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing.

<div class="article-title">Camp Mystic plans to reopen in Texas next summer after flood that killed 27</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Less than three months after the devastating and deadly flooding in the Texas Hill Country, Camp Mystic plans to reopen part of its camp.</p><p>The camp's owners announced plans to reopen the Cypress Lake location, which is separate from the part of the camp that flooded in July, killing 27 girls and counselors.</p><p>In an email sent Monday to the families of the victims and obtained by the Associated Press, the camp said when it reopens, its planning and procedures will follow the "requirements of the camp safety legislation you bravely championed." About an hour later, the camp sent an email to the rest of the families announcing the decision.  </p><p>The email states, "We are not only rebuilding the cabins and trails, but also a place where laughter, friendship and spiritual growth will continue to flourish."</p><p>The camp also announced that it will build a memorial to the girls who died in the flooding.</p>
<p>"In the memorial's design, we will strive to capture the beauty, kindness and grace they all shared, while focusing on the joy they carried and will always inspire in us all," the email said.</p><p>The announcement means that Camp Mystic Cypress Lake, a sister site that opened to campers in 2020, will reopen next summer. But the 99-year-old Camp Mystic Guadalupe was too damaged to open next summer, according to the camp.</p><p>The email said leaders are "working with engineers and other experts to determine how we will implement the changes required" under the newly passed bills.</p><p>The campers and counselors were swept to their deaths when fast-rising floodwaters of the Guadalupe River roared through the girls' summer camp in a low-lying area known as flash flood alley. All told, the destructive flooding in Texas on the Fourth of July killed at least 136 people and washed away homes and vehicles.</p>
<p>Camp Mystic parents successfully pushed for Texas to pass bills aimed at preventing similar tragedies. The measures aim to improve the safety of children's camps by prohibiting cabins in dangerous parts of flood zones and requiring camp operators to develop detailed emergency plans, to train workers and to install and maintain emergency warning systems. One allocates $240 million from the state's rainy day fund for disaster relief, along with money for warning sirens and improved weather forecasting.</p><p>"It will hurt my family forever that, for reasons I still do not know, these protections were not in place nor thought out thoroughly for my daughter and the rest of the girls here," he said. "Please pass this bill, protect our kids and do not let their deaths be in vain."</p>

<div class="article-title">Americans detained by immigration agents speak out about treatment by agents</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Days after federal immigration agents detained Cary Lopez Alvarado, a 23-year-old Los Angeles native and U.S. citizen, she gave birth to a baby girl. </p><p>Lopez Alvarado and her now 3-month-old child are among some Americans who have been caught in the middle of the <span class="link">Trump administration's immigration enforcement</span> and forced to prove their <span class="link">citizenship</span> to gain their release from detention.</p><p>"And they told me, OK, your baby is gonna be born here, but you're from Mexico, right?" Alvarado recounted of the June arrest to CBS News. "And I told them like, 'No, I was born here and I speak English.'"</p><p>Alvarado says she was handcuffed and detained for over eight hours with a chain around her belly. Once she was released, Alvarado says she went straight to the hospital with cuts and bruises. She was also already in labor.</p><p>"At the hospital, they had told me that I was already having contractions every two minutes," she said.</p>
<p>Lopez Alvarado's boyfriend was also detained. He has not seen his newborn and was later deported to Guatemala. </p><p>The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday announced that it is on pace to deport nearly 600,000 undocumented immigrants by the end of 2025.</p><p>Lopez Alvarado, seven other Americans and one green card holder have <span class="link">filed joint legal claims against the U.S. government</span>, alleging they were wrongfully detained and racially profiled — some claim they were beaten by federal officers.</p><p>"What they're doing is they're stopping, detaining, arresting, putting people in federal custody and then asking questions later," said their lawyer, Michael Carrillo.</p>
<p>Juan Rivas, one of the defendants who has a green card, has been working as a day laborer for more than 20 years. Despite having his legal documents on him, Rivas says he was detained at a <span class="link">Home Depot parking lot</span> in Los Angeles on the Fourth of July.</p><p>"I was ready to show them when they started hitting me and threw me on the floor," Rivas said.</p><p>CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment but has not received a response.</p><p>As immigration raids have increased across California and other parts of the country, immigration lawyers and advocates warn that a <span class="link">recent Supreme Court decision</span> can put U.S. citizens at risk of being questioned or detained. Carrillo says he has been advising clients to carry their documents every time they leave their house.</p><p>Earlier this month, the high court agreed to freeze a district court's temporary restraining order that prevented federal immigration authorities from stopping people in Southern California without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. unlawfully. That order barred officials from relying solely on certain factors like a person's race or occupation as the basis for a detentive stop.  </p><p>"Where's my due process? Allow me to present my ID, don't just throw me to the wall. Don't just twist my arm," said <span class="link">Brian Gavidia</span>, a U.S. citizen who was confronted by federal agents outside the car dealership he owns in L.A.</p><p>Gavidia told CBS Los Angeles that the agent took both his phone and Real ID. He said his friend started filming and agents released Gavidia after they verified his citizenship. He now says he regrets voting for President Trump.</p>
<p>"I truly believed it was the worst of the worst, not Americans, not our day laborers, not our farmworkers," Gavidia said, referring to Mr. Trump's and other administration officials' <span class="link">vow to deport undocumented immigrants with violent criminal records</span>. </p>

<div class="article-title">Zelenskyy says he's surprised after Trump argues Ukraine can regain all its land</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday he was surprised by President Trump's post arguing the Eastern European country could regain all of its territory captured by Russia. </p><p>Mr. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that Zelenskyy's forces are "in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form" with Europe's help.  The unexpected remarks — which called the Russian military a "paper tiger" — came after Mr. Trump met with Zelenskyy for about an hour Tuesday on the sidelines of <span class="link">the United Nations General Assembly</span> in New York City.</p><p>The comments appear to mark a dramatic shift for Mr. Trump, who <span class="link">said last month</span> he expected "some swapping of territories" as part of an eventual Russia-Ukraine ceasefire deal. Russia occupies large parts of eastern Ukraine, including territories captured in 2014 and in the current war that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>Asked later Tuesday by Fox News' Bret Baier if he was surprised by the U.S. president's about-face, Zelenskyy laughed and responded, "a little bit."</p><p>Zelenskyy said he and Mr. Trump had a positive conversation on Tuesday, and he believes Mr. Trump's position on territorial swaps has changed.</p>
<p>"I think he understands for today that we can't just swap territories. It's not fair," he said.</p><p>During their meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that Zelenskyy was "putting up one hell of a fight," and he believes the "biggest progress" is that the Russian economy is "terrible." But the U.S. leader <span class="link">didn't appear optimistic</span> about a quick resolution to the war, telling reporters, "It looks like it's not going to end for a long time."</p><p>Mr. Trump has pressed both Russia and Ukraine to reach a ceasefire deal to end their more than three-year-long war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. </p><p>But a deal has remained elusive as both sides' public positions remain far apart. The Kremlin has <span class="link">pushed Zelenskyy</span> to fully withdraw from large swaths of eastern Ukraine, an idea Zelenskyy has rejected as unfair and unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Ukraine has sought international security guarantees to deter another Russian attack if the current conflict ends.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has lashed out at both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin at various points. He <span class="link">met with Putin in Alaska last month</span>, but he has criticized the Russian leader for continued strikes on Ukraine, and said last week that Putin had "really let me down."</p><p>The U.S. president also pressed NATO countries earlier this month to stop buying Russian oil and to impose hefty tariffs on China, which has remained aligned with Russia, writing that those moves could "be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR."</p><p>Separately, Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he believes NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter their airspace, after <span class="link">Russian drones entered Poland</span> earlier this month and <span class="link">Russian fighter jets allegedly entered Estonian airspace</span>.</p><p>At other points, though, Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy have had a rocky relationship. An Oval Office meeting between the two leaders earlier this year <span class="link">descended into a shouting match</span>, and Mr. Trump has occasionally blamed Zelenskyy for the war.</p><p>During his interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said he believes his relationship with his American counterpart has improved.</p><p>"I think we have better relation[s] than before," Zelenskyy said. "I think we didn't have close relation[s] because we didn't have, maybe, time. I don't know."</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Nexstar Media on Tuesday said it will continue to preempt "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its television stations when the late-night show returns tonight after an <span class="link">almost week-long hiatus on ABC</span>. </p><p>Nexstar's move parallels that of local TV station owner Sinclair, which on Monday said it would also continue to preempt the show after it returns to ABC. Both Nexstar and Sinclair own ABC-affiliated television stations.</p><p>On Tuesday, Nexstar said it will "monitor the show as it returns to ABC."</p><p>Last week, ABC had indefinitely preempted the show following comments Kimmel made on the show in response to <span class="link">the shooting death</span> of conservative activist <span class="link">Charlie Kirk</span>. The decisions by Nexstar and Sinclair, two of the largest owners of TV affiliates, mean "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" won't appear tonight on dozens of ABC stations in cities across the U.S. </p><p>The two corporations collectively control about a quarter of ABC affiliates. Nexstar operates 33 ABC affiliates, with its largest market represented by WKRN-TV in Nashville. Sinclair runs 38 ABC stations, including KOMO-TV in Seattle. </p>
<p>At the same time, Nexstar has a <span class="link">$6.2 billion deal pending to purchase Tegna</span>, a smaller rival, and requires approval from the Federal Communications Commission to move forward with the acquisition.</p> <p>Last week, a Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News that the decision was "made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision."</p><p>In its Tuesday statement, Nexstar said it stands by its decision last week to preempt the show "pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve."</p><p>It added, "In the meantime, we note that 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' will be available nationwide on multiple Disney-owned streaming products, while our stations will focus on continuing to produce local news and other programming relevant to their respective markets."</p>
<p>Guests scheduled to appear on Kimmel's show on Tuesday include actor Glen Powell and singer Sarah McLachlan. </p>

<div class="article-title">World experts reject Trump's claims about Tylenol, autism link</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Health experts from around the globe are joining the chorus of doctors and organizations pushing back against the <span class="link">Trump administration's announcement Monday</span> linking the use of acetaminophen — the active ingredient in Tylenol and many cold and flu medications — during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism in children.</p><p>"Effective immediately, the FDA will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism," President Trump said at a news conference with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others.</p><p>In a statement Tuesday, the European Union's European Medicines Agency said there is currently "no new evidence" that would require changes to the current EU recommendations for use of acetaminophen, also commonly called paracetamol outside the U.S.</p><p>"Paracetamol remains an important option to treat pain or fever in pregnant women," Steffen Thirstrup, EMA's chief medical officer, said in the statement. "Our advice is based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children."</p><p>The United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said Tuesday, "taking paracetamol during pregnancy remains safe."</p>
<p>"There is no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children," the agency's chief safety officer Dr. Alison Cave said in the statement. </p><p>In a combined statement, Australia's chief medical officer and the country's medicine regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, said they were joining "other global medicines regulators, leading clinicians and scientists worldwide in rejecting claims regarding the use of paracetamol in pregnancy, and the subsequent risk of development of ADHD or autism in children."</p><p>"Robust scientific evidence shows no causal link between the use of paracetamol in pregnancy and autism or ADHD, with several large and reliable studies directly contradicting these claims," the statement continued. </p><p>While sharing a statement from Spain's Ministry of Health that stated paracetamol can be used during pregnancy, the country's minister of health, Mónica García, called out Mr. Trump specifically for misinformation and lack of evidence. </p>
<p>"Trump's new crusade is against paracetamol during pregnancy, ignoring all scientific evidence," she wrote on X. "This denialism only sows alarm and misinformation. It's better to listen to health authorities than to the person who suggested injecting bleach against COVID," referring to <span class="link">a remark Mr. Trump made</span> in 2020. </p><p>A World Health Organization spokesperson said Tuesday that evidence of a link between the use of paracetamol during pregnancy and autism "remains inconsistent," according to Reuters.</p><p>International-based studies have been part of the evidence that shows acetaminophen use during pregnancy is safe.</p><p>In a major study published last year, for example, researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found that acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.</p><p>In the U.S., organizations — including one that represents those who treat pregnant patients, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists — have countered the claimed link, saying there's "no clear evidence."</p><p>The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents some of the largest makers of over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, said, "Safety is the top priority for manufacturers," and "the well-established profile of acetaminophen is supported by decades of research and real-world use."</p><p>And the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement that any association between acetaminophen and autism is based on "limited, conflicting, and inconsistent science."</p>

<div class="article-title">Ryan Routh guilty in Trump assassination attempt, tries to stab himself after verdict</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A Florida jury on Tuesday found <span class="link">Ryan Routh</span> guilty of an assassination attempt against then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. </p><p><span class="link">Routh represented himself</span> in the trial. He was found guilty of all five charges, which included attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate and assaulting a federal officer. </p><p>Routh was arrested in September 2024 at Mr. Trump's golf course. A Secret Service agent testified last week that he spotted Routh before the then-presidential candidate came into view. Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot, the agent said.</p><p>After the verdict was read, Routh apparently tried to harm himself, possibly using a pen that was on his desk, to stab himself in the neck. His daughter cried out during the incident and U.S. marshals eventually tackled him. </p><p>It was the second assassination attempt against Mr. Trump in 2024, after shots were fired in a separate incident at a Pennsylvania rally. A bullet grazed Mr. Trump's ear in that incident. </p>
<p>Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the guilty verdict against Routh "illustrates the Department of Justice's commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence," and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the verdict sends "a clear message" that an "attempt to assassinate a presidential candidate is an attack on our Republic and on the rights of every citizen." </p><p>A federal district judge will determine his sentence. He faces life in prison.</p><p>In a nearly hourlong closing argument on Tuesday, Routh said that there was no intent to kill because the trigger was never pulled, the gun was never fired and that no one was hurt, so "no crime."  </p><p>"I wanted to kill, my actions within the community and toward my co-workers and family should show my obvious non-violence and gentleness," Routh said. Speaking about himself in the third person, he said the shooting was never going to happen because it was "never in his heart." </p>
<p>But prosecutors said Routh spent weeks plotting to kill Mr. Trump, who was then running for president. Prosecutors laid out Routh's actions ahead of the incident, saying "those aren'tcoincidences … that's a plan," prosecutor Christopher Brown said in his closing argument. </p><p>"He had a loaded round in the chamber and the safety off," Brown said. "We don't have to prove motive, but you already have it. You only have to decide intent." </p><p>Prosecutors also alleged in court filings that Routh attempted to acquire an anti-aircraft weapon to <span class="link">shoot down Mr. Trump's plane</span>.</p><p>Routh had initially submitted a witness list that included Mr. Trump, as well as Columbia activists Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi — to whom his connections are unclear — and several prominent authors. Judge Aileen Canon had rejected many of these potential witnesses.</p><p><em>Jacob Rosen, Daniel Shepherd and The Associated Press contributed to this report. </em></p>

<div class="article-title">MLB approves robot umpires as part of challenge system in 2026</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><span class="link">Robot umpires</span> are getting called up to the big leagues next season.</p><p>Major League Baseball's 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System in the major leagues in 2026.</p><p>Human plate umpires will still call balls and strikes, but teams can challenge two calls per game and get additional appeals in extra innings. Challenges must be made by a pitcher, catcher or batter — signaled by tapping their helmet or cap — and a team retains its challenge if successful. Reviews will be shown as digital graphics on outfield videoboards.</p><p>Adding the robot umps is likely to cut down on ejections. MLB said 61.5% of ejections among players, managers and coaches last year were related to balls and strikes, as were 60.3% this season through Sunday. The figures include ejections for derogatory comments, throwing equipment while protesting calls and inappropriate conduct.</p><p>Big league umpires call roughly 94% of pitches correctly, according to UmpScorecards.</p>
<p>ABS, which utilizes Hawk-Eye cameras, has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019. The independent Atlantic League trialed the system at its 2019 All-Star Game and MLB installed the technology for that year's Arizona Fall League of top prospects. The ABS was tried at eight of nine ballparks of the Low-A Southeast League in 2021, then moved up to Triple-A in 2022.</p>
<p>In 2019, Fred DeJesus became the first umpire in a regular-season game to use ABS. He remembers the first pitch he tested – it was a strike – and how he was hesitant about the new technology at first.</p><p>"Initially, it was like, no way, we're not doing this. I spent way too much money trying to learn the craft of calling balls and strikes," he <span class="link">told CBS News</span> in 2021.</p><p>At Triple-A at the start of the 2023 season, half the games used the robots for ball/strike calls and half had a human making decisions subject to appeals by teams to the ABS.</p><p>MLB switched Triple-A to an all-challenge system on June 26, 2024, then used the challenge system this year at 13 spring training ballparks hosting 19 teams for a total of 288 exhibition games. Teams won 52.2% of their ball/strike challenges (617 of 1,182) challenges.</p>
<p>At Triple-A this season, the average challenges per game increased to 4.2 from 3.9 through Sunday and the success rate dropped to 49.5% from 50.6%. Defenses were successful in 53.7% of challenges this year and offenses in 45%.</p><p>ABS was used in this year's All-Star Game as well and has generally received positive reviews, CBS Sports reported. Four of five challenges of plate umpire Dan Iassogna's calls were successful in July.</p><p>Teams in Triple-A do not get additional challenges in extra innings. However, the proposal approved by the MLB on Tuesday included a provision granting teams one additional challenge each inning if they don't have challenges remaining.</p><p>MLB has experimented with different shapes and interpretations of the strike zone with ABS, including versions that were three-dimensional. Currently, it calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone is 53.5% of batter height and the bottom 27%.</p><p>This will be MLB's first major rule change since sweeping adjustments in 2024. Those included a pitch clock, restrictions on defensive shifts, pitcher disengagements such as pickoff attempts and larger bases.</p><p>The challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers. While there was concern that full-blown ABS would make some strong defensive catchers obsolete, not everyone considers the skill a good thing.</p><p>"The idea that people get paid for cheating, for stealing strikes, for moving a pitch that's not a strike into the zone to fool the official and make it a strike is beyond my comprehension," former manager Bobby Valentine said.</p>
<p>Texas manager Bruce Bochy, a big league catcher from 1978-87, maintained old-school umpires such as Bruce Froemming and Billy Williams never would have accepted pitch framing. He said they would have told him: "'If you do that again, you'll never get a strike.' I'm cutting out some words."</p><p>Management officials on the competition committee include Seattle chairman John Stanton, St. Louis CEO Bill DeWitt Jr., San Francisco chairman Greg Johnson, Colorado CEO Dick Monfort, Toronto CEO Mark Shapiro and Boston chairman Tom Werner.</p><p>Players include Arizona's Corbin Burnes and Zac Gallen, Detroit's Casey Mize, Seattle's Cal Raleigh and the New York Yankees' Austin Slater, with the Chicago Cubs' Ian Happ at Detroit's Casey Mize as alternates. The union representatives make their decisions based on input from players on the 30 teams.</p><p>Bill Miller is the umpire representative.</p><p>The competition committee can unilaterally implement on-field rule changes with 45 days' notice to the MLB Players Association, according to CBS Sports. </p>

<div class="article-title">"Nightmare bacteria" cases are rising in the U.S., researchers say</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Infection rates from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.</p><p>Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in an article published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said. </p><p>Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.</p><p>"The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome," said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.</p><p>It's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said. </p>
<p>That may play out in doctors' offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat — like urinary tract infections — could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report's authors.</p><p><span class="link">Antimicrobial resistance</span> occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise — unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn't kill the germs made them stronger.</p><p>In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to "<span class="link">nightmare bacteria</span>" resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.</p><p>Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.</p>
<p>They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.</p><p>The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 — an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460%, the authors said.</p><p>A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>"We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance," said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.</p><p>The CDC's count is only a partial picture. </p><p>Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren't able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.</p><p>The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections "is definitely underestimated," Burnham said.</p>
<p>This is not the first study to report a rise. A CDC report published in June noted an increase in NDM cases in New York City between 2019 and 2024. </p>

<div class="article-title">New York City may move its mayoral elections to even years. It'd be part of a trend</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>One of the most closely watched elections this fall is New York City's mayoral race. But New York voters will also weigh in on a lesser-known proposal that could move future city elections to even-numbered years.</p> <p>It's part of a growing trend to consolidate election dates — adding local races to the ballot during presidential and midterm elections.</p> <p>Proponents of the effort say it counters persistently low turnout for local elections, despite concerns about local issues and candidates getting overshadowed.</p> <p>Right now, most local races across the country — for things like city council, school board and bond measures — are "off-cycle," or don't coincide with federal elections, according to Katy Owens Hubler, director of elections and redistricting at the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<p>"So, all throughout the year, you know, any given Tuesday, there's probably an election somewhere in the country," she said.</p>
<p>Many states require in their constitution that local races be separate from federal and state elections. About a third of states leave it up to local officials to decide when to have local elections, said Zoli Hajnal, a political science professor at UC San Diego. And most local officials choose to have their elections during odd-numbered years.</p> <p>"I think it's the sort of feeling of not wanting to get lost in the shuffle," said Hubler, adding that city leaders often worry their smaller contests and local issues will be overshadowed by bigger races.</p> <p>"There could also be a campaign finance aspect of this where they feel that they can't actually raise the funds that they need to run a campaign because they're competing with the state-level candidates or even national-level candidates," she said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A main driver for reform: "extremely low" turnout</h3> <p>Holding local races in odd-numbered years, though, has resulted in what Hajnal describes as "extremely low" turnout — and it's only gotten worse over the past several decades.</p> <p>"And there is essentially no better solution to low voter turnout at the local level than moving local elections to the same day as statewide and federal elections," he said.</p>
<p>Hajnal uses Las Vegas as an example. When the Nevada Legislature first gave cities the option to move their local races to even-numbered years, very few cities made the change. Turnout in Las Vegas averaged about 37,000. But once it was required in 2019, the first election on-cycle saw more than 244,000 Las Vegas voters cast ballots.</p>
<p>Another benefit of moving local races, Hajnal said, is that it also expands the electorate.</p> <p>"So as you move to on-cycle elections, you also change the mix of voters," he said. "And the biggest thing is you get a lot more younger voters. You also get more racial and ethnic minority voters, people of color, and potentially also some greater mix of working class and poor Americans participating as well."</p> <h3 class="edTag">More elections mean higher costs</h3> <p>In recent years, efforts to boost turnout have been typically associated with the political left. But some conservative groups, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, agree with consolidating elections.</p> <p>Though ALEC has called for some restrictions on voting, such as strict voter ID laws, the organization wants more eligible voters to participate, said Katie Thompson, a director at ALEC.</p> <p>Thompson said ALEC is recommending GOP-led states move their local races to on-cycle elections as a cost-saving measure as well. She noted that local governments have to spend a lot of money on local elections on things like paper, electricity and staffing.</p> <p>"Even when you're looking at the volunteers required to staff elections, it is way harder to get the personnel you need during off-cycle years," she said. "And personnel is really important to the security of elections, which I think we can all agree is an important factor. We want the polls to be adequately staffed."</p> <p>This year 29 states introduced legislation aimed at consolidating election dates in some way or another, including Democratic-run states such as Washington and Republican-run states like Indiana. And so far, 12 states have enacted these laws.</p>
<p>If passed this fall, New York City's ballot measure would require a change to the state constitution before it could go into effect.</p>
<p>Hajnal said this uptick in discussions about election timing is somewhat unprecedented.</p> <p>"There's absolutely no doubt there's a major trend towards consolidation or aligning elections," he said. "It's getting a lot more attention and a lot more action and at least looks like into the future a lot more momentum for further reform."</p> <p>Besides the cost and low turnout, there is also the concern that all these scattered elections create a lot of work for election administrators, Hubler said.</p> <p>"There's all these things that you have to do for a regular election anyway. And now you can just do that once as opposed to a number of different times for the smaller races," she said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">One concern: Longer ballots</h3> <p>There are concerns, however, about consolidated elections leading to longer ballots, which cost more and can cause longer lines at polling signs or overwhelm voters.</p> <p>Hajnal said they could also create a situation where voters will get tired and just skip those local races at the end of their ballot, anyway.</p> <p>"Yes, there is some ballot drop-off," he said. "So the longer the ballot, the more people who drop off. But the jump in participation is so high that it much more than offsets that small ballot drop-off."</p> <p>Thompson said the longer ballot would probably be worth it to voters.</p> <p>"The extra few minutes it would take to fill out the next two or three races on the ballot is still less time than knowing that there's an election, driving to the polls, voting, driving all the way home," she said. "It would just be more convenient for people to have those elections on one ballot in a consolidated place versus having to go to all this extra time and expense and effort to go for a whole separate election cycle."</p>

<div class="article-title">Love pumpkin spice lattes? Learn some of its spicy history</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Temperatures are cooling and the sun is setting earlier: Fall is on the way.</p> <p>And with it, autumnal goodies like apple cider, pumpkin bread and those all-too-popular pumpkin spice lattes.</p> <p>But before you take a sip of that cinnamony, nutmegy, clovey goodness, let's dive into the history of the word "spicy" for this installment of Word of the Week.</p> <p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest evidence for "spicy" is from 1562, in the writings of William Turner, a naturalist and religious controversialist.</p> <p>"For a long, long time, spicy meant exactly what it is supposed to be: that which is containing spice, or redolent of spice," Anatoly Liberman, a linguist at the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>But it was around the 19th century, that records show people started to use spicy in other less literal ways, he said. It can also refer to "racy" or "engagingly provocative" in reference to scandalous gossip or anything tantalizing.</p>
<p>"It's smart. It's stylish. It's anything that has the impression of giving something sharp, poignant, interesting, out of the way, biting, whatever you want," Liberman said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">A look at some "spicy" history</h3> <p>Spices have been traded for thousands of years, according to Michael Krondl, author of <em>The Taste of Conquest: The Rise and Fall of the Three Great Cities of Spice</em>.</p> <p>Archeologists found peppercorns up the noses of ancient pharaohs and the Romans used to import huge amounts of black pepper for cooking from India and tons of cinnamon, which they would burn as an incense, he said.</p>
<p>Spices, like cinnamon, clove, pepper and ginger, "were always considered extremely exotic, and as a consequence, they were very highly valued," Krondl said. They were also associated with holiness and exoticism.</p> <p>"Medieval Europeans would think that dead saints would smell of spices. So that you would sniff the coffin of a saint and it would be redolent of cinnamon and cloves and nutmeg," Krondl explained.</p>
<p>Spices, of course, were typically grown in tropical places like India, Africa and Southeast Asia, and far from the European aristocracy, who craved these spices, and were willing to pay high prices for them, he said.</p> <p>And they were willing to travel far to get it.</p>
<p>Europeans sent famous explorers like Vasco da Gama and the mis-directed Christopher Columbus on journeys to find the original sources for spices and to bring back hundreds of pounds of the stuff.</p> <p>The Dutch created the East India Trading Company in 1602 (which lasted until 1799) to profit from the spice trade. It evolved into a global company that relied on forced labor and slavery.</p> <p>"Nobody needed spices, except for social capital," Krondl said. "They were almost this arbitrary marker of wealth and privilege, and yet, the world was completely transformed through the trade in spices."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">How were spices used</h3> <p>Once in the hands of these wealthy Europeans they wouldn't always use spices to add flavor to food or drinks (pumpkin spice lattes were several centuries from coming to fruition). They were believed to have healing properties.</p> <p>"They were food and medicine simultaneously," Krondl said, especially during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.</p> <p>If someone was ill, they could be given different kinds of spices depending on their personality or status, he explained.</p> <p>As Liberman explained, around the 19th century "spicy" became a word to refer to anything that gives us a sharp or pronounced kind of response.</p> <p>Looking back on this tasty history allows us to realize we are using these spices in many similar ways as the ancient times, Krondl said.</p> <p>"We're doing the same thing as the Romans," Krondl said. "We're heating up those spices in candles – instead of burning them on pyres to aromatize our rooms."<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">NPR's middle school champion: A moving podcast about Japanese incarceration</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>When Ameya Desai won the fourth grade prize of NPR's Student Podcast Challenge last year, something surprising happened: A neighbor reached out asking if the 11-year-old journalist would interview his grandmother, a survivor of the Japanese incarceration camps.</p>
<p>Ameya was amazed, shocked that she had never learned this history before, one that takes place in her hometown, San Jose, Calif.</p> <p>That spark led her to 85-year-old Linda Horikawa, who recalls being  "surprised that someone in the fifth grade was interested in the relocation of Japanese Americans during World War II." </p> <p>Horikawa was hesitant at first. Then she thought: "It was a good time to tell everyone what <em>really happened</em>."</p> <p>The result is Ameya's podcast, <em>Shikata Ga Nai, Far From Home: Stories of Forced Migration</em><em>.</em> </p>
<p>The story begins in 1940, on a berry ranch in Cupertino, Calif. "We had boysenberries, blackberries and strawberries," she tells Ameya. "We were very happy there."</p> <p>But those happy times at the family farm were soon upended, when Horikawa was 2 years old.</p> <p>"Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, there was a growing resentment towards Japanese Americans, many of whom were questioned about their loyalty to the United States," Ameya explains in the podcast.</p> <p>In 1942, the United States forced roughly 120,000 Japanese Americans to leave their homes on the West Coast.</p>
<p>Horikawa shares vivid, chilling details about life in the incarceration camp in Heart Mountain, Wyo., like guns pointed at her family upon arrival. They were put in tar-paper shacks. Her entire family shared one room with no running water, just a stove for eating. No individual bathrooms, but a tight row of toilets for everyone to share.</p> <p>And it was three years before they were able to return to California. Even then, it wasn't easy integrating back to a community they once called home.</p> <p>"There was prejudice," Horikawa says in a watery voice. "Kids would say to us, 'your eyes go like this.' But it affected my parents more. I saw that the joy that they had in life was kind of gone."</p>
<p><strong>Reopening a trunk full of history</strong></p> <p>Our judges picked Ameya's podcast from nearly 2,000 entries we received this year. They were moved by Horikawa's story, and charmed by the care and curiosity in Ameya's voice and in her writing. Adelina Lancianese, senior producer of NPR's <em>Embedded</em>, said their interview has "<em>Story Corps</em> vibes."</p> <p>In the seven years of the Student Podcast Challenge, Ameya is the first returning champion.</p> <p>Last year, she was among the winners in our fourth grade category, for her podcast <em>Far From Home — A Story of Forced Migration</em>. In it, she interviewed her grandfather about his family's journey from India to Uganda to the United States.</p> <p>In this new podcast, Horikawa opened up for her young friend a black trunk full of documents that had been sitting in her closet. </p>
<p>She carefully dusts off a Ziploc bag holding relocation authority passes, identification cards they had to wear at all times. There are newsletters and newspaper clippings about the war, the incarceration camps and families being sent back to California.</p> <p>She holds onto a white towel her mom brought home from the camp, with "Heart Mountain" monogrammed in blue.</p> <p>After the family returned to California, Horikawa grew up in San Jose and became a kindergarten teacher in Ameya's school district. She taught there for 40 years and retired.</p> <p>"I don't think the Japanese people dwell on it," she says. "Culturally, something that's happened that's distasteful to you, you don't bring it up. It's not like a big secret. It's just that you don't want to discuss it, because you felt ashamed that it happened to you."</p> <p>Her parents avoided conversations about it growing up, and Horikawa, too, hadn't opened up the trunk in 25 years, until her interview with Ameya.</p>
<p>"Being a teacher, you want to further children's interest in different things," she continues as she looks at Ameya, "And here, I found a friend."</p>
<p>Holding her friend's hand, Ameya says getting to share Horikawa's story means so much more than her big win.</p> <p>"I am honored," she says. "It means that another story will not be lost in time, another story that may help people not repeat the same mistakes."</p> <p>You can listen to  <em>Shikata Ga Nai, Far From Home: Stories of Forced Migration, </em>here<em>.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Typhoon Ragasa batters Hong Kong and southern China</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>SHENZHEN, China — Typhoon Ragasa, one of the strongest in years, whipped waves taller than lampposts onto Hong Kong promenades and turned seas rough on the southern Chinese coast on Wednesday after leaving deadly destruction in Taiwan and the Philippines.</p> <p>In Taiwan, 14 people died in a flooded township, and 10 deaths were reported in the Philippines.</p> <p>Nearly 1.9 million people were relocated across Guangdong province, the southern Chinese economic powerhouse. A weather station in Chuandao town recorded maximum gusts of 241 kph (about 150 mph) at noon, a high in Jiangmen city since record-keeping began. Huge waves battered Zhuhai city's coastline and strong winds buffered trees under intense rain. Fallen branches were scattered on the streets.</p>
<p>The national weather agency forecast the severe typhoon would make landfall between the cities of Yangjiang and Zhanjiang on Wednesday evening. Schools, factories and transportation services were suspended in about a dozen cities.</p>
<p>The fierce winds, brought by Ragasa, once a super typhoon, woke Hong Kong residents in the early hours, and many went online to describe scenes like a kitchen ventilation fan being blown down and a crane swaying.</p> <p>Strong winds blew away parts of a pedestrian bridge's roof and knocked down hundreds of trees across the city. A vessel crashed into the shore, shattering a row of glass railings along the waterfront. Areas around some rivers and promenades were flooded, including cycling lanes and playgrounds. At several promenade restaurants, furniture was scattered chaotically by the winds. Over 60 injured people were treated at hospitals.</p> <p>A video that showed waves of water crashing through the doors of a hotel and flooding its interiors went viral in the financial hub. The hotel has not immediately commented on the incident. But staff were seen cleaning up the lobby, with parts of its exterior damaged.</p> <p>Hong Kong and Macao, a nearby casino hub, canceled schools and flights, with many shops closed. Hundreds of people sought refuge in temporary centers in each city. Streets in Macao turned into streams with various debris floating on the water. Rescue crews deployed inflatable boats to save those who were trapped. The gambling city's local electricity supplier suspended its power supply in some flooded, low-lying areas for safety.</p>
<p>As winds gradually weakened in the afternoon, a few cities distant from the expected landfall location were preparing to resume normal operations.</p> <p>Hong Kong's observatory said Ragasa had maximum sustained winds near the center of about 195 kph (120 mph) and skirted around 100 kilometers (62 miles) to the south of the financial hub. The city categorizes cyclones with sustained winds 185 kph or stronger as super typhoons to make residents extra vigilant about intense storms.</p>
<p>The observatory said Ragasa is the strongest tropical cyclone in the northwestern Pacific and South China Sea region so far this year. Preliminary analysis showed it also ranks as the second-strongest one in the South China Sea region since the observatory's record-keeping began in 1950, tying with typhoons Saola in 2023 and Yagi in 2024, it said.</p> <p>Ragasa earlier caused deaths and damage in Taiwan and the Philippines after the typhoon took a path between them.</p> <p>In Taiwan, heavy rain caused a barrier lake in Hualien County to overflow Tuesday and torrents of muddy water destroyed a bridge, turning roads in Guangfu township into churning rivers that carried vehicles and furniture away. Guangfu has about 8,450 people, more than half of whom sought safety on higher floors of their homes or on higher ground. Local authorities said 14 people died and contact was lost with 124 others in the township. Taiwan's Central News Agency said rescuers were going door-to-door to check on these residents.</p> <p>Separately, 34 people were injured across the self-ruled island.</p> <p>At least 10 deaths were reported in the Philippines, including seven fishermen who drowned after their boat was battered by huge waves and fierce wind and flipped over on Monday off Santa Ana town in northern Cagayan province. Five other fishermen remained missing, provincial officials said.</p> <p>Nearly 700,000 people were affected by the onslaught in the main northern Philippine region of Luzon, including 25,000 people who who fled to government emergency shelters.</p>

<div class="article-title">'We have to speak out,' Jimmy Kimmel says in his late night return</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>"I'm not sure who had a weirder 48 hours — me, or the CEO of Tylenol," Jimmy Kimmel joked as he opened his show Tuesday night to a standing ovation after nearly a week away.</p> <p>In a monologue that turned emotional, the comedian choked up addressing the family of Charlie Kirk, the right-wing activist who was killed Sept. 10.</p> <p>"I've been hearing a lot about what I need to say and do tonight," he said. "And the truth is, I don't think what I have to say is going to make much of a difference … I have no illusions about changing anyone's mind."</p>
<p>Kimmel said, however, that he wanted to make one thing clear: "It was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man."</p> <p>He said he meant it when he posted a message on Instagram sending love to Kirk's family after he was killed. And Kimmel said he understood why some folks were upset last week when he made comments about Kirk's assassination.</p> <p>But the host also warned about threats to free speech.</p> <p>"This show isn't important — what's important is that we get to live in a country that <em>allows </em>us to have a show like this," he said.</p> <p>The comedian acknowledged that bringing <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em><br/>back on the air puts Disney at risk, because, he said, the president "can't take a joke."</p> <p>"We have to speak out against it."</p> <p>After Kimmel's show taped — and about an hour before it aired on the East Coast — President Trump took to Truth Social to warn ABC.</p> <p>"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back," Trump wrote. "The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his 'talent' was never there. Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who's not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE."</p>
<p>In his post, Trump also hinted at legal action.</p> <p>"He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this."</p> <p>Kimmel was suspended by ABC and Disney last Wednesday after the Trump administration took issue with his comments about the suspect in Charlie Kirk's killing.</p> <p>"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it," Kimmel said on his show last Monday.</p>
<p>Brendan Carr, chair of the Federal Communications Commission, wasn't pleased that the comedian had characterized the suspect as a MAGA conservative. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," he told podcaster Benny Johnson, taking aim at ABC and Disney. "These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead."</p> <p>Carr encouraged local stations to push back and refuse to run <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live! </em></p> <p>Nexstar and Sinclair, which operate ABC stations around the country, including in Nashville, Salt Lake City, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., Seattle, and Portland, Ore., both pulled the show off their airwaves. ABC and Disney then suspended Kimmel indefinitely.</p> <p>This week, even after Disney said the host would return to his regular 11:35 p.m. ET timeslot on ABC, Sinclair and Nexstar said they would continue preempting the show. Kimmel said that some of his own family couldn't watch on Tuesday.</p> <p>"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return," Sinclair said in a Monday statement.</p> <p>Nexstar, which needs FCC approval for a multibillion-dollar merger with TEGNA, said on Tuesday that it stood by the decision to preempt Kimmel's show, "pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve."</p>

<div class="article-title">Camp Mystic plans to reopen in Texas next summer, a year after floods killed 27</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Camp Mystic plans to reopen next summer near the site where 27 girls and counselors died in a July flood.</p> <p>The campers and counselors were swept to their deaths when fast-rising floodwaters of the Guadalupe River roared through the girls' summer camp in a low-lying area known as flash flood alley. All told, the destructive flooding in Texas on the Fourth of July killed at least 136 people and washed away homes and vehicles.</p>
<p>In an email sent Monday to the families of the victims, the camp said when it reopens, its planning and procedures will follow the "requirements of the camp safety legislation you bravely championed." About an hour later, the camp sent an email to the rest of the families announcing the decision.</p> <p>The camp also announced that it will build a memorial to the girls who died in the flooding.</p> <p>"In the memorial's design, we will strive to capture the beauty, kindness and grace they all shared, while focusing on the joy they carried and will always inspire in us all," the email said.</p>
<p>Camp Mystic parents successfully pushed for Texas to pass bills aimed at preventing similar tragedies. The measures aim to improve the safety of children's camps by prohibiting cabins in dangerous parts of flood zones and requiring camp operators to develop detailed emergency plans, to train workers and to install and maintain emergency warning systems. One allocates $240 million from the state's rainy day fund for disaster relief, along with money for warning sirens and improved weather forecasting.</p> <p>"It will hurt my family forever that, for reasons I still do not know, these protections were not in place nor thought out thoroughly for my daughter and the rest of the girls here," he said. "Please pass this bill, protect our kids and do not let their deaths be in vain."</p>
<p>The announcement means that Camp Mystic Cypress Lake, a sister site that opened to campers in 2020, will reopen next summer. But the 99-year-old Camp Mystic Guadalupe was too damaged to open next summer, according to the camp.</p> <p>The email said leaders are "working with engineers and other experts to determine how we will implement the changes required" under the newly passed bills.</p>

<div class="article-title">Want a seat at this synagogue for the High Holidays? You have to register to vote first</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Two and a half weeks before the start of the Jewish New Year, Congregation Shaare Zion in Brooklyn sent out a letter to its congregants with an unprecedented request. It said that in order to secure seats for High Holidays services — the holiest days of the Jewish year — you must show proof of voter registration.</p> <p>The synagogue's letter comes weeks before New York City's mayoral election on November 4. It reads in part, "We believe we must put in our best effort to try to avoid a very serious danger that can affect all of us."</p>
<p>The letter does not mention any candidate by name. Nor does it tell congregants what party to register with, or who to vote for or against. But it does warn that the outcome of the election could result in "very serious problems" for the Jewish community, and that as a result the synagogue had no choice but to make this requirement.</p> <p>Shaare Zion is the largest Syrian synagogue in New York City, and an important and influential part of the Sephardic Jewish community. That includes Jews with roots in the Iberian Peninsula, and sometimes Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East and North Africa.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Synagogue-state relations</h3> <p>Scholars who study church-state relations say they cannot recall another house of worship ever taking this kind of step.</p> <p>"Asking a congregant to register with the implications that it's for the mayoral election in a Jewish congregation implies very much a divine sanction for voting and perhaps leaning one way or the other," said Mark Valeri, professor of religion and politics at Washington University in St. Louis.</p> <p>"My surmise is there is fear of [Zohran] Mamdani being elected," said Valeri.</p> <p>Mark Treyger is CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council and a former city councilmember who represented the south Brooklyn district that includes Shaare Zion. He says the concerns raised in the letter are ones he's heard elsewhere about Mamdani, who won the Democratic primary in June.</p>
<p>"Given his victory, it has compounded existing concerns that were raised before this primary occurred about public safety and the future of policing and how to handle protests and how to protect shuls [synagogues] and schools," said Treyger.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Is it religiously permissible?</h3> <p>Even with these concerns in mind, there are lingering questions about a synagogue's ability to require voter registration.</p> <p>Valeri says because of the letter's careful wording — it doesn't name a candidate or tell people how to vote — there's no obvious legal issue with it.</p> <p>Religiously, the question is different.</p> <p>"It is terribly unusual," said Rabbi David Bleich, a high ranking and respected rabbinical authority at Yeshiva University in New York. "The question isn't whether it's unusual — it's whether it's permissible."</p> <p>By "permissible," Bleich means according to Jewish law.</p> <p>"On what grounds would a religious organization impose all sorts of conditions that have nothing to do with religion or spirituality?" said Bleich.</p> <p>Rabbi Bleich says synagogues often have membership requirements. And — he thinks people <em>should </em>vote. But combining the two – having requirements in order to attend services? It doesn't sit well with him.</p> <p>"The only way they can even work under any kind of color of religious right is by claiming that these people are in violation of a religious duty," said Bleich. "And I respond by asking — do you require that any Jew entering be a Sabbath observer also? It's a little bit ludicrous."</p>

<p>President Trump on Tuesday shifted his position on whether Ukraine should hold out for all the territory seized by Russia, saying on social media that he thinks Ukraine is in a position to win it all back.</p>
<p>It's a reversal from his long-held position that Kyiv would need to give up some of its territory to Moscow to end the war – such as Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.</p> <p>But now, "after getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation," Trump said he believes Ukraine – backed by the European Union and NATO – can win back all its territory.</p> <p>"Why not?" he said in a post after he met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, even suggesting that Ukraine could "maybe even go further than that!"</p>
<p>The reversal is the latest example of how Trump has swung between deference, frustration and indirect threats against Russia. Early in his second term, Trump boasted that his close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin would help him broker a quick resolution to the conflict.</p> <p>But as the war dragged on, Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Putin. In July, during a meeting with the NATO Secretary General, Trump lashed out at Putin and announced that he was sending Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine.</p>
<p>As recently as last month – when Trump met Putin in Alaska to try to broker an end to the war – Trump had said he believed "some land-swapping" would take place. Zelenskyy has been resistant to that idea.</p>
<p>Afterward, Trump said the two countries needed to discuss "the possible exchanges of territory, taking into consideration the current line of contact. That means, the war zone."</p> <p>But since the Alaska talks, there have been no signs that Putin is willing to meet Zelenskyy. Russia has ramped up its strikes on Ukraine, and there have been a series of incursions by Russian military aircraft into NATO airspace in the month since the talks.</p> <p>Trump said he thinks NATO members should shoot down Russian aircraft in such cases. "Yes, I do," he said in answer to a question from a reporter.</p>
<p>Asked whether he would back up NATO allies if that happened, Trump said: "Depends on the circumstance, but you know we're very strong toward NATO."</p> <p>In his social media post, Trump said Russia looks like "a paper tiger" because the war has dragged on for so long, and said that the United States would continue to supply weapons to NATO. "Good luck to all!" Trump said.</p> <p>Trump has so far resisted calls for tougher sanctions, insisting that European leaders first need to stop buying oil from Russia, as well as apply steep tariffs for major buyers of Russian oil, like China.</p>
<p>In a pointed speech to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, Trump said it was inexcusable that some NATO members were still buying Russian energy. "Think of it: they're funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one?"</p> <p>Zelenskyy said he was hoping to see more sanctions on Russia, and said he supported Trump's push to get NATO members to stop buying Russian energy.</p> <p>Zelenskyy said he had spoken with Slovakia's prime minister who seemed open to cutting off its imports. "I'm not sure the Hungarians are ready," Zelenskyy said. Trump said he hasn't spoken to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban about it yet. "I had a feeling if I did, he might stop," Trump said.</p>

<div class="article-title">MLB will allow players to challenge balls and strikes starting in 2026</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Starting in the 2026 season, Major League Baseball players will be able to challenge called balls and strikes in regular and postseason games for the first time.</p>
<p>The widely expected adoption of the challenge system — which is powered by baseball's automated strike zone, known as ABS — was announced Tuesday after years of testing in the minor leagues and a major-league debut this year in spring training and the All-Star Game.</p> <p>The new system "[strikes] the right balance of preserving the integral role of the umpire in the game with the ability to correct a missed call in a high-leverage situation, all while preserving the pace and rhythm of the game," said MLB commissioner Rob Manfred in a press release.</p>
<p>Only batters, pitchers and catchers are allowed to challenge the umpire's call. The challenge, indicated by a player tapping his head, must be made immediately after the call of ball or strike. Afterward, an automated video will play on the scoreboard showing the location of the pitch and strike zone as detected by a series of 12 cameras placed around every ballpark.</p>
<p>Each team will begin each game with two challenges. If a call is overturned, the team retains that challenge; if a call is upheld, the team loses that challenge. Once a team loses both its challenges, no player can challenge any more calls.</p>
<p>Tayler Saucedo, a relief pitcher who played with the Seattle Mariners this season, says he's glad it's coming to the Major Leagues after some initial reluctance. "I was always anti ABS but after experiencing it this year this will be a great change and fans will love it as well," he posted on X. "Also felt it made umpires better. Doesn't slow down the game at all and it takes about in total 10 seconds." </p> <p>In spring training this year, players collectively challenged more than 1,000 balls and strikes. The umpire's calls were overturned just over half the time. Catchers, correct 56% of the time, were the most effective at challenging, and pitchers, at 41%, were the least. MLB reported that each challenge added around 14 seconds to the duration of a game.</p>
<p>Most MLB players have already experienced the ABS challenge system, whether in spring training this season or during their time in the minor leagues, where MLB has been testing ABS since 2021.</p> <p>John Stanton, the owner of the Seattle Mariners, called the system a "big step forward for the game."</p> <p>"ABS Challenge strikes the right balance of putting a tool in the players' hands to correct a missed call in a high leverage spot while retaining the human element of the game and adding a new fan-friendly engagement moment," said Stanton, who is also currently the chairman of MLB's joint competition committee, a rotating group of six team owners, four active players and one active umpire that votes on new rules.</p>
<p>Replay review has been part of baseball since 2008, when MLB first allowed the use of video to review home runs. Since then, replay review has widened to include many other types of calls, including force-outs on bases and whether fly balls were caught before touching the ground.</p> <p>Called balls and strikes, though, were long accepted as a "human element" of the game, even as technology made it easier to spot bad calls and increased the pressure on umpires. The pressure came both internally from league officials and externally from TV audiences and fans on social media, to standardize the zone and increase their accuracy.</p>
<p>The ABS system was created by Hawk-Eye, the company behind automated replay systems in other sports, including out-of-bounds calls in tennis and offside reviews in soccer. Over four seasons of testing in Minor League Baseball, officials collected feedback from players, umpires and fans. Then they made tweaks — first to the strike zone by lowering the height of the automated zone after players reported the system produced a taller zone than they expected.</p> <p>MLB also tried out a "full ABS" system in which the system fed umpires the call of every pitch, but players and fans alike reported preferring the challenge system. According to an internal MLB poll conducted last summer with Triple-A players and field staff, only 8 percent preferred the fully automated system, compared to 54% who preferred the challenges and 38% who preferred traditional human umpires.</p>
<p>"Throughout this process we have worked on deploying the system in a way that's acceptable to players," said Manfred. "The strong preference from players for the Challenge format over using the technology to call every pitch was a key factor in determining the system we are announcing today."</p>

<div class="article-title">When it comes to Tylenol, what are parents to do?</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Headache? Sore back? Bad cold? In the past, many Americans would reach into their medicine cabinets and pull out acetaminophen, known by the brand-name Tylenol, without any concern at all. It's long been a staple of home medicine, seen as a safe way to treat pain and fever in pregnancy as well as in childhood, when used as directed. But President Trump has come out swinging against this common over-the-counter drug, blaming it for rising cases of autism in recent years.</p> <p>"Don't take Tylenol if you're pregnant, and don't give Tylenol to your child," Trump said in a White House briefing, emphatically repeating this warning more than a dozen times. "Fight like hell not to take it."</p>
<p>Physician groups, plus the maker of Tylenol, immediately pushed back on the president's stance, saying it just wasn't supported by the research — and could have serious repercussions for women and babies.</p> <p>All of this means that many parents and would-be parents, plus others who sometimes take acetaminophen, are suddenly wondering what they should think about this old mainstay of medicine, and whether they truly need to be concerned.</p> <h3 class="edTag">What have research studies actually found?</h3> <p>Researchers have spent years trying to tease out any links between autism and acetaminophen, but the evidence is uncertain, according to the Food and Drug Administration's new warning sent to physicians. It noted that while some studies have found an association between use of this drug and development of autism in children, other studies have come to the opposite conclusion.</p>
<p>One reason such research is difficult is that parents may not remember, or may misreport, how much of the drug they actually took during pregnancy. That's why researchers were particularly interested in one 2019 study in the journal JAMA Psychiatry that made objective measurements of drug levels in umbilical cord blood in nearly a thousand mother-and-child pairs. It found that children with the highest levels of acetaminophen in their cord blood were roughly three times more likely to be diagnosed with autism or ADHD later on, compared with kids that had the lowest levels in their cord blood. However, the lead researcher was careful to note that the study did not show that the drug <em>caused</em> those disorders — just that there was an association.</p>
<p>Another influential study, one of the largest and best controlled, was published in 2024, and it analyzed the records of over two million children in Sweden. It initially found a small link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism. But the researchers knew that genes have a powerful effect on autism risk, and they wanted to control for this. Since siblings share genes and also other commonalities such as the same home environment, they did an analysis that compared siblings who had been exposed to acetaminophen with those who had not. And when they did that, the link between autism and acetaminophen disappeared.</p>
<p>"In other words, the association was not a causal one, and it was most likely due to other factors like genetics, infections, fevers, that sort of thing," Brian Lee of Drexel University, one of the study's authors, said in an interview with NPR's Allison Aubrey.</p> <p>So far, he says, the evidence largely suggests that acetaminophen does not cause autism.</p> <p>"I wouldn't say that the chapter is closed on this by any means, but certainly the mound of evidence from the best studies to date points to no causal effect of acetaminophen on autism."</p> <p>One researcher whose work has suggested that the drug may increase the risk of autism is epidemiologist Ann Bauer of the University of Massachusetts. She told NPR's Jon Hamilton that the "case is still open" on acetaminophen. She thinks that while expectant parents should be told about a potential risk, they should also be told there's real uncertainty about that risk.</p> <p>She also thinks it's<strong> t</strong>oo soon for the government to be offering guidance on the use of this drug and how that might be related to autism.</p> <p>"I think they may be jumping the gun," she said. "I think those of us in the research community would like to see stronger evidence."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Why not just avoid Tylenol altogether in pregnancy?</h3> <p>President Trump said repeatedly that there was "no downside" to not taking acetaminophen and that women should just try to tough it out. But experts in maternal-fetal medicine say that untreated fever is known to be dangerous in pregnancy, and pain is a problem too.</p> <p>The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine has pointed out that "untreated fever, particularly in the first trimester, increases the risk of miscarriage, birth defects, and premature birth."</p> <p>Untreated pain, meanwhile, can be linked to depression and high blood pressure. Nicole Baldwin, MD, a pediatrician from Cincinnati, Ohio, told NPR's Allison Aubrey that "I remember when I was pregnant with my daughter, I had an injury. I fell in mid-pregnancy. And if I hadn't had Tylenol to take, I can't imagine the suffering I would have had for two months."</p> <p>"There are no other medications that these pregnant women can take," Baldwin said, as other pain and fever reducing drugs have been proven unsafe in pregnancy. Ibuprofen, for example, has been linked to kidney problems in fetuses.</p> <p>"Acetaminophen is one of the few options available to pregnant patients to treat pain and fever," the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement following the president's press conference. "When considering the use of medication in pregnancy, it's important to consider all potential risks along with any benefits."</p> <p>And that's basically what the FDA told physicians this week, saying that while "clinicians should consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy for routine low-grade fevers," this had to be balanced with the fact that acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter option in pregnancy against fever and pain.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Who should parents trust on these issues?</h3> <p>Worried parents might wonder how they're supposed to make decisions when the research community might debate autism and acetaminophen for years to come.</p>
<p>"Who has time to sit there and go through the dozens or hundreds of scientific articles on any given topic?" sympathizes Lee. "We trust our experts. And if our experts are telling us one thing, but other experts are saying another thing, it causes confusion."</p> <p>"I would say, what parents need to do is to step back and think about who they are hearing the messages from," Helen Tager-Flusberg, director of Boston University's Center for Autism Research Excellence, told NPR's Michel Martin. "Are they going to listen to people who are not physicians, who have no expertise in autism, or are they going to turn to their medical providers, their treatment providers and ask them what their view of the current science is? That's what they should be doing."</p> <p>Baldwin, the pediatrician in Cincinnati, likes to explain that any association that's been seen between autism and acetaminophen in studies doesn't necessarily mean there's a causal relationship. Both shark attacks and eating ice cream increase in summer, she says, but that doesn't mean that one causes the other.</p> <p>"These studies that have been out show correlation, but don't actually show causation," says Baldwin." "And I think that's an important thing for parents to realize — that the science is not known just yet, despite what has been said."<br/></p>
