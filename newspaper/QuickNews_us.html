<div class="article-title">Trump, Democrats locked in endless cycles of payback after Comey indictment and targeting president's enemies</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Let’s roll back the clock.</p><p>After the 2020 election, Donald Trump found himself the target of multiple investigations.</p><p>The flimsiest, and most partisan, was brought by Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, who somehow elevated the Stormy Daniels payoffs from a misdemeanor to a felony, and got a conviction.</p><p>Then there was Jack Smith, who launched two investigations — one involving classified documents, the other on allegations related to Jan. 6.</p><p>And in Georgia, Fulton County DA Fani Willis investigated Trump’s famous phone call to Brad Raffensperger — "I just want to find 11,780 votes" — and some of Trump’s lawyers, such as Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis, pleaded guilty.</p><p>Beyond that, New York AG Letitia James filed a civil suit about inflated property values that led to a fine that has since grown to half a billion dollars — a penalty so outrageous that an appeals court threw it out on grounds of cruel and unusual punishment.</p><p>And what was the mindset of the media, the Democrats and at least half the country at that time?</p><p>It was that Trump had done a lot of bad things, and if he could be successfully prosecuted before the 2024 election, he could be knocked out of the race. </p><p>But from Trump’s point of view, these were bogus cases brought by biased prosecutors — James had won election by vowing to go after him — and backed by unfair judges for the sole purpose of keeping him out of the White House.</p><p>Joe Biden may have kept hands off — Jack Smith was named special counsel by AG Merrick Garland — but to the president it was all a grand left-wing conspiracy.</p><p>And that’s why Trump feels entitled to payback.</p><p>That’s why James Comey was just indicted, with Trump firing his own U.S. attorney who believed there wasn’t enough evidence, replacing him with a loyalist whose job was to charge the former FBI director.</p><p>That’s why Tish James is now under investigation for alleged mortgage fraud, </p><p>That’s why the Trump DOJ has just subpoenaed Fani Willis’ travel records from last year, and is investigating Sen. Adam Schiff.</p><p>To Donald Trump, this is all fully justified payback.</p><p>But he’s doing exactly what was done to him — going after political enemies — and doing it out in the open. He has ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue these cases, and fast, which is weaponizing the Justice Department against those he despises, in a way that no previous president has ever done. </p><p>He pronounces these targets "guilty as hell" — that alone would be a scandal in any other administration for prejudicing a trial — and celebrates the unveiling of indictments, such as calling Comey a "sick person," a "Dirty Cop" and a "SLIMEBALL."</p><p>So how does Trump justify doing what was done to him? He doesn’t. He’s never been big on consistency. And his MAGA base supports him no matter what.</p><p>Keep in mind that the perjury allegation — based on a vague exchange about a leak to the Wall Street Journal about the Clinton Foundation, ironically — was investigated by special counsel John Durham in the first term, and by the DOJ’s inspector general, and neither brought charges.</p><p>When Erik Seibert, the U.S. attorney in Virginia’s Eastern District, found insufficient evidence to charge Comey, Bondi pushed back in defense of the 15-year veteran, Still, Trump replaced him with White House aide and onetime beauty queen Lindsey Halligan, his former lawyer, who has never tried a criminal case. Halligan couldn’t even find the courtroom, and no prosecutor in the office agreed to accompany her, as is customary. Doesn’t matter. She had one job.</p><p>"My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump," Comey said in a video.</p><p>Fourteen of the 23 grand jurors backed the two charges, just over the required minimum, and the jurors dismissed a proposed third count.</p><p>National Review’s Andy McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor, called the indictment "so ill-conceived and incompetently drafted, he should be able to get it thrown out on a pretrial motion to dismiss."</p><p>Dan Abrams, ABC’s chief legal analyst (and founder of Mediaite) said on "This Week": "I don’t even think that many in the Trump administration believe they’re going to get a conviction. I think that there’s a 95 percent-plus chance that there won’t be a conviction. That it’ll either get dismissed by a judge, there’ll be a hung jury, there’ll be an acquittal. But I’m not certain that that’s the end goal here." </p><p>In other words, making Comey’s life miserable and forcing him to pay legal fees may be satisfying enough.</p><p>Schiff, for his part, called the mortgage fraud allegation against him "the kind of stuff you see tinpot dictators do." .</p><p>But there’s a larger issue here than the culpability of Comey and the others. As a former Justice Department reporter, I know all too well that presidents are not supposed to intervene in criminal investigations, and that dates to a series of post-Watergate reforms after Richard Nixon’s attorney general went to prison.</p><p>But Trump does all this out in the open. There’s no need to rely on unnamed sources. When he issued a memo demanding investigations of his foes, he made it public. </p><p>"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility," the president wrote on Truth Social. He complained that "nothing is being done," demanding that Bondi investigate Coney, James and Schiff. And now he’s talking about targeting Democratic donor and activist George Soros.</p><p>The president also has a knack for letting his allies off the hook. After New York Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on corruption charges, Trump ordered the case dropped. Then he tried to lure Adams out of the race by offering him a job, to boost the chances of defeating the man he calls "Communist" Zohran Mamdani. Adams, stuck in single digits, just dropped out, and don’t be surprised if he winds up as an ambassador.</p><p>When a deranged shooter in Michigan opened fire during a Mormon church service, and set the place on fire, killing at least four people, before being shot to death, Trump called it "horrendous" and called Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the killer hated Mormons.</p><p>The president called it "another targeted attack on Christians."</p><p>What Trump and Leavitt neglected to mention is that the murderer has a Trump/Vance sign in front of his house.</p><p>So despite the president’s insistence that left-wingers are responsible for virtually all political violence, here’s a case where a right-winger, and Trump fan, is responsible for cold-blooded mass murder. But one day there will a Democrat in the White House again, ready to use the same tactics unleashed by Trump.</p><p>Dartmouth professor Brendan Nyhan, who heads a watchdog group, told the New York Times: "Do Republicans want to give President AOC unilateral powers to determine which Defense Department programs she wants to fund?"</p><p>His forthcoming report says "50 percent of Democrats now support restricting or shutting down Fox News, up from 37 percent in 2021." I would find that chilling, even if I didn’t work at Fox. Where is it written that the government should be shutting down news outlets?</p><p>The larger point is this: Trump believes he’s entitled to payback because of all the indictments aimed at him. The Democrats believe Trump has shattered the wall that protected criminal probes from White House interference. And so we plunge into an endless cycle of retribution, with each administration investigating the previous one and justifying it as getting even for their own mistreatment. </p><p>: <i>The news conference that President Trump was going to hold with </i><i>Bibi Netanyahu</i><i> yesterday turned into a non-conference when Trump, of all people, refused to take questions — not even the traditional two from each side. So they each gave lengthy speeches and left.</i></p><p><i>But the president achieved something remarkable. He got Bibi to go along with his plan to end the </i><i>war in Gaza</i><i>. Trump even said he’d personally head a peace board designed to protect Israel’s security, that Hamas would release the remaining hostages, and mentioned Oct. 7.</i></p><p><i>Honestly, it was probably shrewd not to be distracted by questions.</i></p><p><i>Here’s the problem: </i><i>Hamas</i><i> hasn’t agreed to anything yet, and has stuck by its insistence on a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces before any hostages are released. So the terrorist group is unlikely to agree.</i></p><p><i>If Hamas rejects the plan, Netanyahu said, "Israel will finish the job by itself."</i></p><p><i>Then he said, "we can do this the easy way or the hard way" — apparently unaware that was the much-condemned line that FCC Chairman Brendan Carr used to threaten action against </i><i>Jimmy Kimme</i><i>l.</i></p><p><i>Bibi also demanded an end to "incitement by the media," as if he or anyone else could tell the press what to do.      </i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry says he has formally requested federal assistance (RFA) to activate up to 1,000 Louisiana National Guard personnel under Title 32.</p><p>Landry announced his intentions during an appearance on "Hannity" Monday evening, stating his request for federal assistance had been submitted to Secretary of War Pete Hegseth.</p><p>Landry cited "ongoing public safety concerns regarding high crime rates throughout the state," adding that local law enforcement is overwhelmed by the number of homicides, carjackings and gang violence that "significantly exceed the national average."</p><p>He also says manpower shortages have been compounded by hurricanes and other natural disasters, causing the already thin police force to be stretched to its breaking point.</p><p>Louisiana faces "a convergence of elevated violent crime rates in Shreveport, Baton Rouge and New Orleans coupled with critical personnel shortages within local law enforcement," according to Landry.</p><p>The additional Guard support is expected to "supplement law enforcement presence in high-crime areas, provide logistical and communication support, and secure critical infrastructure."</p><p>Under Title 32 authority, they would patrol high-crime neighborhoods, bolster police presence in Baton Rouge, New Orleans and Shreveport, while securing critical infrastructure.</p><p>In the past, deployments of the National Guard have proven effective, Landry said, pointing to a 50% drop in crime during Mardi Gras and other major events earlier this year.</p><p>According to USA Facts, Louisiana ranks among the nation’s most dangerous states consistently. In 2024, for every 100,000 people, there were 520 violent crimes and 2,296 property crimes. Compared to the U.S. average, the violent crime rate in 2024 in Louisiana was 44.8% higher, and its rate of property crime was 30.5% higher.</p><p>Although not everyone is on board, as local officials in Shreveport and New Orleans have voiced concerns, Landry insists the crisis demands urgent action.</p><p>His request is now in Washington, leaving the fight over Louisiana’s safety in the hands of Hegseth, who will decide whether the support is necessary.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">DOJ lawsuit claims Minnesota sanctuary policies allow 'dangerous criminals' to avoid removal</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Minnesota over its sanctuary policies that the Trump administration says interfere with the federal government’s enforcement efforts on illegal immigration. </p><p>The complaint, filed Monday, names the State of Minnesota, Hennepin County, Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna S. Witt, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, and the Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, as defendants. </p><p>The complaint argues that not only are sanctuary policies illegal under federal law, but lead to the release of dangerous criminals who would otherwise be subject to removal, including illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes. </p><p>"Minnesota officials are jeopardizing the safety of their own citizens by allowing illegal aliens to circumvent the legal process," Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. "This Department of Justice will continue to bring litigation against any jurisdiction that uses sanctuary policies to defy federal law and undermine law enforcement."</p><p>Saint Paul characterized the lawsuit as an effective attack on the city’s "long-standing separation ordinance – an essential policy that promotes public safety, builds community trust, and reflects Saint Paul’s commitment to serving and protecting all residents regardless of immigration status." </p><p>"City employees don’t work for the president, we work for the people who live here. We will stand with our immigrant and refugee neighbors no matter how many unconstitutional claims the White House makes," St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said in a statement. "We’ve proven our resolve in two successful court actions already this year, and we look forward to winning our third legal victory in a row against this embarrassing federal regime." </p><p>Monday’s complaint comes after Attorney General Bondi last month published a list of sanctuary jurisdictions that included Minnesota. Boston, New York City, New Jersey, Colorado and Los Angeles were among the other jurisdictions included.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Ellison, Hennepin County, Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna S. Witt, and the City of Minneapolis for comment. </p><p>The Trump Justice Department filed similar lawsuits against the cities of New York and Los Angeles over the summer as well as Boston earlier this month. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Denver Broncos got back in the win column, handling the Cincinnati Bengals, 28-3, at home on Monday night.</p><p>The Broncos and Bengals are now 2-2 through the first four weeks of the season, though the latter isn’t looking too hot after yet another brutal offensive performance with backup quarterback Jake Browning at the helm for the injured Joe Burrow. </p><p>Browning was just 14-of-25 for 125 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions in a performance that came after just 10 points scored in a loss to the Minnesota Vikings this past week – his first filling the starting role for Burrow. </p><p>Credit has to go to the Broncos’ defense, though, as they were able to sack Browning three times and force nine straight third-down stops against the Bengals to end the season. Cincinnati was just 2-of-11 on third down, with the only two successful ones coming on the opening drive.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bo Nix and the Broncos’ offense looked good at home on Monday night, as Nix went 29-of-42 for 326 yards with two touchdown passes and one interception.</p><p>The Bengals got on the board first with an opening-drive field goal, but it was the Broncos who found the end zone first thanks to Nix taking it himself from six yards out on third-and-5 for a rushing score just before the end of the first quarter. </p><p>Nix clearly found the rhythm as the Broncos would follow up that first touchdown with another, this time allowing Marvin Mims’ speed to show out with a 16-yard rush on a jet sweep. Courtland Sutton also added a key 22-yard reception on third-and-4 to keep that drive alive before Mims’ stellar run. </p><p>Sutton would find the end zone himself as well, with Nix firing a dart from 20 yards away for the touchdown with eight seconds left to play in the first half. </p><p>A 21-3 lead for the Broncos at halftime could’ve been worse if Nix wasn’t intercepted on fourth-and-1 from the Cincinnati two-yard line with two minutes remaining in the second quarter. But it was a turnover that ultimately didn’t hurt the Broncos due to the Bengals’ ineptitude on offense. </p><p>Star wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase was even seen going up to head coach Zac Taylor during the second half clearly frustrated as the offense couldn’t put anything together. </p><p>Denver ended up capping their victory with an easy touchdown for rookie running back R.J. Harvey on a lofted 12-yard connection to make it 28-3. </p><p>While Harvey scored, it was veteran running back J.K. Dobbins being the first player to rush for 100 yards or more for the Broncos in the last 38 games, dating back to Latavius Murray in January 2023. He finished with 101 yards on 16 carries. </p><p>Sutton finished the game leading the Broncos with 81 receiving yards on five catches, while Mims had six grabs for 69 yards. </p><p>For the Bengals, the Broncos' defense held both Chase and Tee Higgins to a combined eight catches and 55 yards. Cincinnati also had more penalties called on them than first downs, so Taylor must get things in order heading into a game against the hot Detroit Lions next week.</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Former DOGE staffer Edward Coristine describes brutal D.C. attack by teen gang: 'Bunch of punches'</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former DOGE staffer Edward Coristine appeared on "Jesse Watters Primetime" on Monday to discuss the brutal attack that left him injured earlier this summer.</p><p>Coristine was assaulted at about 3 a.m. by a group of teenagers in Washington’s Logan Circle neighborhood on Aug. 3. Last week, a 15-year-old from Hyattsville, Maryland, pleaded guilty in juvenile court to felony assault, simple assault, robbery and attempted robbery in connection with the incident.</p><p>Speaking to Fox News Channel host Jesse Watters, Coristine said that he was hanging out with his friend group shortly before the attack.</p><p>"I was walking one of my friends back to her car, and as we're walking to the car, there's a group of 10 guys right across the street," Coristine recalled. "They start shouting at us. And really quickly, I knew something was really off about the situation."</p><p>The 19-year-old said that he rushed his female friend into the driver's seat, and she locked herself in the car before the attack began.</p><p>"They're just a few feet away and they slammed me against the car," Coristine said. "They started throwing a bunch of punches. I keep my hands up…luckily, the whole thing didn't last too long."</p><p>"The police showed up pretty quickly, so I was very fortunate I only came out with a broken nose and a concussion," he added. "It could have been a lot worse."</p><p>When asked what inspired him to move to Washington, D.C. and work for DOGE, Coristine said that he felt a "great responsibility to serve my country."</p><p>"My grandfather was this KGB double agent for the Americans, and he died so that I could come here and live in this free country that I love so much," the teenager said. </p><p>"And so when I started seeing these problems….like this $37 trillion national debt and counting…I was like, wow, this is insane. Is there any way that I can help solve this? And in this administration, there was a chance. So of course, when I saw the opportunity, I signed right up."</p><p>President Donald Trump reacted to the assault shortly after it was reported in August, calling D.C. crime "totally out of control."</p><p>"Local ‘youths’ and gang members, some only 14, 15, and 16-years-old, are randomly attacking, mugging, maiming, and shooting innocent citizens, at the same time knowing that they will be almost immediately released," Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p><p>"They are not afraid of Law Enforcement because they know nothing ever happens to them, but it’s going to happen now!"</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Peter Pinedo contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Darren Waller puts on vintage performance to help Dolphins grab first win of 2025 season</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Darren Waller turned back the clock on Monday night to help the Miami Dolphins vanquish the New York Jets, 27-21.</p><p>The one-time Pro Bowl tight end appeared in his first game for the Dolphins in the 2025 season after taking a year off from football following a stint with the New York Giants. He looked like his old self as he was able to carve up the Jets’ defense multiple times.</p><p>Waller caught two touchdown passes in a single game for the first time since he was with the Las Vegas Raiders in December 2020. He had his first touchdown catch since October 2023 when he was still with the Giants.</p><p>The first touchdown catch came in the second quarter. Tua Tagovailoa found a way to get the Dolphins into the red zone thanks to a creative flip to Malik Washington and easy throws to Tyreek Hill.</p><p>The second touchdown capped off a six-play, 36-yard drive in the third quarter. Tagovailoa found Waller for a 9-yard touchdown catch.</p><p>It had taken a bit for Waller to get back into game shape as he had been out of the league for more than a year. But, at least on Monday, the chance the Dolphins took on Waller paid off.</p><p>It wasn’t all smiles for the Dolphins.</p><p>Miami took a hit in the third quarter when Hill suffered a gruesome knee injury. Multiple reports indicated that the team feared he had dislocated his knee. If confirmed, it’s likely that he would be out for the remainder of the season.</p><p>Tagovailoa was 17-of-25 with 177 yards with the two touchdown passes. Running back De’Von Achane ran for 99 yards and a score.</p><p>Hill had six catches for 67 yards before he exited the game. Waller had three catches for 27 yards.</p><p>The Jets tried to get back into the game.</p><p>Justin Fields needed a miracle on 4th-and-1 in the third quarter. He was being chased around by the Dolphins defense and was able to avoid would-be tacklers to find a hole and burst through it. He scampered for a 43-yard touchdown to put some pressure on Miami.</p><p>The Jets nearly had a touchdown on a pass from Fields to Garrett Wilson. However, Wilson was called for offensive pass interference and it negated the score. New York had to settle for the field goal.</p><p>Wilson made up for it later in the night with an incredible catch and narrowly keeping himself in bounds.</p><p>But it was frustrating scenes for the Jets for the entire night.</p><p>New York committed 13 penalties for 101 yards along with three turnovers. Those penalties ultimately destroyed any momentum the offense would build up.</p><p>Fields was 20-of-27 with 227 passing yards and the touchdown pass to Wilson. He also led the team with 81 rushing yards.</p><p>Wilson finished with six catches for 82 yards.</p><p>The Jets have now lost 10 straight to the Dolphins in Miami.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A comet traveling outside the solar system and heading toward the Earth is much larger than scientists first believed, a scientist has detailed in a new report.</p><p>Avi Loeb claims the comet could even be an artifact of alien technology rather than a natural body because it weighs more than 33 billion tons and spans at least 3.1 miles across.</p><p>The object, named 3I/ATLAS, is only the third interstellar visitor ever detected, after Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. </p><p>The astrophysicist also revealed in a Medium blog post that new data and measurements indicate the comet’s nucleus is more massive than first estimated.</p><p>3I/ATLAS was spotted in July with observations showing the comet is shedding huge amounts of carbon dioxide and dust as it races toward the Sun. </p><p>Loeb and his colleagues calculated a slight "non-gravitational acceleration" in its movement caused by "outgassing" which suggests the object must be far heavier than early models assumed.</p><p>The comet dwarfs Oumuamua, just a quarter-mile long, and Borisov, about 0.6 miles across. </p><p>"This makes 3I/ATLAS three to five orders of magnitude more massive than the previous two interstellar objects we’ve observed," Loeb wrote in his post.</p><p>Next week the comet will pass within 1.67 million miles of Mars’ orbit while also coming close to both Jupiter and Venus. </p><p>Loeb has urged NASA to turn the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter towards the object and said that even a single bright pixel could fine tune estimates of its true dimensions.</p><p>"We should not decide about the nature of 3I/ATLAS based on the chemical composition of its skin," Loeb wrote. </p><p>"For the same reason, we should not judge a book by its cover," he added.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Dolphins star Tyreek Hill carted off field after gruesome knee injury, rushed to hospital</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Miami Dolphins star wide receiver Tyreek Hill was taken to a local hospital after suffering a gruesome knee injury on Monday night against the New York Jets. </p><p>Hill needed to be carted off the field in the third quarter after his left leg buckled in awkward fashion as he was making a catch near the sideline. The ESPN broadcast showed a replay of the action. Hill’s leg was bent in a direction it shouldn’t have been, to put it simply. </p><p>Both medical staffs for the Jets and Dolphins made their way quickly to Hill, who was put into an air cast and placed on the back of a cart. He was seen smiling almost out of disbelief as the Dolphins crowd at Hard Rock Stadium cheered for their speedy wide receiver, who acknowledged them as the cart drove to the tunnel. </p><p>Hill was quickly ruled out of the game with what the Dolphins called a knee injury. Head coach Mike McDaniel confirmed after the Dolphins 27-21 win that Hill dislocated his knee. </p><p>He will remain in the hospital overnight, though he said Hill had an upbeat attitude despite what the future for this season at least holds. </p><p>A dislocated knee usually means that other ligaments were torn in the process, which would effectively end Hill’s season. The Dolphins will await a definitive diagnosis there, but it’s likely Hill’s cleat won’t be on anytime soon. </p><p>"He is being taken to a local hospital for imaging, evaluation and observation," the Dolphins’ statement on X read. </p><p>Hill and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa were on the same page in this game, as No. 10 caught six passes for 67 yards to lead the Dolphins in that category before his injury. </p><p>Considering the seriousness of the injury, Hill’s 2025 season could be over. He has just 15 catches for 198 yards with one touchdown over four games this year. </p><p>The Dolphins came into this game against their AFC East foe struggling with an 0-3 record, as Mike McDaniel’s offense hadn’t been its usual electric self. </p><p>Hill had a slow start to the 2025 campaign, catching just four passes for 40 yards in a blowout loss to the Indianapolis Colts. He looked like his normal self, though, when he had 109 yards on six grabs in Week 2 against the New England Patriots. </p><p>Hill scored his first touchdown of the season last week on "Thursday Night Football" against the Buffalo Bills, where he had five catches for 49 yards.  </p><p>Hill is in his 10th NFL season, his fourth with the Dolphins after six with the Kansas City Chiefs.</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Local California women’s rights activist Beth Bourne protested the policy allowing transgender students access to girls’ locker rooms by stripping down to a bikini at a local school board meeting.</p><p>Bourne, who chairs the Moms for Liberty in Yolo County, took part in the Davis Joint Unified School Board meeting on Sept. 18 where she highlighted school policies on locker room access.</p><p>"I’m a parent in the Davis Unified School District, and I’m here today to talk about the policies you have for the locker rooms in the junior high schools. So Emerson, Holmes, Harper Junior High. Right now, we require our students to undress for PE class. So I’m just going to give you an idea what that looks like when I undress," Bourne said before taking off her clothes to reveal a bikini.</p><p>She continued, "So right now, this school district is saying that, depending on a child’s transgender identity, that they can pick which bathroom they want. So we have, right now at this school district, we have children self-identifying into different bathrooms just based off of their—"</p><p>Bourne was interrupted by members of the board, who ordered her to stop. </p><p>"I’ve got to finish my comments. You are violating my First Amendment right," Bourne was heard saying.</p><p>When she pushed back, School Board Vice President Hiram Jackson called for a recess.</p><p>After about five minutes, the meeting resumed, and the board allowed Bourne to finish her comments. Bourne again began stripping down to a bikini. The board ordered another recess and resumed more than 30 minutes later, moving on to a new topic.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Bourne and the Davis Joint Unified School Board for comment.</p><p>Bourne told CBS News on Sept. 19 that she has attended the school board meetings every month for the past three years to address the locker room issue and felt she needed to take drastic measures to make her point.</p><p>"If the adults don't feel comfortable watching someone, and I'm a 50-year-old woman, how can they expect girls to feel comfortable doing that in the locker room?" Bourne said. "I thought I made a really good point."</p><p>Trustee Cecilia Escamilla-Greenwald told local news publication The Vanguard that the police were called after the second recess and that the board is considering next steps.</p><p>"We are going to be meeting about this, about what to do in such situations, and we’re going to, I know that our superintendent is going to be speaking with counsel to see what can be done because it’s very inappropriate for anybody to be coming before the board and behaving in such a manner.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>FIRST ON FOX: An illegal alien who left an obscenity-laden bomb threat to a member of Congress was arrested by ICE over the weekend, according to the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, the DHS said that Rigoberto Albizar-Martinez, a 58-year-old Cuban illegal living in Tampa, was arrested by ICE over the weekend as part of its efforts to crack down on the "worst of the worst" criminal illegal aliens.</p><p>DHS said that Albizar-Martinez threatened to bomb the office of Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla.</p><p>He was sentenced to a year in prison in May after being found guilty in December of leaving a "vulgar, racist, obscenity-laden voicemail" in which he threatened to plant a bomb in the congresswoman’s Tampa office, according to a statement by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida.</p><p>Local outlet WFLA reported that in his message, Albizar-Martinez said in Spanish, "I’m going to plant a bomb in your office. It’s a threat," and "It’s a threat, so take it however you want you son of a f****** b****."</p><p>The outlet also reported that in the same message, Albizar-Martinez also attacked Democrats, black people and pro-Palestinian people.</p><p>Commenting on his arrest by ICE, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Fox News Digital that "there is no place for political violence in America."</p><p>"Rigoberto Albizar-Martinez threatened to bomb a Congresswoman’s office," said McLaughlin. "Thanks to the brave men and women of ICE, this illegal alien and national security threat will be out of our country.</p><p>"Nothing will deter us to remove the worst of the worst from America communities," she added.</p><p>Castor did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.</p><p>This comes as many Democrats have criticized ICE agents for carrying out immigration enforcement operations, accusing them of racially profiling people, using "Gestapo tactics" and terrorizing communities.</p><p>DHS said that over the weekend, it also arrested several other criminal illegal aliens, including child rapists, gang members and a human smuggler.</p><p>Among those arrested was Jorge German Aglony, a Chilean illegal in California, who was convicted of inflicting pain and suffering on a dependent adult or elder, as well as receipt and possession of child pornography.</p><p>Another illegal arrested, Leonardo Velazquez-Marin, from Mexico, was also convicted of possession of child pornography in Dallas County, Texas. Also in Texas, ICE arrested Jose Elias Mejia-Orellana, a Honduran national who was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child under 14 in Collin County.</p><p>In Maryland, ICE arrested another child predator, Melvin Guiakora, from Central African Republic, who was convicted for sexual solicitation of a minor in Washington County.</p><p>ICE also arrested a member of the Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion, Mexican national Adan Mares-Martinez, who was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon causing great bodily injury in Norwalk, California. </p><p>Another illegal, Elvin Humberto Madrigal-Calero, from Nicaragua, was arrested following a conviction of involuntary manslaughter in Pulaski County, Virginia. </p><p>In El Centro, California, Mexican national Oscar Morales-Valencia, was arrested by ICE following a conviction of bringing in and harboring aliens.</p><p>This comes shortly after DHS announced that two million illegal immigrants "have been removed or have self-deported" from the U.S. since Jan. 20, putting the Trump administration on pace to break records.</p><p>In less than 250 days, an estimated 1.6 million illegal immigrants have voluntarily self-deported, while 400,000 were removed by federal law enforcement, the DHS said last week, describing the situation as a "new milestone."</p><p>"Ramped-up immigration enforcement targeting the worst of the worst is removing more and more criminal illegal aliens off our streets every day and is sending a clear message to anyone else in this country illegally: Self-deport or we will arrest and deport you," said McLaughlin.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>An emotional speech from a grieving father led LIV Golf star Phil Mickelson to call out the justice system.</p><p>Mickelson saw the testimony by Stephen Federico at a House Judiciary Subcommittee meeting Monday in Charlotte, North Carolina, following the stabbing death of Iryna Zarutska on the city’s light rail less than two months ago.</p><p>Federico’s daughter, Logan, a 22-year-old aspiring teacher from Waxhaw, North Carolina, was visiting friends at the University of South Carolina when "career criminal" Alexander Dickey allegedly broke into a Cypress Street home on May 3 and shot and killed her.</p><p>Dickey had been arrested 39 times on 25 felonies. Federico shared his grief and explained why he continues to push for change in the legal system.</p><p>Mickelson was clearly moved, reposting Federico’s remarks on X with his own message.</p><p>"The judge(s) who let this person go should be held accountable and in jail," Mickelson wrote.</p><p>Federico’s testimony was raw and emotional.</p><p>"Think about your child coming home from a night out with their friends, laying down going to sleep, feeling somebody come into their room and wake them. Drag them out of bed, naked, force on her knees with her hands over her head, begging for her life," he said, fighting back tears.</p><p>"She was 5-foot-3, she weighed 115 pounds. Bang! Dead. Gone. Why? Because Alexander Devante Dickey, who was arrested 39 goddamn times, 25 felonies, was on the street. … You will be sick and tired of my face and my voice until this gets fixed. I will fight until my last breath for my daughter. Stop protecting the people that keep taking them from us … please. You have the power. We put you into power to do what you have to do. We’re asking you, we’re begging you all to stop this."</p><p>Federico later appeared on Fox News’ "The Ingraham Angle," where he explained his mission further.</p><p>"I’m fighting for Logan. I have to be Logan’s voice because nobody else will be. I don’t have anybody fighting for her justice. Somebody has to fight for the innocent people who are left here. We have to make some drastic changes in our system. People like Alexander Dickey should not be on the street — people know that," he said.</p><p>The Lexington County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that Dickey’s criminal record spanned eight agencies. He was booked 11 times between 2013 and 2025, facing multiple burglary and larceny charges. A first-degree burglary conviction in South Carolina carries a minimum 15-year prison sentence and up to life in prison.</p><p>Federico said the system gave Dickey more rights than his daughter ever had.</p><p>"They cared more about making sure he wasn’t put in prison than worrying about whether or not he was going to hurt somebody," he said. "His crimes escalated every time he made a new one. He finally graduated to the jackpot and executed our daughter. We’re still trying to hear from our South Carolina solicitor to see if he’s going to get the death penalty or not. Obviously, it checks all the boxes that it does.</p><p>"But they’re more concerned about keeping criminals out of the prisons and institutions than they are to try to rehabilitate them. You can’t rehabilitate some of these guys, it’s just impossible."</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said it was a "tragedy" that conservative activist Charlie Kirk was killed "in that way," and said there is no legacy to honor. </p><p>Omar spoke to former CNN anchor Don Lemon in which he asked her about criticism of her previous comments about Kirk and if she would apologize.</p><p>"Well, I have nothing to apologize for," Omar said. "You know, it is a tragedy that Charlie Kirk was killed in that way. I feel for his widow and his children. They will have to live with that for the rest of their lives."</p><p>She went on to condemn Kirk, arguing, "But there is no legacy to honor. It was a legacy filled with bigotry, hatred, and White supremacy. And as a Black woman and as a Muslim in this country, I refuse to join the chorus that changes the history of what is on the record from this man."</p><p>She argued that Kirk’s defenders can "do whatever they want to do, but I am not going to be bullied into complacency, into dishonoring who I am and what I stand for just to make them feel comfortable."</p><p>When asked for comment about her saying it was a "tragedy that Charlie Kirk was killed in that way," a spokesperson for Omar told Fox News Digital that the congresswoman has "clearly condemned" Kirk's murder and expressed condolences several times. </p><p>The spokesperson also accused right-wing outlets of making "disingenuous attempts" to twist the Squad member's words and put her life in danger. </p><p>Earlier in the interview, Omar argued that conservatives are eager to blame political violence on the left so they can use it as an excuse to crack down on them. </p><p>"I think to them it is easy to blame someone else. It is hard for them to face the fact that there is something wrong, and that they have to address it," she said. "If it is someone like you and I, then they could just be like, ‘Hey Black people, fix your problem.’ They never think about like, ‘Okay, there is a problem in this country where we have young White men who are picking up a gun, mass executing people, and we should talk about that.’ And that's not a conversation that they're interested in having because they rather focus on you and I."</p><p>Omar had previously been criticized for her condemnation of Kirk on a podcast to the extent she was hit with a House Ethics Committee complaint. </p><p>Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., forced a vote on censuring Omar over her reaction to Kirk's killing, but the move was quashed when four Republicans and all Democrats voted to table the measure.</p><p>Omar specifically faced backlash over an interview with progressive news outlet Zeteo, in which she criticized Kirk's past commentary and Republicans' reaction to the shooting. She later accused Republicans of taking her words out of context, and she called Kirk's death "mortifying."</p><p><i>Fox News' Elizabeth Elkind contributed to this article.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> A Florida-based multi-agency task force has seized a record one million pounds of cocaine during fiscal year 2025 — a haul officials say represents 378 million lethal doses, enough to kill every American.</p><p>The seizure was announced by Joint Inter-Agency Task Force – South (JIATF-S), led by U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). The unit, which includes the U.S. Coast Guard, works with partner nations to disrupt the flow of illicit drugs through the "transit zone" between South America, Central America and the Caribbean and to weaken transnational criminal organizations.</p><p>According to the task force, the amount of drugs seized over the past 12 months is enough to fill 42 dump trucks. The 2025 fiscal year ends Tuesday. </p><p>JIATF-S confirmed to Fox News Digital that the effort has denied cartels and narco-terrorists $11.34 billion in revenue and removed 377.9 million lethal doses from the streets.</p><p>JIATF-S operates across 42 million square miles, from the Eastern Pacific to the Western Atlantic, stretching from international waters north of the Caribbean Antilles to the southern tip of South America at Cape Horn.</p><p>The region has long been a major trafficking corridor for drugs, arms, cash and people. Well-financed and sophisticated criminal networks continue to exploit the area, officials said.</p><p>"By disrupting the flow of these deadly drugs, JIATF-S is saving lives and protecting our homeland," the agency added.</p><p>A seizure of this magnitude has never been accomplished before. Officials said the one million pounds of cocaine does not include the strikes on Venezuelan narco-terrorists.</p><p>The Trump administration has vowed to intensify military action in the Caribbean as part of its counter-narcotics strategy.</p><p>In recent months, U.S. forces have conducted multiple operations targeting smuggling vessels as President Donald Trump pushed to crack down on cartels and stem the flow of cocaine and other illicit drugs into the United States.</p><p>In February, Trump designated groups, including Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel as foreign terrorist organizations.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Jury selection has begun in the high-profile murder trial of Sarah Hartsfield, the Texas woman accused of killing her fifth husband with insulin. </p><p>The proceedings mark the latest chapter in a case that has gripped Texas as the 50-year-old faces accusations that she murdered her husband, Joseph Hartsfield, in January 2023. Hartsfield pleaded not guilty.</p><p>According to a grand jury indictment, filed in February 2023, prosecutors allege she "intentionally and knowingly cause[d] the death of an individual, namely Joseph Hartsfield, by a manner and means unknown to the grand jury." </p><p>Joseph's obituary says he died in a hospital "due to complications of an ischemic stroke, with his loving wife at his side." Hartsfield is currently in custody at the Chambers County Jail in Texas and is held on a reduced bond of $2 million. </p><p>Prosecutors allege that Hartsfield, an Army veteran, used her husband’s diabetes to cover up a homicide, allegedly injecting him with dangerous amounts of insulin and delaying calling 911 for several hours. </p><p>Joseph was taken to a hospital and died days later. Investigators later uncovered multiple insulin pens near his bedside and questioned inconsistencies in Hartsfield’s statements.</p><p>"I appreciate the hard work of the deputies and detectives who followed their instincts and identified the suspicious circumstances surrounding Mr. Hartsfield’s death that could have been labeled as ‘death due to illness’ instead of murder," Sheriff Brian Hawthorne said at the time of her arrest.</p><p>The defense has argued that Joseph’s death may have been a tragic complication of his own medical condition rather than a deliberate act by his wife. Part of what makes the case complex is Hartsfield’s marital history. The now 48-year-old has been married five times. </p><p>Hartsfield’s first marriage was to her high school sweetheart, Titus Knoernschild. The couple married young, but the relationship soon soured. Knoernschild told ABC13 Houston that Sarah threatened him during their separation, warning him not to be surprised if he didn’t survive their divorce. According to the local outlet, they divorced by 1995, but he said she continued to harass him for years afterward, including showing up at his Fort Hood office in 2008 until he obtained a no-contact order.</p><p>She went on to marry her second husband in the mid-1990s. According to ABC13, Sarah was arrested in March 1996 for allegedly assaulting him during a dispute at their Rio Bonito home. The charge was dropped after about a week, ABC13 reported.</p><p>By the late 1990s, Sarah had remarried, and her third marriage eventually ended in divorce in 2018. Around that time, she became engaged to David Bragg in Minnesota. On May 9, 2018, Sarah shot and killed Bragg in his home. She told investigators that he fired at her first and that she returned fire. Douglas County prosecutors ruled the killing a justifiable act of self-defense at the time, according to FOX9 Minneapolis. </p><p>Not long after Bragg’s death, Sarah married her fourth husband around 2019. That marriage also ended in divorce by 2021.</p><p>Sarah’s fifth marriage was to Joseph Hartsfield, whom she wed in 2022. Friends and neighbors told Click2Houston that Joseph was unhappy in the marriage and had been planning to leave. On Jan. 7, 2023, Joseph was found unresponsive after a diabetic emergency.</p><p>Prosecutors allege Sarah injected him with excessive insulin and delayed calling 911. He died days later. The Harris County Medical Examiner ruled the cause of death as complications from toxic insulin exposure.</p><p>In February 2023, Sarah was arrested and indicted for Joseph’s murder. </p><p>Her trial is scheduled to begin on Tuesday with opening statements after jury selection.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>After an illegal alien, Ian Andre Roberts, the superintendent of the Des Moines Public Schools in Iowa, was arrested by ICE, Republicans blew the whistle on the fact that he was a registered active Democrat voter in the state of Maryland.</p><p>According to the official website for the Maryland State Board of Elections, Roberts, who overstayed a student visa from 1999, has an active voter status and is registered as a Democrat in Maryland. The development was first reported on by columnist Dustin Grage.</p><p>Republican state Delegate Matt Morgan, who is chair of the Maryland House Freedom Caucus, told Fox News Digital that Roberts’ registration means that he is eligible to vote in all federal, state and local elections despite not being a U.S. citizen, and also despite likely not having lived in Maryland for the past decade.</p><p>Morgan explained that there is nothing in Maryland law allowing for non-citizens to be registered to vote in federal or state elections even if Roberts were still a legal resident.</p><p>Now, the House Freedom Caucus is demanding answers from the Maryland State Board of Elections about "gaping holes" in the state’s election integrity systems.</p><p>In a letter sent to the elections board on Monday, the Freedom Caucus also demanded answers on why the board has been "obstructing a valid request by the Department of Justice to ensure compliance with federal election laws, citing immigration enforcement as a primary concern.</p><p>Morgan pointed to a letter the elections board sent to the Justice Department in August in which State Administrator of Elections Jared DeMarinis expressed concern that if the board gave over voter information to the federal government that data would be used for "used for enforcement of immigration laws against Maryland residents."  </p><p>Commenting on the letter, Morgan asked, "If illegal aliens are not allowed to vote, why would they be on the voter rolls in the first place? And how would that enhance immigration enforcement? I don't know, but that's the excuse that they wrote to the DOJ."</p><p>"It's ridiculous," he went on, adding that "everyone reasonable wants a safe and secure election."</p><p>Before his arrest by ICE, Roberts headed the Des Moines Public Schools, the largest school district in the state, despite not being legally authorized to work in the U.S. after his employment authorization card expired in 2020, according to authorities.</p><p>He was taken into custody on a fugitive warrant last week. ICE agents arrested Roberts after he attempted to flee and was found hiding in brush. The vehicle Roberts was driving was found with $3,000 in cash, a fixed-blade hunting knife, and a loaded Glock 19 firearm, ICE said.</p><p>Roberts also had illegal weapons possession charges from 2020 and was given a final order of removal in 2024.</p><p>The state of Iowa revoked Roberts' education license on Sunday, triggering the Des Moines School Board to place him on unpaid leave.</p><p>"We were notified that the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked Doctor Roberts' license to practice as a superintendent in the state of Iowa. Without such a license, Doctor Roberts is not in compliance with his contract," said Jackie Norris, chair of the school board.</p><p>Morgan said that though Roberts’ case is baffling, he fears he may just be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to illegal aliens registered to vote in Maryland.</p><p>"We have no idea how widespread this is. We hear rumors, but we have no idea," he said.</p><p>"This is uncharted territory," he added.</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A blogger has blasted British police after they arrested him for sharing a meme on social media that read "F--- Hamas."</p><p>Pete North, 47, filmed officers arriving at his Yorkshire home in the U.K. on Sept. 25 and telling him he was being detained because he had "posted something on the internet" that a member of their hate crime team "didn’t appreciate." </p><p>The shocking footage shows an officer explaining that North was being arrested "on suspicion of publishing or distributing written material intended to stir up racial hatred."</p><p>The post in question had been shared by North on X in August and featured a Palestinian flag with the words: "F--- Palestine. F--- Hamas. F--- Islam. Want to protest? F--- off to Muslim country and protest."</p><p>North confirmed to The Telegraph that although the meme contained offensive references to Palestine and Islam, officers in the interview at the station appeared preoccupied with the part directed at Hamas.</p><p>"The officer in the interview said, ‘Well, firstly, let’s start with the meme. You posted a meme that said f--- Hamas,’" North recalled to the British outlet.</p><p>"I said, ‘yeah, I did post a meme that said f--- Hamas, because Hamas are a proscribed terrorist organisation internationally, including in Britain'."</p><p>He added: "I then asked him, ‘Just so we’re on the same page, you do know who Hamas are?’ And he just… shook his head. He looked totally blank. If you’re going to arrest people for memes, you probably need to pay more attention to current affairs."</p><p>North told The Telegraph he pressed the officer on whether he was aware of Hamas’s atrocities, including the murder of civilians on October 7. "He was totally oblivious," North claimed.</p><p>After being questioned for several hours, North was released without charge. </p><p>"I feel quite strongly that what political cartoons and memes I post on social media is none of the police’s business," North said.</p><p>"Nobody should be facing police inquiries for posting memes on Twitter. The whole point of this exercise is not to win convictions. It’s to terrorize people like me into thinking twice about posting spicy memes," he added.</p><p>North Yorkshire Police confirmed the arrest, telling UK media: "A 47-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of publishing or distributing written material intended to stir up racial hatred. He has been released under investigation while inquiries continue."</p><p><i>Fox News Digital has reached out to North Yorkshire Police for comment.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Twins fire manager Rocco Baldelli following worst season since 2016</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Minnesota Twins are moving on from manager Rocco Baldelli, who spent the last seven seasons leading the club.</p><p>Baldelli won three American League Central titles with Minnesota, but after back-to-back disappointing years, the team is heading in a new direction.</p><p>"This is a difficult day because of what Rocco represents to so many people here," Twins president Derek Falvey said in a statement. "He led with honesty, integrity, and an unwavering commitment to our players and staff. He gave himself fully to this role and I have tremendous respect and gratitude for the way he carried himself and the way he showed up every single day."</p><p>Minnesota was expected to contend again for the division crown, but finished 70-92. At the trade deadline, the Twins became major sellers, parting with players such as Carlos Correa, Harrison Bader, Willi Castro and Ty France.</p><p>The bullpen also took a major hit, with closer Jhoan Duran — dealt to the Philadelphia Phillies — headlining five relievers who were moved.</p><p>In total, Minnesota traded 10 players and cut $26 million in payroll. They went 19-35 after the deadline, their worst finish since 2016, and ended with MLB’s fourth-worst record.</p><p>Baldelli, 44, began his tenure strong, winning the 2019 AL Manager of the Year award as a rookie skipper. He also guided the Twins to a postseason win in 2023, snapping the club’s 18-game playoff losing streak and securing their first playoff series victory since 2002.</p><p>He finished with a 527-505 record over seven seasons.</p><p>The Twins also face challenges off the field. Attendance dropped to its lowest non-pandemic level since 2000, with just over 1.7 million tickets sold at Target Field.</p><p>Fans have expressed frustration with ownership. The Pohlad family began cutting costs after the promising 2023 season and put the franchise up for sale last year. In August, they reversed course, opting to retain majority control while bringing in new investors to help pay down debt.</p><p>"Over the past seven years, Rocco has been much more than our manager. He has been a trusted partner and teammate to me in leading this organization," Falvey said. "Together we shared a deep care for the Twins, for our players and staff, and for doing everything in our power to put this club in the best position to succeed."</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Martha Stewart says she was original trad-wife before modern social media trend emerged</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Martha Stewart was a trad-wife before the term took social media by storm.</p><p>During a recent appearance on Molly Sims' podcast, "Lipstick on the Rim," which she co-hosts with Emese Gormley, the 84-year-old businesswoman spoke about becoming one of the first female self-made billionaires in America, and how she was able to relate to "every woman."</p><p>"I was the every woman. I don't call housekeeping, I call it homekeeping," she explained. "I really was that woman. I now have a new term which I just learned, I was the trad-wife. I was the original f---ing trad-wife."</p><p>Short for "traditional wife," tradwives are women who honor femininity, care for their husbands, children and family, and value the state of their home more than they do a salary, yet are not subservient, according to the Darling Academy, a British website.</p><p>When it comes to being able to balance managing her home with managing her successful business, Stewart said it "was very easy."</p><p>"I was steeped in business from the stock market days and all the research that I had done on companies, but I was also so interested in homekeeping," she said. "That was the easy joining of two very diverse fields."</p><p>The lifestyle mogul started out as a caterer, who later found success as a cookbook author and television personality. She later consolidated all her businesses, including magazines, books, TV shows and products into her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.</p><p>Her company went public in 1999 and the stock price doubled on its first day on the market, valuing Stewart's 96% ownership stake in the company at about $1.05 billion, according to reports at the time.</p><p>"The day I went public, I was a very, very rich woman. And that was fun," she said. "I drove up Madison Avenue and I said, ‘Oh gosh, I could actually buy anything on this street.’"</p><p>In recent years, Stewart has embraced her sexuality as she started to post thirst traps on social media at 78, and even posed for Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Issue in 2023 at the age of 82. </p><p>She posted her first thirst trap in July 2020 and it went viral. The photo featured her in the Hamptons in a black bathing suit, as she pouted her lips towards the camera.</p><p>During an appearance on "Today" in September 2025, Stewart admitted "lots of people" have slid into her DMs since she began posting her thirst traps, but that she wasn't dating anyone at the time.</p><p>"No, I'm not dating anybody special," she said. "But I have lots of friends, and my friends keep me happy." </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>NBC’s long-running crime drama "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit" featured immigration officers blocking the police from investigating a rape by trying to arrest an illegal immigrant witness.</p><p>Thursday’s episode, "In the Wind," followed a building superintendent named Jorge Ruiz, played by Juan Francisco Villa, who becomes a key witness in identifying a rape suspect. However, Ruiz’s illegal status complicates matters after he flees an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid on his building because of his past as a convicted felon.</p><p>According to media watchdog NewsBusters, Ruiz was previously arrested on a "bogus charge" and only "got caught up in a drug sweep." He defends himself later in the episode to Captain Olivia Benson, played by Mariska Hargitay.</p><p>"I've been in this country for 22 years," Ruiz said. "I got a job. I—I'm really good at it. Paid my taxes. I send money back to my family. And I was arrested 15 years ago. But—but it was for something that I didn't do."</p><p>Benson attempts to convince Ruiz to stay and testify, but Ruiz expresses disdain at the idea of doing "something nice for [the] government."</p><p>"So my choices are to—to run and hide and hope that they never find me or to — to just leave my whole life and just go back. And now you're asking me to do something nice for my government? Why would I do that?" Ruiz said.</p><p>Benson protects Ruiz by placing him in police custody, though she is briefly arrested for interfering with a federal operation after ICE agents try to apprehend him at the precinct.</p><p>ICE agents tried again to arrest Ruiz during court proceedings before he could testify, only to be berated by the judge. </p><p>"No, not in my courtroom. Jimmy, tell them they can wait outside, but they are not welcome here," the judge said.</p><p>Ruiz is then granted a so-called "snitch visa" to stay in the U.S. legally as an informant.</p><p>The Trump administration blasted the show, accusing it of villainizing ICE agents. </p><p>"Not even a week ago, Our ICE law enforcement was shot up by a deranged lunatic who wanted to terrorize ICE and not even a week later <i>Law and Order: SVU‘s releases an episode that further</i> villainize our brave ICE law enforcement. NBC and Hollywood elites must stop fanning the flames of division," Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital. "Our ICE law enforcement work night and day to protect Americans, including by removing rapists and child molesters from America’s streets. Our officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them. This is irresponsible and pathetic."</p><p>"Law &amp; Order: SVU" has frequently touted its "ripped from the headline" storylines, though it has been criticized in recent years for having a left-leaning political slant.</p><p>In 2024, the show went viral after an episode featured a White rape victim refusing to testify against her attacker because she was concerned that he would not get a fair trial due to his race.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to NBC for comment. </p><p><i>The article was updated to include a statement from the Trump administration.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Jessica Simpson is bringing the heat.</p><p>The 45-year-old actress and singer posed in lingerie to announce the launch of her new line of intimates.</p><p>"When I’m wearin’ somethin’ sexy underneath, my days and nights are always filled with a secret surprise 😜," she wrote in the caption. "Everyone deserves to feel confident and beautiful! This is one of my best kept secrets that I am now happy to be sharin’ with y’all. Introducin’ the poetry of my wardrobe...my new line of @jessicasimpsonstyle brassieres and knickers at @walmart !!!"</p><p>In the announcement post, Simpson can be seen wearing a black lace bra with black and white detailing on the straps and matching underwear. In addition to a large blue ring, the singer also accessorized with a black long-sleeve cover-up.</p><p>"Beautiful. You are a shining Rockstar! ❤️," one fan wrote in the comments section. </p><p>Another added, "Such a beauty 😍," while a third chimed in with "You look AMAZING and we are so excited! 😍."</p><p>The pop icon recently made headlines when she shared photos from her 45th birthday celebration in July. In the carousel of photos, Simpson could be seen wearing a see-through dress with glittering mesh, layering her outfit with black underwear, which she sometimes paired with a satin black coat.</p><p>To celebrate her milestone birthday, the singer hosted her friends at Chateau Marmont, captioning her Instagram post, "Fancy dive into 45 💫✨💫."</p><p>In July, the "With You" singer shared on "Today" that she moved to Nashville in order to find a place where she can be herself, and that once there she found herself inspired to start singing and writing songs again. She initially put a pause on her singing career 15 years ago to focus on raising her three children.</p><p>"I went out to Nashville because that was the place [where] the songwriters — they’re not competitive," she explained. "They allow you to be yourself. Nothing you say is judged."</p><p>She also opened up about how returning to songwriting helped her heal from her separation from her estranged husband, former NFL player, Eric Johnson. The two tied the knot in July 2014 and announced their separation in January of this year, after 10 years of marriage.</p><p>Throughout their relationship, the couple welcomed three children: Maxwell, 13, Ace, 12, and Birdie, 6.</p><p>"I needed clarity — emotional clarity in general. I thought I was going to be doing this inspirational type of record, and it started leaning towards more, ‘How do I get through this moment?’ Because my whole life just completely changed while making this record … nothing that I would’ve expected. But there [are] blessings in the pain. You can find beauty in the pain."</p><p>"I want my daughters and my son to know that," she later added. "No matter what we go through in life, nothing can take us down. Nothing. As long as we are who we are, and we know our purpose … we’re guided by that."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">‘Yogurt Shop Murders’ investigators lay out how they solved killings of four teen girls</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>New DNA and ballistics testing have linked a serial killer to the 1991 "Yogurt Shop Murders," solving a case that has haunted Austin, Texas, for more than three decades.</p><p>During a news conference on Monday, the Austin Police Department announced that genetic evidence linked Robert Eugene Brashers to the killing of four teenage girls inside a North Austin yogurt shop.</p><p>"After 34 years, the Austin Police have made a significant breakthrough in one of the most devastating cases in our city’s history," said Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis. "This unthinkable crime has weighed heavily on the hearts of our community, the families of the victims and our detectives who have tirelessly pursued justice."</p><p>Investigators say a major breakthrough in the case came in recent weeks, when advanced testing revealed that DNA found beneath 13-year-old Amy Ayers’ fingernails matched that of Brashers — a man previously connected to homicides in both Missouri and South Carolina.</p><p>"I have never been so proud of my daughter in all of my life," her father, Bob Ayers, told the Austin American-Statesman. Authorities believe Ayers managed to gather the DNA during a desperate struggle with her attacker.</p><p>"Our whole family knew there was something about Amy that would help solve this," Ayers said.</p><p>He added, "This is over."</p><p>Brashers, who died by suicide during a 1999 standoff with Missouri police, had already been tied to a string of violent crimes across the country.</p><p>In 2018, officials in Missouri announced that DNA evidence connected Brashers to the 1990 strangulation of a woman in South Carolina, as well as the 1998 shootings of a mother and daughter in Missouri. He was also linked to the 1997 rape of a 14-year-old girl in Tennessee.</p><p>Then, in June, Jackson resubmitted ballistics data from a .380 caliber shell casing recovered at the yogurt shop to a federal database. The results matched an unsolved 1998 case in Kentucky. While Jackson declined to share details about the Kentucky case, he noted that it bore similarities to the Austin murders.</p><p>In August, South Carolina investigators informed Austin detectives that new DNA testing on a sample from under Amy Ayers’ fingernail matched Brashers — confirming his connection to the 1990 South Carolina murder.</p><p>"Amy’s final moments on this Earth were to solve this case for us," Jackson told The Courier of Montgomery County. "It’s because of her fighting back."</p><p>Police are still piecing together why Brashers was in Austin the night of the murders, but noted he was stopped near El Paso just two days later. He told police he was driving a stolen truck from Georgia to visit his father in Arizona.</p><p>A .380 caliber handgun found on Brashers during that stop was confiscated by police but later returned to his father — who may have given it back to him. Jackson said it was the same make and model Brashers used when he died by suicide during a 1999 standoff with Missouri police.</p><p>On Dec. 6, 1991, firefighters responding to a fire at the I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt store made a horrifying discovery: the bodies of Eliza Thomas, 17; sisters Jennifer, 17, and Sarah Harbison, 15; and Sarah’s best friend Amy Ayers, 13. </p><p>All had been shot in the head. Authorities believe the girls were bound, that some were sexually assaulted, and that the fire was intentionally set to destroy evidence.</p><p>The investigation faced major hurdles early on, as fire and water damage compromised much of the physical evidence. Thousands of tips poured in, but most led nowhere and no suspect was ever conclusively tied to the crime. The case eventually went cold.</p><p>For the families, decades of uncertainty became its own form of torture. Pam Ayers, Amy’s mother, told the Statesman that she is still trying to process the new revelations.</p><p>"I can’t say I am happy," she said. "I’m not there. I am kind of numb. Knowing it is a serial killer, I am not sure that makes it worse, but I would have never thought it would be a serial killer. That is hard for me to process."</p><p>While Brashers is long deceased, police say the investigation is ongoing. Detectives are working with agencies in other states to trace his movements and determine whether he is connected to additional unsolved crimes.</p><p>Austin Mayor Kirk Watson said he hopes the breakthrough may help the city move forward.</p><p>"My hopefulness is that we can turn a page as a community and hopefully the final page on this horror that marked a very different time in Austin’s history," Watson said. "We can take heart in our growth and progress and strength as a city. And we can go to sleep knowing that while the threat of this kind of evil may never pass in this world, we are far, far better able to prevent it before it happens and solve it when it does."</p><p>Authorities are urging anyone with information about Brashers to come forward.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The San Francisco Giants fired veteran manager Bob Melvin one day after the 2025 MLB regular season ended.</p><p>Melvin’s 2026 option was picked up in July, but the Giants opted to move in a different direction.</p><p>San Francisco finished 81-81 this year, hovering on the edge of playoff contention. Despite a 13-3 surge in August, the club faltered in September and slipped out of the race.</p><p>"After careful evaluation, we determined that making a change in leadership was in the best interest of the team," Buster Posey, the Giants’ president of baseball operations, said Monday, via ESPN. "The last couple of months have been both disappointing and frustrating for all of us, and we did not perform up to our standards. We now turn our focus to identifying a new leader to guide us forward.</p><p>"Just looking to find a different voice that can take us in a different direction."</p><p>Melvin acknowledged after San Francisco’s season-ending 4-0 win that he had no assurances about returning, despite his option being exercised.</p><p>The Giants are expected to move quickly to secure a new manager. One rumored candidate is Bruce Bochy, Posey’s former skipper in San Francisco, who just completed three seasons with the Texas Rangers.</p><p>"We talked about it a lot, what the standards are for the Giants, and we have high standards," Posey said. "And I hold myself to those same standards. I understand fully the position that I’m in now. My job and the team’s success is evaluated accordingly as well. Without a doubt, you hope there can be consistency in these leadership positions. We’ve got to get back to a place where we’re getting in the playoffs, we’re making runs in the playoffs. That’s what our fan base deserves, that’s what the city deserves."</p><p>Posey declined to put a timeline on the hire. "I want to make sure to get it right," he said.</p><p>Melvin’s extensive résumé means he could land elsewhere quickly. A three-time Manager of the Year in both leagues, he has a career record of 1,678-1,588 across 22 seasons with the Arizona Diamondbacks, Seattle Mariners, Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres and Giants.</p><p>He went 161-163 in two seasons with San Francisco.</p><p>"I feel extremely grateful that I get to play for him, and he’s the same guy every day," third baseman Matt Chapman said. "He’s been steady for us, he’s always honest with the players, he has our back. He’s done the best with what we’ve given him.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Lipscomb Academy, a K-12 private school affiliated with Lipscomb University, is working with students after complaints about how administrators handled efforts to honor conservative activist Charlie Kirk, after he was assassinated. </p><p>A Lipscomb Academy administrator, Jesse Savage, enforced a dress code policy asking students to remove the red ties they wore to honor Kirk, according to local news outlet The Tennessean.</p><p>"On Sept. 12, when 12-15 students wore red ties with their school uniforms to honor Kirk, Savage asked the students to remove the ties, leading to complaints, according to Lipscomb Academy in a Sept. 26 statement," The Tennessean reported.</p><p>A spokesperson for the school told Fox News Digital that no student was disciplined. </p><p>"To clarify, on Friday, Sept. 12, a small group of Academy students wore red ties to honor Charlie Kirk. While this was out of dress code, they were not disciplined but were asked to remove the ties," a spokesperson for the academy said. "The morning of the very next school day, Monday, Sept. 15, Academy administrators met with these students to understand their experiences and to support them in finding a meaningful way to honor Charlie. As a result of this meeting, the students were given approval and planned to wear red ties on another day. But, instead they chose to collaborate with the Academy's team to plan a future chapel focused on being bold and impactful in their faith."</p><p>The Tennessean reported that the academy issued an apology for how it handled the incident.</p><p>After parents expressed outrage at Savage for enforcing the dress code policy, many felt the situation worsened when the school promoted the administrator to another position.</p><p>The Churches of Christ-affiliated school announced Sept. 25 that Savage would transition from head of school to director of academics for the upper school. A spokesperson told The Tennessean that Savage’s move into the new role was already in progress before the dress code controversy.</p><p>"The role of Director of Academics has been in development for over a year, with Dr. Savage expressing interest. Given his expertise, he is well-suited for this senior leadership position," the academy said in a statement to The Tennessean.</p><p>Lipscomb Academy’s statement did not satisfy parents and other stakeholders, leading to more than two dozen protesters who gathered on Sept. 26 at the school’s front lawn during morning drop-off.</p><p>"During morning drop-off Sept 26, demonstrators stood behind police barricades. Across the street was another group on the steps of the school who ushered students in, which included current staff at the academy and other community members," The Tennessean reported.</p><p>Several counterprotesters also gathered in support of Savage, some holding signs reading "Alumni for Savage."</p><p>TV personality Savannah Chrisley praised the students in a social media post. </p><p>"So proud of the brave young men at Lipscomb Academy in Nashville who tried to honor Charlie Kirk’s life only to be silenced, reprimanded, and failed by the very school that should be shaping leaders of courage and conviction," she wrote.

<div class="article-title">Bondi directs FBI, DEA, others to guard ICE facilities</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Attorney General Pam Bondi signed a memo on Monday directing agents from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and other Justice Department agencies to assist in guarding Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.</p><p>The move by Bondi — which she hinted at on Friday — came after one detainee was killed and two others were injured in a <span class="link">shooting</span> at an ICE field office in Dallas on Wednesday, the latest shooting or threat targeting an <span class="link">ICE facility</span> or immigration agent in recent months. She cast that attack as the latest act of "extreme political violence."</p><p>In a memo shared on X, Bondi said the FBI, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives should "immediately direct all necessary officers and agents to defend ICE facilities and personnel whenever and wherever they come under attack." She also announced the formation of a temporary "ICE Protection Task Force" that could include federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.</p><p>She singled out Portland and Chicago for operations to protect ICE facilities, and said she's directing federal prosecutors in both cities to seek charges against anybody accused of threatening or assaulting law enforcement. President Trump is also <span class="link">looking to deploy</span> <span class="link">hundreds of troops</span> to the two cities, drawing vehement opposition from local officials.</p><p>ICE has said attacks on its agents have spiked this year, as the Trump administration uses the agency to dramatically increase arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants. In recent months, ICE operations in <span class="link">Los Angeles</span>, <span class="link">Chicago</span>, <span class="link">New York</span> and elsewhere have drawn tense protests and clashes between agents and demonstrators.</p>
<p>On Friday, Bondi also floated a broader crackdown on "repeated acts of violence and obstruction against federal agents." She directed the Joint Terrorism Task Forces — which are regional entities scattered throughout the country that work with the FBI and with state and local police — to look into what she described as "domestic terrorism."</p><p>"The Department of Justice will seek the most serious available charges against all participants in these criminal mobs, including conspiracy offenses, assault offenses, civil disorder offenses, and terrorism offenses," the attorney general wrote Friday.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Trump signed a memo calling for investigations into "political violence and intimidation," led by the Joint Terrorism Task Forces. The White House pointed to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk earlier this month, last year's assassination attempts against Mr. Trump, and an increase in attacks on ICE officers.</p><p>The president also <span class="link">penned an executive order</span> labeling antifa a domestic terrorist organization. The move's legal implications aren't clear. Antifa, short for "anti-fascist," generally refers to a loose collection of largely left-wing activists, not a cohesive organization with a leadership structure.

<div class="article-title">Here's how Trump's proposed Gaza peace plan would work</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump offered up a 20-point plan Monday that he cast as a roadmap to end the Israel-Hamas war, a proposal that was backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — though it remains unclear how Hamas will respond.</p><p>The plan — which was <span class="link">presented as Netanyahu visited the White House</span> — calls for Hamas to return all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and for Israel's military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases. It proposes handing over parts of Gaza to a "technocratic" committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.</p><p>Mr. Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu that his goal is to ensure a "sustainable, long-term peace." </p><p>Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.</p><p>Netanyahu said Monday he supports the plan, which "achieves our war aims." He said if Hamas does not accept the offer, "Israel will finish the job by itself."</p>
<p>Hamas has not yet responded to the proposal. Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief met with negotiators from Hamas, who said they would review the proposal "in good faith" and provide a response, a White House official told CBS News.</p><p>Some unanswered questions about the plan still linger, including the exact timing of possible Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and the involvement of different international partners.</p><h2>Israel and Hamas would stop fighting, trade hostages and prisoners</h2><p>The plan calls for an immediate end to fighting if both Israel and Hamas agree to the plan, with Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip immediately withdrawing to an "agreed upon line."</p><p>"During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal," the plan states.</p>
<p>Within 72 hours of Israel accepting the deal, which Netanyahu appeared to do Monday, Hamas is expected to free all remaining hostages. Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.</p><p>In exchange, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, as well as 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the current conflict. The plan calls for the remains of 15 deceased Gazans to be returned for every one deceased hostage. The Israeli releases would take place after the hostages are released by Hamas.</p><p>The plan calls for Gaza to be demilitarized "under the supervision of independent monitors," with any weapons factories and tunnels destroyed and weapons decommissioned.</p><p>"A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people," one of the 20 points states.</p><h2>Aid and economic development would enter Gaza</h2><p>The plan states "full aid will be immediately sent" to Gaza, which has faced <span class="link">severe food shortages</span> and has fallen into famine in some regions, according to the world's leading authority on food crises. </p><p>It calls for aid deliveries that are at least equal to the levels agreed upon during a <span class="link">prior two-month ceasefire</span> that began in January, with supplies flowing through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza. It also states the plan would involve "rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries."</p><p>It states aid would be distributed by "international institutions not associated in any manner with either party," including the United Nations and the Red Crescent. The plan does not mention the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a <span class="link">controversial</span> U.S.- and Israeli-backed group that has handled many aid deliveries in the territory in recent months, whose members have been repeatedly accused of firing at Palestinians trying to get aid.</p>
<p>The proposal also floats convening a "panel of experts" that could draw up economic redevelopment plans for the Gaza Strip. It states Gaza would exist in a "special economic zone" with "preferred tariff and access rates."</p><h2>Gaza to be led by "technocratic" group and stabilization force, not Hamas</h2><p>After Israel withdraws from parts of Gaza, the plan calls for the territory to be governed by neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority, which currently oversees much of the West Bank.</p><p>Instead, the enclave would be governed by a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza." It's not clear who would participate in that committee, but the plan states it would be composed of "qualified Palestinians and international experts."</p><p>Overseeing this new governing structure would be a "Board of Peace" chaired by Mr. Trump.</p><p>In a press conference Monday, the president said he's slated to lead the board "not at my request, believe me. I'm very busy. But we have to make sure this works."</p><p>The plan also envisions an "International Stabilization Force" that would temporarily oversee security in Gaza. This group would be backed by the U.S. and Arab states, and tasked with training "vetted Palestinian Police forces" in collaboration with Jordan and Egypt. </p><p>It states Hamas would need to "agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form." But Hamas members would get amnesty if they "commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons," and members of the group who want to leave the territory would be able to do so.</p>
<p>The plan would also — at least temporarily — sideline the Palestinian Authority, which has played a key part in security and governance in the occupied Palestinian territories since the 1990s. The authority is dominated by Fatah, a political movement that has long been at odds with Hamas, and it has not governed Gaza since Hamas took over the strip in 2007.</p><p>Netanyahu has long criticized the Palestinian Authority. He said Monday the group would have "no role whatsoever in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation," including changes to its education system and an end to a long-controversial stipend system for the families of Palestinian militants.</p><p>The West Bank — which Israel has occupied since 1967 — is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. The Gaza Strip was also occupied in 1967, though Israel withdrew from the territory and removed its settlements in 2005. The territory has been under a tight Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas' 2007 takeover.</p><h2>Israel would withdraw from Gaza and won't annex territory</h2><p>The Israel Defense Forces would immediately withdraw from part of Gaza after a deal is reached. It would continue to withdraw from parts of the territory and hand over control to the new International Stabilization Force "based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization."</p><p>Israeli forces would remain present in a "security perimeter," however, until Gaza "is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat," the plan states. Netanyahu said Monday the IDF would remain in that perimeter "for the foreseeable future."</p><p>If Hamas doesn't accept the proposal, it calls for the plan to "proceed in the terror-free areas" that are handed over from the Israeli military to the new stabilization force.</p><h2>Plan calls statehood an "aspiration of the Palestinian people"</h2><p>The proposal does not lay out a clear roadmap for an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But it says that, if the plan works out, "the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people."</p>
<p>Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, and has castigated U.S. allies like the United Kingdom and France for recognizing a Palestinian state last week at the United Nations General Assembly, calling it an "absurd prize for terrorism." Mr. Trump has also opposed calls for a Palestinian state. But key Arab partners have backed Palestinian statehood and cast it as a necessary component of any long-term resolution.</p><p>The plan also pushes for an "interfaith dialogue process" to "try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis," and a "dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence."</p>

<div class="article-title">Investigation continues into fatal Michigan church shooting, fire</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Everyone is now accounted for in the aftermath of a shooting and fire at a Michigan church during Sunday services, authorities said during a press conference Monday. The FBI is investigating the Grand Blanc Township melee as "an act of targeted violence." </p><p>About 100 people were inside the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on McClandlish Road around 10:25 a.m. Sunday <span class="link">when the shooting happened</span>.</p><p>The suspect, identified as a 40-year-old <span class="link">Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan</span>, drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church, exited his vehicle and fired "several rounds" of an assault rifle at hundreds of churchgoers, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said.</p><p>"This was an evil act of violence. That's exactly what this was," Renye said.  </p><p>Four victims were killed in the shootings. The shooter is also dead, officials said. Two victims remain in critical condition at an area hospital, and six others were reported to be in stable condition, according to hospital officials. Henry Ford Genesys Hospital said it provided care for some of the victims.</p>
<p>The victims range in age from 6 to 78 years old. Henry Ford officials say that of the eight victims, five were treated for gunshot wounds and three were treated for smoke inhalation.</p><p>Monday's press conference was the final in a series of in-person reports, with local police saying additional updates will come from their social media. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was among those who spoke Monday, alongside FBI Detroit acting special agent in charge Reuben C. Coleman, Genesee County Sheriff Christopher R. Swanson, ATF special agent in charge of the Detroit Field Office James Deir and Michigan State Police Director Col. James F. Grady II. </p><p>Deir asked that area residents avoid the area near the church, which has been blocked off, asking for cooperation from the public as investigators continue to comb through the wreckage left by the fire. Over 100 victims and witnesses have been interviewed so far, Coleman said. Numerous special teams from state and federal agencies are working on the case, including a National Response Team from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p><p>In the meantime, the authorities praised the dedication of first responders and law enforcement at the scene, some of whom had only two months experience on the job, along with the immediate response of the church attendees during the incident. </p>
<p>"There are noble heroes who do not wear a uniform that went to that church yesterday .... Those heroes from that church did their job," the sheriff said.</p><p><span class="link">Survivor Paul Kirby told "CBS Mornings"</span> it was "the scariest moment of my life, not knowing if my family was OK." Kirby's wife and children were with him, attending a service at the church, when they heard "a loud boom coming from the back wall of the chapel."</p><p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said investigators were looking into how much planning went into the attack and whether any clues about the motive were left behind.</p><p>"From what I understand, based on my conversations with the FBI director, all they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith," she said Monday. </p><p>The shooting occurred a day after Russell M. Nelson, the oldest-ever president of the Utah-based faith, died at 101.</p><p>Sanford was an Iraq war veteran who deployed once for several months during 2007 and 2008, according to service records provided to CBS News by the Pentagon. Sanford served in the Marines for four years. </p><p>Crews in white coveralls and hard hats searched through what remained of the church on Monday morning. A silver pickup truck with two American flags in the back remained where it had smashed into the front brick wall near a sign that says "visitors welcome."</p>
<p>U.S. officials and state lawmakers <span class="link">shared messages</span> in response to the shooting, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered U.S. and Michigan flags to be lowered to half-staff through Friday to honor and remember the victims. </p><p>Grand Blanc Community Schools were closed on Monday. </p><p>Bloomfield Township Police says it will "increase patrols around our places of worship and other community gatherings to help ensure a safe environment for everyone." </p><p>The shooting was the latest of several attacks on houses of worship in the U.S. over the past 20 years, including one in August that killed two children at the Church of the Annunciation in Minneapolis.</p><p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is leading the investigation, has asked anyone with information to call 1-800-225-5324 or submit a tip here. </p>

<div class="article-title">Hurricane Humberto could bring dangerous surf to East Coast</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Hurricane Humberto is likely to bring dangerous surf to most of the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda this week, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said, adding that tropical storm conditions are possible in Bermuda on Tuesday.</p><p>The swells will likely cause "life-threatening surf and rip current conditions," the center warned.</p><p>Humberto rapidly strengthened over the weekend, reaching <span class="link">Category 5</span> strength on Saturday before fluctuating back down to a still-powerful Category 4 on Sunday. It had weakened to a Category 3 storm — still considered a major hurricane — by Monday night.</p><p>The storm is <span class="link">one of two systems</span> swirling over the western Atlantic. The other one strengthened into <span class="link">Tropical Storm Imelda</span> on Sunday and is forecast to become a hurricane, but move away from the southeastern U.S.</p><h2>Hurricane Humberto forecast and path</h2><p>Humberto's center on Monday was about 265 miles southwest of Bermuda. It was moving north-northwest at about 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph, making it a major Category 3 hurricane, according to the hurricane center.</p>
<p>The center of Humberto is forecast to pass west and then north of Bermuda on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Fluctuations in intensity are possible today [Monday]. Gradual weakening is forecast after that, but Humberto is expected to remain a dangerous major hurricane into Tuesday," the hurricane center said.</p><p>"Swells generated by Humberto will continue to affect portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Bermuda through much of this week," forecasters at the hurricane center warned.</p><p>People along the U.S. East Coast are expected to see the effects of Humberto for the next several days, with the potential for life-threatening surf and rip currents.</p>
<p>Humberto is the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. It came on the heels of <span class="link">Hurricane Gabrielle</span>, which wasn't impacting land as it headed farther out into the Atlantic.</p><h2>Forecasters also tracking Imelda</h2><p>The hurricane center is also closely monitoring a second storm system over the northeast Caribbean in the Atlantic, which strengthened into <span class="link">Tropical Storm Imelda</span> on Sunday and is expected to become a hurricane Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>A hurricane watch is in effect for Bermuda, meaning hurricane conditions are possible, due to the forecasted path of Imelda, the NHC said.  </p><p>Imelda was expected to bring "significant rainfall" to portions of Cuba and the Bahamas through Thursday, the hurricane center said. It will also likely produce flash and urban flooding, with the possibility of mudslides in higher terrain across eastern Cuba.</p>
<p>There was also a possibility it <span class="link">could interact with Humberto</span> — a phenomenon known as <span class="link">the Fujiwhara effect</span>, in which two different storms converge and either join or spin around each other. But CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said such an outcome is not considered likely in this case.</p>

<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Tropical Storm Imelda is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane on Tuesday morning, but maps show it moving away from the southeastern U.S., according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center.</p><p>Imelda is the ninth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed on Sunday in the western Atlantic.</p><h2>Tropical Storm Imelda forecast maps</h2><p>As of 11 p.m. ET Monday, Imelda was moving away from the Bahamas, according to the hurricane center's latest advisory. The storm's center was about 140 miles north of Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas and 205 miles east of Cape Canaveral, Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. It was moving north at 8 mph, the hurricane center said.</p>
<p>"A turn toward the northeast is expected later tonight [Monday] followed by a turn toward the east-northeast at a faster forward speed on Tuesday," the NHC said in its latest update, adding that the center of the system "should move away from the northwestern Bahamas" Monday night and "away from the southeastern United States on Tuesday," but would approach Bermuda on Wednesday.</p><p>Rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with up to 4 inches are expected through Tuesday across northeast Florida, coastal South Carolina and coastal sections of southeast North Carolina.</p><p>Swells generated by Tropical Storm Imelda and Hurricane <span class="link">Humberto</span> are affecting the Bahamas and will spread to much of the U.S. East Coast early this week, the center added, warning that they're "likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions."</p>
<h2>Tropical storm warnings and watches for Imelda</h2><p>A hurricane watch was issued for Bermuda, the hurricane center said. A tropical storm warning that had been issued for the northwestern Bahamas was canceled Monday night.</p>
<p>A tropical storm watch that had been issued for part of Florida's east coast, from the Palm Beach-Martin County line to the Flagler-Volusia County line, was canceled Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Imelda was expected to drop between 4 and 8 inches of rain across the northwest Bahamas through Tuesday, and 2 to 4 inches across eastern Cuba. State media in Cuba reported that a 60-year-old man died in Santiago de Cuba following landslides there.</p><h2>Imelda follows Hurricane Humberto</h2><p>Imelda came on the heels of <span class="link">Hurricane Humberto</span>, which rapidly intensified to a major hurricane over the Atlantic on Saturday but is not expected to reach land. Humberto reached as high as a Category 5 on Saturday before fluctuating back down to Category 4.</p>
<p>Forecasters said last week there was a small possibility the two systems could interact, creating what is <span class="link">known as a Fujiwhara effect</span>, a rare phenomenon in which two different storms merge and become entangled around a newly formed, common center. However, they said it wasn't considered a likely outcome in this case.</p>

<section class="content__body">
<p>A Mexican marine biologist was seriously injured after he was attacked by a shark while working off Costa Rica's Pacific coast and transferred to a hospital in the country's capital on Monday, authorities said. </p><p>Costa Rica's Fire Department said it had rescued 48-year-old Mauricio Hoyos from the attack Saturday and carried him on a 36-hour journey from Cocos Island, around 340 miles off the coast. Despite the serious injuries to his head, face and arms, Hoyos arrived at the hospital in stable condition.</p><p>"He was tagging species for monitoring and when he tagged one of the island's shark species, the shark turned," said Luis Fernández, a physician with the fire department. "It was about 4 meters long with an enormous bite force — it turned and bit him on the head."</p><p>Hoyos was leading a scientific expedition as part of the One Ocean Worldwide Coalition, a collaborative initiative that includes the organizations Fins Attached, For the Oceans Foundation, Reserva Tortuga and the Rob Stewart Sharkwater Foundation.</p><p>"Incidents like this are extremely rare," Alex Antoniou, executive director of Fins Attached, said on social media. "Dr. Hoyos is an extraordinary scientist who has dedicated his career to shark conservation, and we are deeply grateful for the support of the Cocos Island community in this very difficult time."</p>
<p>Cocos Island is a Costa Rican national park and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. It is renowned for its great diversity of species, particularly sharks.</p><p>In 2017, an <span class="link">American woman was killed</span> after being mauled by a female tiger shark near the island. Her dive guide was also seriously injured in the attack. Authorities at the time said it was the first attack of its kind near the national park.</p><p>According to Costa Rica's Ministry of Environment and Energy, there are about 14 species of sharks — including whale sharks, hammerhead sharks and tiger sharks — inhabiting the area, making it a popular spot for divers.</p>

<div class="article-title">Judge suspends Trump's plan to cut jobs at Voice of America's parent agency</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A federal judge agreed Monday to temporarily suspend the Trump administration's plan to <span class="link">eliminate hundreds of jobs</span> at the agency that oversees <span class="link">Voice of America</span>, the government-funded broadcaster founded to counter Nazi propaganda during World War II.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., ruled that the U.S. Agency for Global Media cannot implement a reduction in force eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees on Tuesday. Those employees represent the vast majority of its remaining staff.</p><p>Kari Lake, the agency's acting CEO, announced in late August that the job cuts would take effect Tuesday. But the judge's ruling preserves the status quo at the agency until he rules on a plaintiffs' underlying motion to block the reduction in force.</p><p>Lamberth previously ruled that President Trump's administration <span class="link">must restore VOA programming</span> to levels commensurate with its statutory mandate to "serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news." He also blocked Lake from removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA's director.</p><p>The judge had also ruled separately that the Trump administration had failed to show how it was complying with his orders to restore VOA's operations.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump signed an executive order in March effectively shutting down the taxpayer-funded broadcaster for what the White House has called "radical propaganda." CBS News reached out to the White House on Monday for comment.</p><h2>Judge cites "concerning disrespect" toward the court</h2><p>Lamberth accused the administration of showing "concerning disrespect" toward the court in response to his earlier orders to produce information about its plans for Voice of America.</p><p>Employees who sued to block the dismantling of VOA claimed the planned cuts would hamper the judge's ability to enforce the injunction he issued in April. "This Court should therefore preserve the status quo while the parties litigate compliance," their attorneys wrote.</p><p>Government lawyers accused the plaintiffs of impermissibly trying to micromanage the agency's operations. "Enjoining the reductions in force would be a wholly overbroad and improper remedy," they wrote.</p>
<p>Lamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1987.</p><h2>Can media agency continue to fulfill its "statutory mission?"</h2><p>The U.S. Agency for Global Media also houses Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba. The networks, which together reach an estimated 427 million people, date to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend U.S. influence and combat authoritarianism.</p><p>The broadcasters have for decades served to project American values around the world while sharing fact-based news in a variety of languages. With Voice of America falling silent, Republican Rep. Young Kim of California told <span class="link">"60 Minutes"</span> earlier this year that she worries the U.S. is <span class="link">ceding the airwaves</span> to foreign dictators.</p><p>"When we are in an information war and we stop broadcasting into those repressive governments and into repressive societies … they are not going to hear the truth," she said at the time.</p><p>Congress appropriated $875 million to the agency for fiscal year 2025 and required that $260 million of the funds must be spent by VOA.</p><p>In March, Trump signed an executive order calling for the agency to reduce its "statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law." A day later, VOA stopped broadcasting for the first time in 83 years. The agency placed almost all of its full-time employees on administrative leave.</p><p>In announcing the job cuts on social media last month, Lake said the agency "will continue to fulfill its statutory mission ... and will likely improve its ability to function."</p>
<p>"I look forward to taking additional steps in the coming months to improve the functioning of a very broken agency and make sure America's voice is heard abroad where it matters most," she wrote.</p><p>Plaintiffs' attorney Georgina Yeomans argued Monday that the cuts would cement the agency's programming at deficient levels that don't comply with the judge's orders. Yeomans said it's unclear who at the agency is making key decisions, such as which jobs to eliminate.</p><p>"We simply do not know," she said.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>In its push to hold captured territory in <span class="link">Ukraine</span>, Russia has turned to countries like <span class="link">North Korea</span> for added manpower. Now, it appears <span class="link">additional support</span> is also coming from Cuban mercenaries.</p><p>Videos obtained by CBS News appear to show Cuban nationals captured by Ukraine on the front lines with Russia. Ukrainian officials estimate as many as 20,000 Cubans have been recruited by Russia to fight as mercenaries.</p><p>"Cubans are looking for any way to get out," Florida GOP Rep. Mario Diaz Balart said. "They're recruiting Cubans from around the island with these false promises."</p><p>Ukrainian officials, who shared copies of dozens of passports belonging to Cubans they believe to be mercenaries, say Cubans are being offered one-year contracts with the promise of a $2,000 monthly salary. The average monthly salary in Cuba is about 6,500 Cuban pesos, according to government data, which is equivalent to less than $20. The average age of the mercenaries is 35. Many of those recruited live in poverty and are in desperate need of money.</p><p>One family of a Cuban national who went to fight in Russia told CBS News their loved one has been missing since November, and they haven't received any money.</p>
<p>Orlando Gutierrez Boronat, a Cuban-American activist and a member of the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, a human rights organization dedicated to a free Cuba, traveled to Ukraine last year and spoke to one of the Cuban nationals. Boronat said the prisoner he spoke to was told he would do construction, helping rebuild cities destroyed in the war.</p><p>"When he got to Russia, he found out he and dozens of other Cubans were being assigned roles in the front lines," Boronat said.</p><p>Officials in Ukraine have compiled a list of 39 Cubans who have been killed, but they believe the death toll to be much higher.</p><p>"Currently, we have three Cuban prisoners of war. Two of them have been captured in the last two months," Maryan Zablotskyy, a member of Ukraine's parliament, said.</p>
<p>"We think that, eventually, the number of Cuban troops will hit at least 25,000, becoming the No. 1 contingent of foreign troops in Russia," Zablotskyy said, which would overtake North Korea.<strong> </strong></p><p>Diaz Balart said this "absolutely does not happen without the coordination and the approval and the support of the Cuban regime."</p><p>The Cuban government denied any involvement and said it has cracked down on trafficking rings recruiting Cuban nationals. </p>

<p>In Dr. Gladys Maestre, South Texas has found a national authority on memory loss. For years, Maestre has studied dementia by going door to door.</p><p>"Everywhere I go, people will pull me and say, 'My mother, my sister, I have a memory problem,'" Maestre said.</p><p>The results of her study, which was conducted through the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley's Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center for Minority Aging Research, astounded her. She found that close to 20% of people over 65 in the Rio Grande Valley have memory loss, versus around 12% on a national level. But she suspects the number is actually much higher — potentially up to 40% of the community.</p><p>Maestre is looking at genetic factors, health issues such as diabetes and pollution, and generational issues, including trauma and poverty.  </p><p>The reason why it's happening is unclear, but the impact is unmistakable. </p>
<p>For David and Dawna Johonnett, childhood sweethearts, it was love at first sight. But at 71, Dawna's worsening dementia brought them to Maestre's clinic, where she couldn't recall the shape of a circle.</p><p>When asked if she notices the changes happening, Dawna said, "Yes, I'm me, but I don't know how to say it, but it's not me anymore."</p><p>Texas alone has nearly half a million people with Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, according to the Alzheimer's Association and the Texas Department of State Health Services. State lawmakers this year overwhelmingly approved a $3 billion bill to fund dementia research over the next decade. Voters still have to approve it this fall, and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick hopes they do.</p><p>"I've never had a bigger response than this bill," Patrick said, adding, "It's only getting worse."</p>
<p>Maestre's cutting-edge research includes blood testing for biomarkers. They can identify who's at risk and put those patients on a prevention program.</p><p>For now, David and Dawna Johonnett feel as though they've waded into a darkening drama.</p><p>"How can we make the quality of life that we have now last?"

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who was initially <span class="link">relieved of his duties</span> after being <span class="link">captured on video</span> pushing a woman to the ground outside an immigration court in New York City has been returned to duty, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter told CBS News.</p><p>The officials, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal move that has not been publicly announced, said the ICE officer was placed back on duty after a preliminary review of the incident.</p><p>The move is a striking about-face, just a few days after the Department of Homeland Security released a statement denouncing the officer's conduct as "unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE."  </p><p>"Our ICE law enforcement are held to the highest professional standards and this officer is being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation," the department said in its statement on Friday. It's unclear where that investigation stands.</p><p>The ICE officer's actions garnered national attention last week, after videos surfaced on social media depicting his confrontation with a visibly upset Ecuadoran woman at the 26 Federal Plaza building, which houses Manhattan's immigration court.</p>
<p>The confrontation appeared to have started when the woman and her daughter tried to cling to her husband, whom federal immigration officers were attempting to take into custody. Officials were captured on video trying to separate the family, and one of the officers was seen grabbing the woman's hair. Footage shows the husband was ultimately detained by federal agents.</p><p>Another video depicts the woman confronting the ICE officer who was initially relieved of his duties. Visibly distraught, she confronts him. "Take me, too," she is heard saying in Spanish. Video appears to show the woman touching the officer with her hands. He tells her not to touch him.</p><p>The officer is then captured on camera pushing the woman to the floor in front of her children and a crowd of journalists and federal and court officials. The ICE officer is heard saying "adios" — or goodbye — several times during the altercation.</p><p>In a statement shared Monday, ICE identified the woman's husband as Ruben Abelardo Ortiz-Lopez, saying he illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in March 2024. The agency said he came onto ICE's radar after being arrested in June by local authorities for "assault and criminal obstruction of breathing or blood circulation."</p>
<p>ICE said the woman is also in the U.S. unlawfully and faces deportation proceedings.</p><p>Reached for comment, a DHS official did not address the officer being placed back on duty but called the woman's husband a "criminal illegal alien."</p><p>"President Trump and Secretary Noem are not going to allow criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens," the official said. "If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will arrest you and you will never return."</p><p>CBS News reached out to representatives for ICE and the White House for comment.</p><p>Soon after the videos of the altercation emerged, New York Rep. Dan Goldman and New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, both Democrats, urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate the ICE officer and explore "potential prosecution." Goldman accused the ICE officer of "violently" assaulting the woman from Ecuador.</p><p>"Not only should this individual no longer work for the United States government, but the Department of Justice should aggressively enforce the criminal laws against him, consistent with the precedents set by this administration," Goldman said in a statement.</p>

<div class="article-title">YouTube to pay $22 million for White House ballroom to settle lawsuit from Trump</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by President Trump, who sued the video-sharing platform and its chief executive for temporarily suspending Mr. Trump's account after the 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, court papers filed Monday show.</p><p>The bulk of the money is slated to go to a <span class="link">planned White House ballroom</span> backed by Mr. Trump.</p><p>The settlement, filed in the U.S. District Court in Northern California, ends a four-year legal battle between the company and Mr. Trump, who has also recently settled with <span class="link">Meta</span> and <span class="link">X</span> after suing the Big Tech firms for similar suspensions. Mr. Trump's accounts on Meta and X were restored in 2022, and his YouTube account was restored in 2023. </p><p>In January, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, agreed to <span class="link">pay $25 million</span> to Mr. Trump to settle a 2021 lawsuit <span class="link">over its own suspension</span> of his accounts following the Capitol attack. A month later, X <span class="link">agreed</span> to pay Mr. Trump $10 million to settle its lawsuit, which was filed before billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk bought the platform. </p><p>The lawsuit against YouTube argued that the suspension violated Mr. Trump's First Amendment rights because it was allegedly done "in response to coercion of the federal government." Attorneys for the tech firm had called that argument "meritless" in a 2021 court filing, and said forcing the platform to host Mr. Trump without any restrictions "would conflict with YouTube's own First Amendment rights."</p>
<p>In settling the lawsuit, YouTube and its parent company, Google parent Alphabet, agreed to pay $22 million to Mr. Trump, all of which will be directed into the Trust for the National Mall, a fund that is "dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating that National Mall" and "to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom" that Mr. Trump is building.</p><p>Some $2.5 million will go to the other plaintiffs in the case whose accounts were removed from the site, including the American Conservative Union.  </p><p>Trump attorney John Coale told CBS News, "Glad it's over," noting that the settlements in Mr. Trump's cases against tech companies have added up to around $60 million.</p><p>A representative for Alphabet did not comment on the settlement.</p>
<p>The Trump administration <span class="link">announced</span> in July that a <span class="link">90,000-square-foot ballroom</span> with a seated capacity for 650 people will be constructed in the White House's East Wing. </p><p>CBS News <span class="link">reported</span> earlier this month that corporate and individual donors have pledged nearly $200 million to cover construction costs, and fundraising is ongoing. Google, R.J. Reynolds, Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin, Palantir and NextEra Energy have donated, sources told CBS News, and so have firms in the tech, manufacturing, banking and health industries.</p><p>Mr. Trump has cultivated closer ties with tech companies since returning to office. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos attended his inauguration in January, and Musk led his administration's Department of Government Efficiency for months.</p>

<div class="article-title">ChatGPT introduces new parental controls amid concerns over teen safety</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT, announced new parental controls on Monday aimed at helping protect young people who interact with its generative artificial intelligence program.  </p><p>All ChatGPT users will have access to the control features from Monday onward, the company said.</p><p>The announcement comes as OpenAI, which technically allows users as young as 13 to sign up, contends with mounting public pressure to prioritize <span class="link">the safety of ChatGPT</span> for teenagers. (OpenAI says on its website that it requires users ages 13 to 18 to obtain parental consent before using ChatGPT.)</p><p>In August, the California-based technology company pledged to implement changes to its flagship product after facing <span class="link">a wrongful death lawsuit</span> by parents of a 16-year-old who alleged the chatbot led their son to take his own life. </p><p>OpenAI's new controls will allow parents to link their own ChatGPT accounts to the accounts of their teenagers "and customize settings for a safe, age-appropriate experience," OpenAI said in Monday's announcement. Certain types of content are then automatically restricted on a teenager's linked account, including graphic content, viral challenges, "sexual, romantic or violent" role-play, and "extreme beauty ideals," according to the company.</p>
<p>Along with content moderation, parents can opt to receive a notification from OpenAI should their child exhibit potential signs of harming themselves while interacting with ChatGPT.</p><p>"If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation," the company said. "If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out."</p><p>The company also said it is "working on the right process and circumstances in which to reach law enforcement or other emergency services" in emergencies where a teen may be in imminent danger and a parent cannot be reached.</p><p>"We know some teens turn to ChatGPT during hard moments, so we've built a new notification system to help parents know if something may be seriously wrong," OpenAI said.</p>
<p>OpenAI has introduced other measures recently aimed at helping safeguard younger ChatGPT users. The company said earlier this month that chatbot users identified as being under 18 will automatically be directed to a version that is governed by "age-appropriate" content rules. </p><p>"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult," the company said at the time. </p><p>It noted on Monday, however, that while guardrails help, "they're not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them."</p><p>People can use ChatGPT without creating an account, and parental controls and automatic content limits only work if users are signed in. </p><p>"We will continue to thoughtfully iterate and improve over time," the company said. "We recommend parents talk with their teens about healthy AI use and what that looks like for their family."</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission has started an inquiry into several social media and artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI, about the potential harms to teens and children who use their chatbots as companions. </p>

<div class="article-title">How would a government shutdown affect travel around the U.S.?</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Although a short U.S. <span class="link">government shutdown</span> would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups. </p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies would be expected to continue showing up on the job — without pay — even if lawmakers fail this week to strike a <span class="link">deal on federal funding</span>.</p><p>But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.</p><p>"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work," he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists. </p><p>Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the <span class="link">34-day government shutdown</span> that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.</p>
<p>"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer," Harmon-Marshall said.  </p><p>Barring a deal in Congress, a shutdown would begin at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.  </p><h2>$1 billion hit</h2><p>The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.</p><p>"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations," the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. "It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored."</p>
<p>The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year. </p><p>Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.</p><p>By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group said in a statement last week.</p><p>Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown. </p>

<section class="content__body">
<p>Video game company Electronic Arts (EA), known as the maker of the "The Sims" and "Madden NFL," is being acquired in a $55 billion deal.</p><p>The California-based company said Monday it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by a consortium of companies that includes Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund PIF; private equity firm Silver Lake, and Miami-based investment firm Affinity Partners, which is led by President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.  </p><p>If finalized, the deal would be the most expensive acquisition of a public company to be taken private in history — surpassing $32 billion paid to Texas utility TXU in 2007 to go private. </p><p>"The transaction positions EA to accelerate innovation and growth to build the future of entertainment," the company said in a statement.</p><p>As part of the agreement, which is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2027, stockholders will receive $210 per share in cash. Andrew Wilson, who has served as EA's CEO since 2013, will continue to lead the company once the transaction is completed, EA said.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts, which is headquartered in Redwood City, California, oversees a suite of popular video games including "Battlefield," "Apex Legends," "EA SPORTS College Football" and "Need for Speed" among others. In fiscal year 2025, the company posted a net revenue of approximately $7.5 billion.</p><p>The company was founded by former Apple employee Trip Hawkins in 1982. If the transaction closes as anticipated, it will end EA's 36-year history as a publicly traded company.</p><p>The $55 billion acquisition would also be one of the biggest game industry deals to date. The largest was three years ago, when <span class="link">Microsoft bought</span> video game company Activision Blizzard for roughly $69 billion.</p>

<div class="article-title">YouTube agrees to pay Trump $24 million to settle lawsuit over Jan. 6 suspension</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>YouTube will pay $24.5 million to President Trump to resolve a 2021 lawsuit that claimed he was the victim of censorship when the site suspended his account following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump's supporters, according to federal court papers filed on Monday.</p>
<p>YouTube parent company Google will dedicate $22 million of the settlement toward the construction of a $200 million Mar-a-Lago-style ballroom in the White House, according to the settlement documents, which state that a nonprofit called the Trust for the National Mall is being tapped to finance the renovations.</p>
<p>It's the latest settlement reached by a tech company sued by Trump in the wake of the Capitol riots. In January, Meta paid the president $25 million over Facebook's and Instagram's decision to suspend Trump after Jan. 6. Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter, paid out $10 million over similar allegations.</p>
<p>Free speech experts have said the trio of suits brought by Trump did not raise credible legal claims, since First Amendment protections typically apply to government officials, not private companies, censoring speech. Yet the tech industry has lined up one by one to make public displays of their eight-digit deals to conclude the litigation.</p> <p>"This is straight influence-peddling," said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University and an expert on online speech. "This YouTube settlement is not a sign of any legal merit."</p> <p>The White House and Google did not return requests for comment.</p> <p>The payout comes days after YouTube said it was reinstating accounts that had been permanently banned for spreading COVID-19 and election-related falsehoods, the latest loosening of social media misinformation rules since Trump took office. Some of the accounts that were kicked off YouTube over such violations include those belonging to former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now runs the Department of Health and Human Services and right-wing podcaster Dan Bongino, who is now the deputy director of the FBI.</p>
<p>Ponying up tens of millions of dollars to settle Trump's lawsuits alleging censorship is a striking about-face for Silicon Valley, which for years defended the right to police its own social media platforms.</p> <p>Legal protections, including a federal law known as Section 230, provide tech platforms with wide latitude to make their own content moderation decisions without being held liable for those actions, however controversial.</p> <p>Law professor Goldman said but for "an attempt to curry favor with the president," there is "absolutely no reason to believe Trump would have gotten anywhere with these suits."</p> <p>According to the settlement filing, $2.5 million will also be given to other plaintiffs, including the American Conservative Union and author Naomi Wolf, who was suspended from multiple social media platforms for sharing unfounded theories about COVID vaccines.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">A year after Helene, a group of raft guides embarks on a river clean-up mission</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>ERWIN, Tenn. — When Amelia Taylor learned that whitewater outfitters near the Nolichucky River would remain closed this season, she had to figure out how to make up for the lost income.</p>
<p>So she went from being a professional whitewater river guide to being a "professional trash lady," Taylor says. "I'm very proud of it. It's an honest day's work."</p> <p>Taylor has been a whitewater river guide in the area for about sixteen years. She says picking up trash along the river is not terrible despite the occasional bump, scrape and bruise.</p> <p>"I'm kind of a dumpster diver, so this job is fun for me 'cause I get to find useful things sometimes," she says. "In some ways, I honestly like this job more. I like to say the trash is easier to deal with than people," Taylor chuckles.</p>
<p>It's been a year since the remnants of Hurricane Helene walloped eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina with devastating and deadly flooding, and forcing most rafting companies to cease operations.</p>
<p>Rivers popular for whitewater rafting reopened for the 2025 season, except for the Nolichucky.</p> <p>On the morning of September 27, 2024, the storm hovered over the Southern Appalachians after it had been raining continuously for several days.</p> <p>"You saw thousands of years of change in parts of the landscape happen in two hours," said geologist and Appalachian region expert, Philip Prince.</p>
<p>"The Nolichucky flooding was proportionally the greatest of rivers in the region. It got literally the maximum possible effect of the Helene system all funneled down into that one river gorge," he says. The debris flow landslides hurled chunks of railroad tracks, houses and hazardous material into the river.</p> <p>The U.S. Forest Service closed the access points to the river as the year-long reconstruction and restoration were underway.</p> <p>Meanwhile, outfitters had to figure out how to reinvent themselves and their businesses. They are helping to clean up debris along the river banks that big machinery was not able to pick up. Through state-funded relief grants, the outfitters are able to pay raft guides like Amelia Taylor and other out-of-work guides to go on clean-up missions.</p>
<p>They use the company's big 6-person rafts and pile the garbage so high that the rapids can't be seen in front of them. Car parts, toys, tires, household items and lots of sheet metal from the roofs of washed-out houses.</p> <p>Lilly Johnson and her husband own one of the rafting companies that's contracted to do the cleanup work. They bought the business in March of last year. Six months later, Helene hit. Then a baby girl arrived.</p>
<p>Johnson says while it's been an uncertain year, at least their building is still standing, and for now, they'll use their rafts and staff to clean up the river.</p> <p>"It gives us a chance to put our guides to work," she says. "They're still doing what they're trained to do, paddling down the river in a raft. We're cleaning up our watershed so that it's ready for us when we're ready to get back out there."</p> <p>And they're seeing signs of progress. Dozens of river guides are doing clean-up missions nearly every day and feel confident they'll be able to get back on the river next year.</p>
<p>Trey Moore is a local paddler who knows just about every corner of the Nolichucky gorge.</p> <p>He teamed up with a few outfitters to form a non-profit and work alongside local, state and federal agencies to help Unicoi County recover from its outdoor-tourism economic shortfall and river restoration.</p> <p>"And we were able to go and take care of the river that has always taken care of us," Moore says.</p> <p>James Melonas, a U.S. Forest Service supervisor, says he recognizes the importance of outdoor recreation in the Southern Appalachians and is confident that boat ramps and access points<em> </em>will reopen soon. "Our plan and priority is to have those available and working for the 2026 season, so next spring," he says.</p>
<p>Moore says they have their work cut out for them. </p> <p>Guides need to be retrained. It's a new river, with new rapids and new risks. Local paddlers have started to informally refer to the river as the <em>New</em>-lichucky. </p> <p>Moore says he is starting to see a path forward in the Nolichucky Gorge returning as the top outdoor tourism destination of the southeast. "And so this destruction and fundamental change of this insanely large geological event is an opportunity for a rebirth and an opportunity to reconnect with the river, with the community and to heal."</p>

<div class="article-title">Lesotho's Famo music: from shepherd songs to gang wars</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>MASERU, Lesotho — Puseletso Seema is musical royalty in the tiny African mountain kingdom of Lesotho, where she's known as "the Queen of Famo" -– a popular genre of pastoral accordion music beloved by the country's people, the Basotho.</p> <p>But for all her fame, she never got rich, and the 77-year-old grandmother's living conditions these days are far from regal.</p> <p>She resides in a small, run-down home along a dusty road in the rural areas outside the capital, where small boys ride donkeys under the shadows of the mountains, and shepherds wrapped in colorful, patterned blankets watch over flocks of sheep.</p>
<p>It's winter, with strikingly clear blue skies and snow on the distant mountain peaks. Seema doesn't have money for electricity and is not well, coughing a lot as she reminisces about becoming the first woman to break into a music industry that was once strictly the preserve of men.</p>
<p>"Famo music is a music that is like jazz in other countries, it's the genre most known in Lesotho," she explains. "It's a music that is emotionally connected, you can express your happiness, sadness, all your feelings."</p> <p>Journalist Motsamai Mokotjo, who has written on the topic, explains famo this way: "In essence it's engraved in folk law, you know, it's poetry fused with the accordion."</p> <p>"It speaks to the history of Basotho and everything that's going on in the country. It's more like what people in America would say is hip hop, it's a form of expression," he adds.</p> <h3 class="edTag"> <strong>Wayfarers' Hymns</strong></h3> <p>Lesotho is one of the world's poorest countries, and Seema grew up with very little. She had no schooling and was put to work by her family as a child looking after the livestock. Usually it was boys who worked as shepherds, but Seema's parents didn't have a son. Still, she held her own.</p>
<p>"When I was in the fields I would sometimes fight with some of the herdboys," she laughs. "And I started singing this music when I was a shepherd."</p> <p>Famo started as a rural music among Lesotho's shepherds, but migrated to the urban areas along with the Basotho who went to work in South Africa's mines in the 20th century.</p>
<p>"It was there where they were introduced to an accordion," says Mpho Malikeng, a Maseru musician and artist who is an expert on famo. "That is the primary instrument of famo music."</p> <p>Lesotho is entirely surrounded by South Africa, whose mineral wealth and vast gold deposits made it a center of mining for decades. After a long day down the shafts, mineworkers would gather at rowdy makeshift pubs called shebeens, and play famo.</p> <p>Seema, too, went to try and make her fortune in Johannesburg, sometimes dubbed "egoli" or the city of gold. Not as a miner, but a performer for the miners – just as when she was a herder, a woman entering a man's world.</p>
<p>"I'm the first woman to produce famo music," she says. "Because that music was known for men to sing it and for women to dance to it, flicking up their skirts, when they went to shebeens."</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Government Ban</strong></h3> <p>Famo has changed a lot since Seema's day. These days, it's become inextricably associated with gang violence.</p> <p>While there are no exact statistics on how many lives have been lost to famo-related violence, it is bad enough that last year the Lesotho government launched a crackdown, banning some groups entirely as well as prohibiting media from reporting on the gang wars.</p> <p>"There are disturbing issues of murders taking place these days. Our families, relatives and friends are killed by these Famo gangs," said diamond magnate Prime Minister Sam Matekane last year.</p>
<p>"As the government we have released a gazette that indicates that these groups or these people, wherever they are, they should be known as terrorists," he added.</p>
<p>The government launched the crackdown after a spate of famo revenge killings in 2024. In one, in April, five members of the same family were killed. In July, famo star Khopolo Kholue, was gunned down alongside a local journalist investigating the gang wars.</p> <p>Mpho Malikeng , a musician and cultural activist from Lesotho, says the violence all comes down to famo musicians trading barbed insults in their song lyrics – and the antipathy then turns to real violence.</p> <p>"It's like a rap battle, so you have to diss your fellow battler, by dissing them, you're making them come up with better verses, and they're also dissing you back," he says.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Like a Rap Beef</strong></h3> <p>He likens the situation to the East coast-West coast rivalry between hip hop groups in 1990s Los Angeles, that resulted in the murders of Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G.</p> <p>There is also friction over turf, he adds, explaining: "You cannot be in a certain area listening to so-and so …. It may even cost you your life."</p> <p>However he says he thinks the government has gone too far with the bans, especially as some politicians and members of the security forces are themselves alleged to be involved with Famo gangs.</p> <p>"It has even infiltrated into the political landscape of the country, the politicians use all this to try and garner support for electioneering," he says.</p> <p>Prime Minister Matekane has admitted some members of the police are involved with famo gangs, saying: "We have learned as the government that some members of the security agencies are on the front row in these famo gangs. I appeal to them to quit that thing and do what they are employed to do."</p>
<p>NPR phoned police minister Lebona Lephema for comment on the crackdown, but he declined to comment and hung up.</p> <p>Despite having a population of only 2.3 million, Lesotho has high murder rates and illegal firearms are rife. The gang violence has also spilled into neighboring South Africa.</p> <p>Famo music is still popular among illegal miners there, who risk their lives exploring disused mine shafts to eke out a living. Many of them are Basotho, and are known as "zama zamas," or "those who take a chance." Some of them are engaged in gang violence too.</p> <p>"Queen of Famo," Seema, doesn't want to comment on the gang wars that have become part of the music culture. But she will say: "I don't like music that is vulgar or insulting or insinuating any hate."<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Comic Cristela Alonzo grew up in fear of border patrol. ICE has 'brought it all back'</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>For the first seven years of her life, comic Cristela Alonzo lived with her family in an abandoned diner in a south Texas border town. Alonzo's mother, a Mexican immigrant, had left an abusive marriage and was supporting herself and her four kids by making $150 a week working in a Mexican restaurant.</p> <p>Living in the diner, the family's electricity came from an extension cord that Alonzo's mother stretched to the building from the house next door. In the winter, she used a space heater to cook and to warm up water for bathing. </p> <p>"[My mother] used to have a 10-gallon pickle tub from work that she would fill up with water," Alonzo says. "We would get a little cup and we would fill the cup with water and then pour it on our bodies. And that's how we showered in the winter."</p>
<p>Alonzo says being poor meant there was no time to relax. She served as her mother's translator and helped with the household's paperwork. Her mother didn't have a bank account, so paying bills meant going to the post office to purchase money orders.</p> <p>"I was helping my mom with budget, household things my entire life," she says. "When I was in high school, I wallpapered our house while other people were going to prom, going to school dances."</p> <p>Alonzo attended a theater program in high school, and then went on to study theater in college. But she had to put her own ambitions on hold and quit college twice, to care for her mother and to help her sister raise her children. Eventually, Alonzo broke through as a stand-up comedian by performing across the country on college campuses. </p> <p>Alonzo's comedy is very personal, often focusing on socioeconomic class, her childhood experience and the current political climate. In 2014, Alonzo created and starred in <em>Cristela, </em>a semi-autobiographical sitcom that ran for one season on ABC. Her three Netflix specials are <em>Lower Classy, Middle Classy</em> and now <em>Upper Classy.</em></p>
<p>Currently a resident of Los Angeles, she says the recent ICE raids in the city remind her of the fear she experienced living with her mother, who was undocumented until Alonzo was 10. </p> <p>"You were hoping that your mother wouldn't be taken away from you," Alonzo says. "Living in Los Angeles and seeing the ICE raids, it reminds me of me being a child trying to protect my mother. And I had forgotten the feelings until I saw what was happening now and it brought it all back."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Interview highlights</h3> <p><strong>On why her parents immigrated to the U.S.</strong></p>
<p>That's the thing that I think is one of the perspectives in immigration that we don't talk about enough, is immigrants come to this country mostly out of a need. It's in search of this opportunity that they don't have at home. But if my parents could have made it happen, if they could have had a decent life … they would have stayed in Mexico. But they decided ultimately the United States was a better opportunity for their children. ... In my experience, the immigrants that I grew up with and knew were so brave and they never understood that they were brave. They never gave themselves credit for doing everything that they did. </p> <p><strong>On her mom's decision to leave her abusive marriage</strong></p> <p>My mom grew up in a little village, a little ranchito in Mexico called El Zancarrón. Back then, it was, like, in the middle of nowhere. And my mom grew very Catholic. And her parents were very strict, her mother was very strict. And people couldn't date. You actually had a lot of arranged marriages a lot of times, where girls would be engaged to older men, because the men had all the power. ...</p> <p>My mom and my dad got married through the Church so they couldn't divorce. My mom left my dad, but they never divorced because they were Catholic. So she stayed married to him. But after they got married … he would drink a lot, be very physically abusive to her. He had another family. … She became the first woman in her family to leave her husband. ... This woman had, like, a second-grade education, couldn't speak the language here. And she decided that that was better than staying married to my dad.</p>
<p><strong>On the stress of growing up with an undocumented mother</strong></p> <p>She ended up getting her resident alien card. That's the highest she got. I was about 10 years old when she got her card. So for the first 10 years, it was a lot of us trying to protect her when we were in public. In the border town that I grew up in, in McAllen, Texas, it's a border town so you had border patrol agents out in public just kind of living amongst you because they were working near the border. So if we went out to eat and there was one of them there, my mom would have us either try to make some noise, pretend that we're throwing a tantrum so that she has to take us out of the building immediately to protect her. And we would have to play along, because we wanted to make sure that she was safe.</p>
<p><strong>On making the jump from theater to stand-up comedy </strong></p> <p>I wanted to do Broadway. And then a voice teacher when I was 18 years old told me that as a Latina, I could do <em>West Side Story</em> and <em>Chorus Line</em> and then I was kind of done. And it was weird because at that moment, I felt like somebody had said that my dream was limited and I had no chance to do it. And I ended up doing some kind of theater, but I couldn't get auditions. And I stopped doing theater. And then I decided to move to LA to try to be in TV and film. Then when I moved to LA, they were like, "Well, you have a crooked tooth and you're plus size. So I don't know how that's gonna work for you." … </p> <p>My mom ended up getting sick. My brother told me that she was on her deathbed and I had to come home, quit my job, went to Texas to see her. ...<strong> </strong>When my mom passed away, I was stuck in Dallas. We had moved to Dallas because we moved in with my sister, which is where the premise of my sitcom came. It came from that time of my life where I was taking care of mom and helping my sister raise her kids. My mom died. I was stuck and I needed a job. And I responded to this help wanted ad that needed office help and it was at the comedy club in Dallas, the Improv. And I became the office manager. And I started watching comics and I was like, you know what? This is kind of like theater. … And then I'm like, wait, I can write what I talk about? This is amazing. I'm gonna do stand-up. Stand-up is like theater. ... I was completely depressed. I was grieving my mom's loss and I went up on stage and started talking about my family and that's how it happened.</p>
<p><strong>On the culture shock of having money </strong></p> <p>Medical attention is such a luxury to so many people. I had to learn how to work with it, how to deal with it. I say it in the last special, like I didn't know what a checkup was. Like, why would you go to a doctor when you're not sick? Like, people just go? It was such a foreign concept. But yeah, I started having money where I could put my bills on auto pay. I could go to the doctor. I could buy a car. I bought a new car, like, 10 years ago. How? How was I able to do all of this stuff? I was always so grateful for the most basic things that I couldn't afford when I was a kid. I still go through that.</p> <p><strong>On being mentored by and working with labor activist Dolores Huerta </strong></p>
<p>I am a caregiver. My entire life has been caregiving. So for me, you tell me that I need to help someone and I am going to show up. It is my nature. It is in my DNA. It's my default. So the moment she and I became close, and I became friends with her kids, and I started just seeing her more, and during election years we would go and do voter registration, voter outreach. We would go to these house meetings out in the middle of the fields with, like, farm workers. I was so into trying to have that message that she has, which is coming into your power and using it. …</p> <p>I think that one of the biggest things for me is really actually putting a face to a community that is kind of invisible at times. I think that by being specific about my life and talking about it in stand-up, it allows others to know that a lot more people have things in common than they are different. I think the way that I was most helpful is to help give a narrative that doesn't sound preachy. I almost believe that I trick people into learning about my community.</p>

<div class="article-title">Compass-Anywhere real estate merger could squeeze small brokerages</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>A proposed $1.6 billion merger would unite the nation's two largest real estate behemoths, Compass and Anywhere, combining Compass's regional brokerages with Anywhere's nationally recognized brands, including Century 21 and Coldwell Banker. However, some industry observers caution that the consolidation may increase pressure on mom-and-pop brokerages.</p> <p>The deal, announced last week, is between Madison, N.J.-based Anywhere Real Estate and New York-based Compass, the largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage by sales volume. The combined brokerage company is expected to be worth $10 billion. It would create a combined 340,000-agent network at a time when the housing market is softening. The market has seen a decline in existing home sales, limited inventory, higher home prices and mortgage rates that remain stubbornly high following historic pandemic-era lows.</p>
<p>The merger is expected to go forward pending approval from shareholders and regulators.</p>
<p>Compass CEO and founder Robert Reffkin hailed the merger in a statement as a melding of resources that would preserve the independence of Anywhere's leading brands while creating "a place where real estate professionals can thrive for decades to come."</p> <p>"We have a unique opportunity to utilize the incredible breadth of talent across our companies, especially our world-class agents and franchisees, to deliver even more value to home buyers and home sellers across every phase of the home buying and home selling experience," Anywhere CEO &amp; President Ryan Schneider said in a statement about the deal.</p> <p>NPR reached out to Compass and Anywhere for comment, but did not receive a reply before publication.</p> <p>Tomasz Piskorski, a real estate professor at Columbia Business School, says it's too early to say for sure how the move will play out for consumers.</p> <p>"On one hand, bigger firms can wield monopoly power, limiting transparency and raising the risk of monopolistic practices," he says. "On the other, scale brings efficiencies — technology adoption, cost savings, and potentially lower fees — that can benefit consumers."</p> <p>The merger is expected to take place in the second half of 2026.</p>
<p>In recent years, the U.S. real estate brokerage industry has seen a reduction in the number of players, with larger firms gaining market share through mergers and acquisitions, significantly expanding the reach of the combined brokerages. In 2024, the three largest brokerages — Compass, Anywhere and eXp Realty — accounted for 17% of total sales volume, and the top 10% of brokerages represented 42%. The mergers have also helped drive a consolidation of Multiple Listing Services, or MLSs, which allow brokerages to share information on properties they have listed for sale.</p>
<p>In March, Rocket Companies, the parent of Rocket Mortgage — the online mortgage lender and refinancing portal —<strong> </strong>announced it was acquiring real estate listing company Redfin. Weeks later, it agreed to buy out Mr. Cooper, a mortgage industry competitor.</p> <p>Despite the trend toward fewer, larger, firms, Piskorski and others point out that the newly merged Compass/Anywhere combo would control less than a 20% share of the market, leaving several large and well-known competitors, such as eXp Realty, RE/MAX, investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices and Redfin.</p> <p>Peng (Peter) Liu, a professor of real estate and finance at Cornell University, says large brokerages offer wider reach for sellers, stronger customer databases, advanced technology and access to more potential buyers. He acknowledges concerns over market power, but believes they are overstated. "Both consumers and agents can switch firms readily, with households enjoying a wide range of options," including local brokerages, discount models and options such as iBuyers, which let homeowners skip agents and sell directly to tech-driven companies who then typically renovate and re-sell the property, according to Liu.</p> <p>However, real estate market analyst Jack McCabe, CEO of McCabe Research and Consulting, fears that the wave of consolidation in the industry is making it harder for independent firms to remain competitive. "Some will be pushed out of business; others will join the big firms because they really have no choice," he says.</p>
<p>McCabe acknowledges that it may not matter for the luxury end of the market, where buyers and sellers tend to go with agents with the strongest track record. At the lower-end of the market, however, "people often go with someone they know — a family member, a neighbor, a church friend."</p>
<p>He also notes the speed with which the industry is consolidating. "It's like the Great Recession, when 200 banks were swallowed up by five big investment banks. We're seeing the same thing now in real estate," he says. "Compass only started in 2012, and now — just 13 years later — they could become the largest brokerage in the world. That's remarkable."</p> <p>Piskorski says U.S. real estate commissions, typically around 5% to 6% of the sales price, are roughly double the global average — and that predates the current round of mergers. He expects that technological innovation brought by consolidation, as well as pressure from regulation and other market forces, will eventually reduce those fees.</p>
<p>In the end "customers value convenience and speed" maximized by the current trends, Piskorski says. "That's why Rocket Mortgage became the largest U.S. lender — even though it charged slightly higher rates — because people were willing to pay for a seamless digital experience."</p> <p>But that trend doesn't bode well for small, independent brokerages, he says. "The Holy Grail is digital closing: You click on a house, reserve it, see the appraisal and title instantly, get loan offers, and become a homeowner in days instead of weeks."<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Police say 'everyone has been accounted for' in Michigan church attack that killed 4</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Law enforcement authorities in Michigan continue to sift through the burned-out church that was the site of a deadly attack Sunday morning, leaving four people and the suspect dead and another eight victims injured.</p> <p>But Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said authorities are not aware of any other possible victims still missing.</p> <p>"We have not completed searching the church," Renye said during a Monday afternoon press conference. But as far as officials know, he added, "everyone has been accounted for."</p> <p>The attack unfolded Sunday morning during a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints service in Grand Blanc Township, located about 60 miles northwest of Detroit.</p>
<p>Law enforcement authorities say Thomas Jacob Sanford, a 40-year-old Marine veteran from nearby Burton, carried out the deadly attack. Sanford was killed in a shootout with police.</p> <p>The FBI, which is leading the investigation, is investigating the attack as an "act of targeted violence."</p> <p>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer thanked first responders for their swift actions and said her heart was breaking after another mass shooting in the state.</p>
<p>"We've seen gun violence in our schools, stores, parades, festivals and our houses of worship. These are places that we go to feel connected, to feel safe, to be together," she said. "But today, this place has been shattered by bullets and broken glass."</p> <p>The Grand Blanc Community Schools System said all of its 13 campuses would be closed Monday, ranging from pre-school to high school.</p> <h3 class="edTag">How it happened</h3> <p>Police say the Sunday service was interrupted when Sanford rammed his truck through the front doors of the church, exited his vehicle and began firing what authorities described as an assault rifle on the hundreds of worshippers inside.</p> <p>Sanford also intentionally set fire to the church using an accelerant — likely gasoline, officials said — causing the building to erupt in flames. Photos of the church after the attack showed a charred structure that had partially collapsed.</p>
<p>According to Renye, police officers responded to the scene of the attack Sunday morning within 30 seconds of the first emergency call going out. Within eight minutes of their arrival, Sanford was killed in a shootout with police.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>Who were the victims?</strong></h3> <p>Law enforcement officials have released little information about the victims.</p> <p>But Dr. Michael Danic, the medical chief of staff at Henry Ford Genesys Hospital, said his hospital has treated eight victims of the attack ranging in age from 6 to 78.</p> <p>Five of the patients were gunshot victims, including one who sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen and was in critical condition early Monday afternoon. The other three patients suffered from smoke inhalation.</p> <p>Danic said some hospital staffers were also members of the church.</p> <p>"We had a number of our [resident physicians] who are members of the church and were on site. Not only were they victims, they were also first responders," he said. "And having your friends and family come in injured, and taking care of them, is a really incredible experience."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Who was the attacker?</h3> <p>Sanford served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2004 to 2008, military officials confirmed to NPR. He completed one tour in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2007 and into 2008 with a combat logistics regiment and attained the rank of sergeant, the Marines said.</p> <p>Law enforcement officials have not speculated on Sanford's motive for Sunday's attack.</p> <p>Renye said Monday afternoon that investigators had interviewed over 100 victims and witnesses and were continuing to conduct interviews to get a clearer picture of what happened and why.</p>

<div class="article-title">Lawsuits against Tylenol's maker get a boost after Trump's comments</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>President Trump's announcement last week linking Tylenol with autism could play a role in ongoing legal cases against the company that makes it.</p> <p>One lawyer representing patients who say they were harmed by the drug says his firm has gotten an influx of more than a thousand calls this week from potential new clients asking for information.</p> <p>"A lot of inbound calls have come in, as you would expect now that a very bright spotlight has been put on this issue," says attorney Ashley Keller, whose firm Keller Postman is representing people in a product liability lawsuit against the drugmaker Kenvue.</p>
<p>The Trump administration's attention to the issue has also given the firm new ammunition in its appeal of the lawsuit, though the courts had effectively shot it down almost two years ago.</p> <p>The president, flanked by federal health officials, declared that acetaminophen, the generic name for Tylenol, "can be associated with a very increased risk of autism."</p> <p>During the press conference, officials said the Food and Drug Administration would begin the process of updating the safety label for Tylenol and acetaminophen.</p> <p>"So taking Tylenol is not good," the president told reporters. "All right. I'll say it. It's not good." He went on to suggest that pregnant women could "tough it out" if they have a fever and said there was "no downside" to not taking the pain medication.</p> <p>A later press release from the FDA was more measured and noted that although some studies found an "association" between the painkiller and autism, they had not established whether the painkiller in fact <em>caused </em>autism. The press release also said that acetaminophen is the only safe over-the-counter pain medication for pregnant women to take for fever, which can be harmful for a developing fetus.</p> <p>Keller says he filed what was among the first lawsuits alleging that prenatal acetaminophen exposure caused autism or ADHD. But in 2023, a judge ruled to exclude testimony from the experts he and his colleagues had gathered to help make their case. Judge Denise Cote of the Southern District of New York wrote that the experts "cherry picked" and misinterpreted the data they were relying on.</p>
<p>"I think the judge's other concern was that… the expert testimony was to claim that there was a causation, whereas the research itself never claims causation," says Sonia Suter, a professor who teaches law and medicine at the George Washington University School of Law and was not involved in the case. "So there was an inconsistency between the testimony for purposes of being an expert witness and exactly what the findings of the study showed."</p> <p>But since the Trump administration cited one of those experts, Dr. Andrea Baccarelli, in their announcement this week, Keller and his team are filing a new letter with the court to support their ongoing appeal.</p> <p>"One thing that I think is significant is that his scientific analysis was considered reliable enough for our nation's executive branch officials to credit," Keller says of Baccarelli. "And that's a pretty good sign that his scientific expertise was reliably applied. And so that could be a relevant consideration for the Court of Appeals."</p> <p>The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where Baccarelli is the dean, said he isn't available for interviews.</p> <p>Oral arguments in the appeal begin on Oct. 6, Keller says.</p> <p>However, legal experts aren't so sure the administration's announcement will make much difference to a judge because there's no new data.</p> <p>"I don't think it means that they have a better chance," says Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, where he created the Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law. "Nothing fundamentally has changed about the research. The science is the same today as it was last week and before all this nonsense."</p> <p>Product liability cases are tough to prove, he says. Ultimately, lawyers will have to prove causation, which hasn't yet been established.</p> <p>Still, that doesn't mean it won't cause a big headache for Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, which spun off from Johnson &amp; Johnson in 2023.</p>
<p>"I think there's something very dangerous about the president using his power to make statements that are not supported in the science," says Suter. "I think that is very dangerous for public health generally."</p> <p>As for Kenvue, it issued a statement saying it disagrees with any suggestion that taking acetaminophen causes autism, because decades of scientific research show that it is safe. The statement went on to note that "high fevers and pain are widely recognized as potential risks to a pregnancy if left untreated."<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Trump announces an agreement with Israel to end war in Gaza</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared together at the White House Monday where they pledged support for a U.S. plan to secure the release of remaining hostages and end the war in Gaza.</p> <p>"We're at a minimum, very, very close. And I think we're beyond very close," Trump said in a press conference alongside Netanyahu. "And I want to thank Bibi for really getting in there and doing a job."</p> <p>The announcement of a peace plan<strong> </strong>comes as the two-year anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel draws closer — and as a growing list of nations recognized Palestinian statehood last week during the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>Ahead of the meeting, the White House released its multi-point plan for peace. <em>[Scroll down to read the White House's plan.]</em> The 20-point plan would immediately end Israel's war in the territory, boost aid to Gaza, and require Hamas to release remaining Israeli hostages within 48 hours. A "Trump economic development plan" will be created to rebuild Gaza, including a special economic zone with preferred tariffs and access rates.</p> <p>"The hostages are coming back," Trump said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, who spoke next, said he supports Trump's plans, which he said "achieves our war aims."</p> <p>"I believe that today, we're taking a critical step towards both ending the war in Gaza and setting the stage for dramatically advancing peace in the Middle East, and I think beyond the Middle East and very important Muslim countries," Netanayhu said.</p> <p>Hamas has yet to accept the proposal and has resisted specific measures that are outlined in the proposal.</p> <p>"All military, terror and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt," the plan states.</p> <p>Unlike Trump's earlier comments to move Palestinians out of the region and redevelop the Gaza strip, the White House plan says Palestinians will be encouraged to stay and help "build a better Gaza."</p>
<p>"No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return," the plan states.</p> <p>Trump has been one of Netanyahu's strongest supporters, but he has grown more frustrated with the prime minister as the war has dragged on and the loss of lives has grown. Earlier this month, Trump claimed he was blindsided when Israel launched a strike against Hamas officials in Qatar, a key U.S. ally and mediator in ceasefire talks.</p> <p>A few hours before their joint press conference, Netanyahu called Qatar's Prime Minister Al Thani from the Oval Office and apologized for Israel's missile strike, the White House said in a statement.</p> <p>"He further expressed regret that, in targeting Hamas leadership during hostage negotiations, Israel violated Qatari sovereignty and affirmed that Israel will not conduct such an attack again in the future," the White House said in the statement.</p> <p>Trump said he expects Hamas will accept the plans, opining that it will likely be easier now that so many of its leaders have been killed by Israel.</p> <p>But if Hamas rejects the proposal, Trump said Israel would have his full backing to "finish the job" of destroying Hamas.</p> <p>"Everyone understands that the ultimate result must be the elimination of any danger posed in the region," Trump said. "And that danger is caused by Hamas."</p> <p>READ: President Donald J. Trump's Plan to End the Gaza Conflict</p> <ol class="edTag rte2-style-ol"><li>Gaza will be a deradicalized terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors.</li><li>Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough.</li><li>If both sides agree to this proposal, the war will immediately end. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal.</li><li>Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned.</li><li>Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1700 Gazans who were detained after October 7th 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans.</li><li>Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.</li><li>Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip. At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the January 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.</li><li>Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the January 19, 2025 agreement.</li><li>Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza. This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the "Board of Peace," which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J. Trump, with other members and heads of State to be announced, including Former Prime Minister Tony Blair. This body will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program, as outlined in various proposals, including President Trump's peace plan in 2020 and the Saudi-French proposal, and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza. This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment.</li><li>A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza.</li><li>A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries.</li><li>No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.</li><li>Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.</li><li>A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people.</li><li>The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A deconfliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties.</li><li>Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the Unites States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat.</li><li>In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF.</li><li>An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful co-existence to try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis by emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace.</li><li>While Gaza re-development advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.</li><li>The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence.</li></ol>

<div class="article-title">3 things to know about Trump's plan to send troops to Portland and Memphis</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>President Trump says he has ordered the deployment of troops to Portland, Ore., and that he's authorized them to use "full force" to curb protests outside U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.</p> <p>It's the latest instance of Trump deploying the military to various cities that he says are plagued with crime, with federal troops also expected to arrive in Memphis, Tenn., this week.</p> <p>On Monday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said the Department of Homeland Security is also looking to send troops to Chicago for protection of ICE agents and facilities, member station WBEZ reported. The governor added that the Illinois National Guard received a memo indicating that DHS requested about 100 military personnel. DHS and ICE did not respond to WBEZ's request for comment.</p>
<p>We break down what's going on, how officials in Portland and Memphis are responding, and how this fits into a larger picture.</p> <h3 class="edTag">1. Expect another legal fight</h3> <p>Like many of Trump's announcements, the Portland push started with a post on Saturday on his social media platform, Truth Social. He called Portland "war ravaged" — which is not the case on the ground there — and said he had authorized the Pentagon to provide troops.</p>
<p>"I am directing Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists," Trump wrote in the post. "I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary."</p> <p>It was unclear from that post what troops he meant. NPR reached out to the Pentagon for clarity on Saturday, and a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly said the Pentagon had not issued a deployment order for Portland and that it only learned of Trump's request from the media. That official also said it would be likely that National Guard troops would be used.</p> <p>All of this comes after there were reports of a ramp-up of federal officers at an ICE facility in Portland on Friday, which Mayor Keith Wilson called a show of force and told residents to remain calm and not react.</p>
<p>By Sunday, Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB) reported that the Trump administration called 200 members of the Oregon National Guard into federal service for a 60-day deployment, according to a memo from the Department of Defense to Gov. Tina Kotek. And hundreds of protesters gathered outside Portland's ICE facility late into Sunday night.</p>
<p>Both the governor of Oregon and the mayor of Portland dispute Trump's claims that the city is unsafe or in need of troops and have been urging residents to remain peaceful. OPB reported Sunday that Oregon's top officials and the city of Portland were filing a federal lawsuit arguing that the administration had overreached and acted unlawfully. In a press conference Saturday, Mayor Keith Wilson said the necessary troops needed for the city is zero.</p> <p>"This is an American city. We do not need any intervention. This is not a military target," he said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">2. Trump has been making these kinds of threats for months</h3> <p>In Washington, D.C., where Trump has federal control, more than 2,000 National Guard troops from a variety of states have been deployed for more than a month in what Trump has said is an effort to crack down on crime.</p> <p>Back in June, Trump also federalized California's National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes and deployed them along with the Marines to Los Angeles to quell protests against ICE deportations there. That sounds similar to what could happen in Portland.</p>
<p>And then there are a handful of cities that Trump has threatened — about a dozen at this point, all Democratically led. Places like Chicago, where he also used the war metaphor but has yet to actually send troops.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Trump posted online that Chicago was "about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR," referencing his call to rename the Defense Department.</p> <p>And then there is Memphis. Trump has authorized the use of the National Guard there as part of a similar crackdown, along with other federal agents who are all expected to start arriving as early as this week.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has described Memphis as "suffering from tremendous levels of violent crime that have overwhelmed its local government's ability to respond effectively."</p> <p>Memphis, which is the second-biggest city in Tennessee, is run by a Democratic mayor. Meanwhile, Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee has said he not only welcomed federal assistance, but that he has been in "constant communication" with the Trump administration for months about a plan to curb crime in Memphis using federal and state resources.</p> <h3 class="edTag">3. A larger picture is becoming clear</h3> <p>The National Guard is not trained for community policing or to make arrests, and that's not how they're generally used. In Washington, D.C., they've mainly been patrolling federal property and beautifying city parks.</p>
<p>Yet Trump says these National Guard deployments are to deal with crime. And he also has been conflating the work of troops with wider immigration and deportation efforts. We've seen that in Washington, D.C., for example, where ICE agents moved in along with the National Guard deployment and started detaining people at high rates.</p>
<p>Legal experts have also said that another part of this that has them worried is the normalization of troops — sometimes armed — on U.S. streets.</p>
<p>The U.S. has a long history of limiting the role of the military domestically, and experts say these kinds of continued threats and deployments challenge laws that are centuries old and central to the ideas that the U.S. was founded on.</p> <p>We have unpacked more about what experts tell us in this piece, and you can find more of our coverage on this wider issue here:</p>

<div class="article-title">The latest on the Michigan church shooting. And, Trump's new plan to end war in Gaza</div>

<p><em>Good morning. You're reading the Up First newsletter. </em>Subscribe<em> here to get it delivered to your inbox, and </em>listen<em> to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.</em></p> <h3 class="edTag">Today's top stories</h3> <p><strong>At least four people are dead and eight others have been hospitalized after a man drove his truck into a Mormon church and began shooting in Michigan yesterday morning.</strong> He then set the building on fire. An unknown number of people are unaccounted for, and authorities are searching the burnt shell of the church for more victims. The gunman, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, was killed after exchanging gunfire with two law enforcement officers.</p>
<ul class="edTag"><li>🎧 <strong>Sanford, a former U.S. Marine, lived in a small town about 20 minutes from the church</strong>, Michigan Public reporter Steve Carmody tells <em>Up First</em>. At this point in the investigation, a possible motive for the attack is unknown, as well as whether Sanford had any relationship with the church or someone who was attending the service, Carmody says. Today, more information is expected to be released about the victims and when the first funerals will be held. Carmody says people in the community have expressed shock and have been overwhelmed by the news.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Four top congressional leaders, two from each party, are scheduled to meet with President Trump today </strong>at the White House. This meeting comes ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government. Although Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Democrats are needed to help clear a 60-vote threshold in the Senate and avoid a government shutdown. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries were supposed to meet with Trump last week, but the president canceled, saying that he thought their demands were unreasonable. <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>🎧 <strong>Schumer and Jeffries, along with their Republican counterparts, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, will attend the meeting with Trump.</strong> NPR's Barbara Sprunt says she doesn't believe that Democrats' demands have shifted since last week's canceled meeting. Democrats want to undo some cuts to healthcare programs and make some expanded tax cuts from the Affordable Care Act permanent. If a shutdown were to happen, the White House has instructed agencies to prepare to lay off workers permanently.</li></ul> <p><strong>Trump is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today at the White House.</strong> The president has proposed a 21-point peace plan for Gaza. The U.S. is still negotiating the details with Israel and Arab countries. <br/></p>
<ul class="edTag"><li>🎧<strong> The proposal calls for Hamas to release all 48 of its remaining hostages, living and dead</strong>, a person briefed on the plan confirmed to NPR's Daniel Estrin. Once that demand is met, the plan calls for a gradual process where a multinational Arab and Muslim peacekeeping force enters Gaza while Israeli forces withdraw. Estrin says this is the most serious effort yet since Trump entered office to end the war and plan a postwar future for Gaza. There are some difficult points left to resolve, such as disarming Hamas and the role of the Palestinian Authority after the war. Notably, this is an Israel-U.S. negotiation and not an Israel-Hamas one, Estrin says. Next week will mark two years of the war in Gaza.</li></ul> <h3 class="edTag">Cost of living</h3>
<p><em>NPR's series </em><em>Cost of Living: The Price We Pay</em><em> is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. </em></p> <p>Home prices surged during the pandemic, and they have remained elevated. The median monthly payment for a home purchased in 2024 was $2,207, compared to $1,525 for a home bought in 2021, according to an analysis by Bankrate. The first two years of the pandemic saw low mortgage rates and work-from-home policies create a rush in homebuying, which led to a significant increase in home prices. In 2022, mortgage rates shot up and homebuying slowed significantly. Here's how the high housing prices have impacted people: <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>🏠 Some Americans have opted to have smaller families than they once envisioned to be able to make the price of housing and day care work.</li><li>🏠 Homeowners who bought a house before rates increased in 2022 locked in super low interest rates that they can keep forever. This has caused them to feel stuck in place, in a home that might not fit their needs anymore.</li><li>🏠 Some people who have bought homes in the last few years feel squeezed by monthly payments that leave little cash left over.</li><li>🏠 Many people who haven't bought a home are unsure when they will be able to afford one. High rents make it hard to save for a down payment.<br/></li></ul>

<p>Understanding the fundamentals of road safety may seem straightforward, but they are crucial for saving lives. In 2024, approximately 7,100 pedestrians were killed on the road, and more than 1,000 cyclists were hit and killed annually in recent years, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Ryan Sharp, a transportation consultant, and Julia Kite-Laidlaw, a pedestrian and cyclist safety advocate with the National Safety Council, share their top dos and don'ts for walkers and bikers with <em>Life Kit</em>: <br/></p> <ul class="edTag"><li>🚲 Look in all directions and turn around before walking or biking across a road. A driver might not see you in a crosswalk when turning into an intersection.</li><li>🚲 Always walk on the sidewalk or a walking path. If neither is an option, walk on the shoulder of the street against traffic so you can see oncoming vehicles and vice versa.</li><li>🚲 If biking at night, put white lights at the front and red lights at the back of your bike so cars can see you.</li><li>🚲 No listening to music or podcasts in your headphones or looking at your phone. This can distract and prevent you from hearing or seeing oncoming traffic.</li><li>🚲 Use turn signals when cycling. The easiest rules to remember are to keep the left arm straight out for a left turn and the right arm straight out for a right turn.</li></ul> <p><em>For more walking and biking safety tips, </em><em>listen to this episode of NPR's </em>Life Kit<em>.
