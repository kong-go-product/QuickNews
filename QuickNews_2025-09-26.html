<div class="article-title">North Carolina Dem says ‘no correlation’ between Charlotte train attack and accused killer’s repeated releases</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A North Carolina state representative is under fire for saying there is "no correlation" between the murder of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old refugee from Ukraine, and the fact that her accused killer had been released from jail 14 times.</p><p>State Rep. Marcia Morey, a longtime Democratic lawmaker and former judge, made the comments while defending the state’s bail system. Critics argue the system has allowed violent offenders to cycle in and out of custody with little accountability.</p><p>Decarlos Brown has been described by authorities as a dangerous career criminal who was repeatedly in and out of jail before he allegedly stabbed Zarutska to death on a light rail train in Charlotte. Many believe a broken bail system allowed him to remain free despite his violent record.</p><p>Morey, one of North Carolina’s most vocal advocates for bail reform, defended her comments and went on to condemn efforts to connect the case to bail policies.</p><p>"But don’t correlate what happened in January and a magistrate who set a bail according to guidelines to what happened in August. There is no correlation," she said during a legislative session.</p><p>Her argument has been countered by many lawmakers, who claim the tragedy shows exactly why it’s dangerous to allow repeat offenders back on the street.</p><p>Republican Senate Leader Phil Berger argued that bail reform measures designed to keep more defendants out of jail while awaiting trial are endangering public safety.</p><p>"Iryna should still be alive. She should be thriving and enjoying time with her family and friends," Berger said. "We cannot let North Carolina be held hostage by woke, weak-on-crime policies and court officials who prioritize criminals over justice for victims. We are also taking steps to revive the death penalty for those who commit the most heinous crimes."</p><p>However, supporters of bail reform argue the system unfairly punishes low-income defendants who cannot afford release.</p><p>Families of victims like Zarutska, on the other hand, believe the consequences are deadly when repeat offenders are given chance after chance.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Political violence on the rise. Is it time for a new domestic terrorism law?</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The media continue to bend over backward to avoid the overtly political nature of the murders of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson — while President Donald Trump has taken the step of "designating" Antifa as a terrorist organization.  </p><p>So, with political violence on the rise — undeniably from the left — will we finally see federal terrorism charges against domestic actors committing political violence on the home front? Will the likes of Tyler Robinson and Luigi Mangione now face federal terrorism charges?  </p><p>Alas, as the law is currently constructed, we will not.  </p><p>That should change. Not by simply "designating" domestic groups as terrorists; that actually won’t change anything when it comes to charging "domestic terrorism." </p><p>No, there’s a simpler, less politically charged means available. And the blueprint is already proven.  </p><p>Some background: The way the federal law is structured now, only foreign groups can be designated as "terrorists." The fear among legislators has been — and remains — that the ability to designate a domestic group as "terrorists" could be used as a cudgel by both sides of the political aisle.   </p><p>As a result, federal prosecutors twist themselves into pretzels to charge violent acts committed by politically inspired actors on the home front. Mangione’s federal murder prosecution, for instance, rests on the foundation of a weak stalking statute; as of this writing, any federal case against Robinson would likely look similar. </p><p>But is the process of "designation" — the pre-labeling of a group by the executive branch — actually necessary? Would it not be preferable to leave to the court process the decision as to whether violence committed for ideological purposes qualifies as "terrorism"?   </p><p>The model for how to do this exists already in the federal hate crime regime. Simply put, there are violent acts that qualify as "crimes-of-hate" if they are inspired by animus against certain groups on the basis of race, religion, etc.  </p><p>Whether you agree with hate crime statutes or not, they have survived legal scrutiny. So why not apply the same model to terrorism? </p><p>Here’s how it would go. First, there would be a list of various serious crimes that qualify. These would be either violent felony-level acts or the support or funding of such acts.  </p><p>Then, when charging that crime, the prosecutor would have to allege, and then prove, the perpetrator’s intention to influence government policy or coerce the civilian population (the federal definition of what constitutes "terrorism").  </p><p>And that’s it.  </p><p>In light of Robinson and Mangione, let’s use murder as an example. If the prosecutor can demonstrate that a murder has been committed with this requisite terroristic intent, the crime would then be charged as "murder as a crime of terrorism."  </p><p>Typically, the prosecutor would charge both regular "murder" and, also, the "murder as a crime of terrorism." If the judge decides there is not enough evidence for the "terrorism" charge, he can knock it out right at the beginning of the trial process.  </p><p>If the charge survives the judge, the prosecutor has to then prove the whole shebang to a jury — not just the murder charge, but also the terroristic intent behind the killing.  </p><p>This, in fact, is how New York’s state terrorism laws are structured — and it works. A state judge, in fact, just knocked out the terrorism piece in the Mangione case, but the regular murder charge survives. </p><p>So, why bother? If we can backdoor our way to at least some federal charges in many instances of political violence anyway, do we really need a new regime that invokes the "t" word?  </p><p>We do. As a society, we recognize that ideological murder is a crime against more than simply the individual victim. It also impacts society writ large, and cuts to the heart of our shared social contract.  </p><p>As such, these crimes should qualify for enhanced sentencing parameters, while, at the same time, taking politics out of the mix by letting a judge and jury control the process.  </p><p>Is there still potential for politicization here? Sure. But there always is in the criminal justice system. To pretend otherwise is foolhardy.  </p><p>But what is also foolhardy is witnessing events like the murders of Charlie Kirk and Brian Thompson — and pretending they were not committed for political purposes. </p><p>It’s past time to stop lying to ourselves. We have a domestic terrorism problem — and yes, despite the Biden administration’s endless invocations of "White supremacy," it is coming almost exclusively today from elements of an aggrieved, enraged left. </p><p>It’s time to charge it so. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">How US should respond after China rejects Trump nuclear talks, shows off new weapons at parade</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>China recently rejected President Donald Trump’s offer to discuss nuclear arms reductions. Then, shortly after, Beijing revealed new weapons in its World War II parade, a celebratory affair that Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un also enjoyed. </p><p>The parade included a variety of cutting-edge technologies, but the nuclear delivery systems stood out. The Chinese military showcased a full triad of improved capabilities: silo-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, an air-launched ballistic missile and a submarine-launched ballistic missile.</p><p>Just three years ago, China denied it was rapidly building up its nuclear arsenal. In 2022, Fu Cong, then the director-general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s arms control department (now China's permanent representative to the United Nations), told reporters that China was maintaining only a minimum deterrent necessary to defend itself. </p><p>Minimum deterrence is a strategy based on the assumption that a nation needs only to possess enough nuclear weapons to survive a first strike and credibly threaten a retaliatory strike sufficiently destructive in the mind of its adversary that the original act of aggression is deterred. Although the exact numbers that would meet those criteria are difficult to discern, the size of the force is modest.</p><p>China also continues to insist that it holds a no-first-use policy. This means it would not use a nuclear weapon against a nation first, but only in response to an attack. In theory, this policy would complement its alleged minimum deterrent strategy, but its nuclear investments belie both claims.</p><p>Four years ago, then Stratcom Commander Adm. Charles Richard publicly warned that it is more useful to watch what the Chinese are doing than what they were claiming. China was amid what he called a "strategic breakout." The military exercises between China and Russia were becoming more frequent, too, making what he described as "breathtaking" expansion even more alarming. </p><p>The Chinese were quickly expanding the size of their nuclear force and investing in diverse systems, and they were on a trajectory that suggested a challenge to the U.S. deterrent force, which is only designed to deter one major nuclear power, not two simultaneously. </p><p>Because of this, Adm. Richard concluded that, while it was impossible to know exactly how Xi Jinping might think about the purpose of the nuclear force, "what matters is they are building the capability to execute any plausible nuclear employment strategy – the last brick in the wall of a military capable of coercion."</p><p>Any successful act of coercion relies on a nation’s adversary believing that it has the capability and willingness to attack. And Beijing is working on a force to convince Washington of that. Not only is China building a large and diverse nuclear arsenal that can reach U.S. ships, bases and allies, it is mixing its nuclear and conventional weapons on dual-capable systems. And China’s strategic nuclear breakout is leading up to the time when U.S. officials have assessed China may try to take Taiwan by force (2027).</p><p>A 2024 annual Department of Defense report to Congress described China’s nuclear force as including "low-yield precision strike missiles to ICBMs with multi-megaton yields to provide it options at every rung of the escalation ladder." </p><p>That same report also said, "DoD estimates that the PRC will have over 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030, much of which will be deployed at higher readiness levels, and will continue growing its force to 2035 in line with its goal of ensuring [People’s Liberation Army] modernization is ‘basically complete’ that year, an important milestone on the road to Xi’s goal of a ‘world class’ military by 2049."</p><p>The report also noted that China will probably use its new fast breeder reactors and reprocessing facilities to produce plutonium for its nuclear weapons. Just like when China said it was keeping a minimum deterrent and a no-first-use policy, it was lying about this. Chinese officials claimed that these technologies are for peaceful purposes.</p><p>After China’s recent parade, I asked retired Adm. Richard what he made of it. He told me, "I think it's important to look at it in totality. They are advancing rapidly in all aspects necessary for a military designed for aggression." The new information, all publicly available, shows that the admiral was right when he sounded the alarm several years ago.</p><p>And while the nuclear expert community has found a consensus on the need to quickly modernize and adapt the U.S. nuclear force to deter Chinese aggression, decision-makers in the Pentagon have not fully grappled with this change. For example, the Biden administration did not make sufficient changes to field a nuclear deterrent force that could deter China and Russia simultaneously.</p><p>To preserve the peace, the Trump administration should do the following:</p><p>One, fully modernize the program of record by replacing its nuclear delivery systems; modernizing its warheads as well as U.S. nuclear command, control, and communications; and recapitalizing the nuclear enterprise infrastructure. </p><p>The total cost of this is disputed, but the upper range of the estimates is roughly 7% of the national defense budget, whose entire budget is less than 4% of the nation’s gross domestic product. To prevent nuclear war and preserve the peace, this is more than a bargain.</p><p>Two, formally terminate the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) with Russia, which expires in February 2026. Russia announced during its invasion of Ukraine that it would no longer abide by the treaty’s accounting requirements.</p><p>If the United States decides to stay within the confines of New START—when there is no way to determine if Russia is doing the same, and when China is completely unrestrained by a treaty – then Washington would be unilaterally restrained when it desperately needs to adapt its force to deter the growing Chinese arsenal.</p><p>President Trump understood the foolishness of remaining bound by the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty during his first term when Russia was cheating on it and formally withdrew from it. The same logic applies to New START today.</p><p>Three, bolster theater nuclear deterrence in the Pacific by speeding up the delivery of the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile (SLCM-N), a program President Trump initiated during his first term. The first Trump administration explained that it was adding this "prudent" option to enhance "the flexibility and diversity of U.S. nuclear capabilities… by signaling to potential adversaries that their limited nuclear escalation offers no exploitable advantage." </p><p>The Biden administration did not support President Trump’s initiative until the end of its term, losing significant time. Now President Trump has the ability to speed up efforts to deliver this critical capability in time to deter Chinese aggression. </p><p>Additionally, the next generation bomber, the B-21, will be instrumental for deterring China and assuring allies. And as its older cousin, the B-2, showed off against the illicit Iranian nuclear program in Operation Midnight Hammer, stealth bombers are a threat to the most deeply buried targets inside enemy territory. </p><p>The Air Force plans to produce 100 B-21s, but adding a second production line and doubling the production output would be wise. This would also bring down the cost per item while delivering a powerful deterrent that the president can use across geographic theaters.</p><p>China claims that it has a minimum deterrent, follows a no-first-use policy and uses nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. None of that is true. For the sake of peace, the United States should boost the credibility of its nuclear deterrence accordingly – and fast.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">'My first emotion was fear': Georgetown students react to flyers celebrating Charlie Kirk's murder</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> – Georgetown University students who spoke to Fox News Digital said they were afraid and disappointed when they saw flyers posted on campus Wednesday by a far-left group that approvingly referenced the killer of Charlie Kirk.</p><p>"My first emotion was fear," Jordan Van Slingerland, a senior international politics major, said on Thursday. "What happened to Charlie Kirk hit myself and, of course, many of my friends on this campus very hard, and seeing the text that was on the bullet of the assassin that had taken his life, certainly, was a bit scary."</p><p>While one student told Fox News Digital that the flyers were only posted for about 30 minutes on Wednesday before they were taken down, several more flyers were posted on campus the following night, including a photo of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated three weeks ago, with the slogans: "Follow your leader" and "Rest in p-ss Charlie." Video obtained by Fox News Digital showed a Georgetown University police officer removing the flyers Thursday. </p><p>"It made me feel very upset," Elizabeth Oliver, a Georgetown senior and president of the university's "Right to Life" group, told Fox News Digital in an interview. "Over the years, I've heard many hateful things against conservatives, and this was so blatant and in people's faces that it made me very worried for my other friends who share my similar beliefs."</p><p>The flyer was posted by the John Brown Gun Club, whom the Center for Counter Extremism has labeled a "far-left group." They contained the phrase, "Hey fascist! Catch!" – an apparent nod to the slogan authorities say was etched in a shell casing found near the bolt-action rifle allegedly used to assassinate Kirk at Utah Valley University.</p><p>The group is named for militant slave abolitionist John Brown and the flyer also referred to their organization as "the only political group that celebrates when Nazis die" on the flyers. </p><p>Matthew Cosenza, a Georgetown freshman, said the flyer caught his eye when it went viral on X on Wednesday. </p><p>"I really wasn't that surprised to see material like that on campus," Cosenza said. "I've seen other material that likens Trump to Hitler, the conservatives to fascists and the conservative movement on campus to Nazism."</p><p>Senior Rowan O'Sullivan also was not surprised.</p><p>"Certainly, it's out-of-control," O'Sullivan said. "But I think it's pretty obvious that whatever version of leftism, whatever you want to call this is, I think is, to some degree, window dressing for bloodlust at the end of it, and you saw that with the reactions to Charlie Kirk's death."</p><p>As the director of Campus Affairs for Georgetown's College Republicans chapter and a board member for conservative groups on campus, Van Slingerland said he has been threatened with political violence since President Donald Trump was elected. </p><p>"The climate has certainly been very hostile here for conservative students since then," Van Slingerland said. </p><p>After Shae McInnis, a sophomore at Georgetown University and treasurer of the school's College Republicans club, spoke to Fox News Digital, O'Sullivan said he "has been identified by these left-wing groups on anonymous campus messaging platforms," and students "have been spreading lies and fabrications about him."</p><p>"I've heard from many people that they don't want to get involved in groups like debate societies," Oliver said. "This anonymous attacking from people, where you don't know where it's coming from, is very scary. So many people are deterred from even sharing their beliefs in classrooms."</p><p>Georgetown released a statement on Thursday affirming the campus has "no tolerance for calls for violence or threats to the university."</p><p>"The flyers have been removed, and the university is investigating this incident and working to ensure the safety of our community," Georgetown University said. </p><p>But students said the administration could do more to deter this type of violent rhetoric. </p><p>"I would love to see the university distinguish itself from other elite universities in the United States, which have all completely succumbed to leftism and have rotted from the inside out," O'Sullivan said. </p><p>While defending the right to free speech, O'Sullivan argued that Georgetown is a private institution, and "if the school had any spine, they would absolutely condemn it and come down hard, and not just send us an email."</p><p>Two students who spoke to Fox News Digital said they were concerned the Trump administration would cut their federal funding in response to the flyer. </p><p>Cash Moore, a Georgetown sophomore and a member of the College Democrats club, said that when he first saw the poster in a group chat, he felt "disappointment" that some students view violence as acceptable.</p><p>"The first thing I thought was a little disappointment that some people, perhaps on this campus, hold that violence is something that is productive in society," Moore said.</p><p>However, he said he is concerned that the Trump administration’s attention to the flyer could put a "target" on the university."</p><p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon posted a statement on Wednesday condemning the "appalling posters" and urging the university to "determine what it stands for as an institution."</p><p>"ED officials have spoken to Georgetown administrators, who made the decision to remove the flyers. Campus police are investigating the incident and will deploy resources to protect students as necessary. Allowing violent rhetoric to fester on our nation’s campuses without consequences is dangerous. It must be condemned by institutional leaders," McMahon said. </p><p>"I think one of the things I am worried about is, is Trump going to target us next?" Moore asked. </p><p>When reached for comment regarding the students' fears of retaliation, White House spokesperson Liz Huston told Fox News Digital, "This despicable act at Georgetown underscores just how mainstream political violence has become on the left and why Charlie Kirk’s work on college campuses was so important."</p><p>"Through debate, Charlie taught students how to think critically and engage across differences. Americans should continue to live by the same principles as Charlie – speaking the truth, fostering real dialogue, and loving your country," the White House added. </p><p>Referencing Trump's speech at Kirk's memorial on Sunday when he said, "I hate my opponents," Moore told Fox News Digital that it's "valid for the left to also feel afraid."</p><p>Moore said he has only seen the left take steps to condemn the violence and that "a lot of the escalation is coming from the right, not just a few crazy people putting up posters on the left."</p><p>"We do have a free speech right on this campus, and I think that’s something a lot of us value and, obviously, a call to violence isn’t something that should take place, but there also is that free speech aspect that's important to acknowledge," he said.</p><p>Max Wolff-Merovick, a sophomore and a member of the school’s largest debating society, said he believes the flyers were put up by "a small group of students" in an attempt to spark outrage rather than to promote a student club.</p><p>"It’s unequivocally bad to be emulating the rhetoric of a political assassin," Wolff-Merovick said. "That’s not something that anyone should be doing. But it also struck me as something that was more intended to provoke outrage on purpose rather than a serious attempt at creating a student organization as it's been characterized by a number of different people."</p><p>Wolff-Merovick said that "this does not represent the student body" at the school.</p><p>"Certainly I feel for it, but I think, at the same time, we need to be grounded in reality and know that this does not represent the student body at Georgetown as a whole, much less the left in general," he said.</p><p>Wolff-Merovick said both sides "could do a better job at universally calling to turn the temperature down."</p><p>Jonathan Rothschild, a student at Georgetown University, said free speech should remain protected, but political violence "should not be glorified."</p><p>"If it is not a direct call to violence, I think the Georgetown University administration, to protect free speech, should leave it up, even though I personally find it abhorrent," Rothschild said, adding that most students on campus oppose political violence.</p><p>"I think everyone with common sense should be against political violence," he said.</p><p>Georgetown University did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. </p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Peter D'Abrosca contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">EXCLUSIVE: Immigration agent reveals ‘biggest fear’ after deadly anti-ICE shooting</div>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>: After a fatal anti-ICE shooting in Dallas this week, a special federal agent working on deportations revealed that their "biggest fear" is that they will be left stranded by sanctuary jurisdictions in the face of third-party rioters "who have been riled up to believe that I'm kidnapping somebody."</p><p>In an interview with Fox News Digital, the agent, who works in New England, said that interference from protesters who have been radicalized by Democrats’ anti-ICE rhetoric has become a regular occurrence.</p><p>Amid these interferences, the agent said that they receive very little support from local and state law enforcement, whose hands are tied due to Democratic-passed sanctuary policies. The result is an extremely tense situation, which the agent fears could get out of hand at any moment.</p><p>"My biggest fear is third parties who have been riled up to believe that I'm kidnapping somebody, I'm taking away their rights, and I'm destroying somebody's life for no reason, being present when this happens and trying to interfere with what we're doing, because that gets dangerous, it really does," the agent explained.</p><p>"One of our biggest fears," the agent went on, "is, let's say we go and there's 3 or 4 of us, and we stop a guy, and then crowds come out, and the crowds become violent, or they become really aggressive, they impede our jobs."</p><p>According to the Department of Homeland Security, ICE agents are facing a 1,000% increase in assaults.</p><p>The danger is especially acute in sanctuary jurisdictions, the agent said, because there, "local police will not help us all the time."</p><p>"It’s very dependent on where that ICE facility sits, how it's going to be treated," they explained.</p><p>In New England, the agent said that some law enforcement agencies "do not want to help us with anything."</p><p>"They'll have nothing to do with it," the agent said. "That gets very, very stressful."</p><p>Because of this lack of support, the agent said that situations with rioters or protesters are significantly more dangerous.</p><p>"That means it's fight or flight at that time," the agent explained. "They're yelling at me, at the same time, they're attracting the attention of other people, but I'm trying to focus on getting this person handcuffed, processed, interviewing them, determining their alienage while someone's yelling at me or someone's getting in my face … I don't know if they have weapons, I don't know if they're on drugs and they're going to attack me. I don't know all this."</p><p>While some Democrats have vilified ICE agents, accusing them of racially profiling people, using "Gestapo tactics" and "terrorizing" communities, the agent likened their job to an "investigative reporter" working within the confines of U.S. federal law.</p><p>"I prove and disprove allegations; I have tools to do it. I have search warrants. I have grand jury subpoenas, I do interviews, I do surveillance, I do record checks, that's what I do. When you boil everything down in the simplest terms, I'm not trying to do riots," the agent said.</p><p>They shared that when one of their colleagues explained to a protester what ICE agents really do with illegals, she was shocked.</p><p>"He was explaining to her, ‘We're not going to harm this guy.’ She's like, ‘Oh, he's going to disappear,’ and all the stupid talking points, no due process, this and that. And he took the time to explain to her that he's going to get to call his family, he's going to get a call with a lawyer, and he'll see a judge. She was like, ‘Well, I didn't know all that.' This is what they're telling me. That's what we're dealing with."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">I’m a gender detransitioner. I told the FTC how doctors abused their power over me</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>This summer, I, alongside several fellow detransitioners, spoke to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) about how the medical establishment lied to us as children.   We were told we could become members of the opposite sex if only we took the puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones they prescribed us and underwent surgeries to remove healthy body parts.  </p><p>That was a lie. No one can switch sexes.   </p><p>Our parents were told we would kill ourselves if they didn’t sign on to these medical and surgical regimens. </p><p>That was a lie, too. There is no evidence that transgender-identifying people commit suicide if they are not affirmed, despite activists’ claims to the contrary. </p><p>The FTC’s job is to go after "unfair and deceptive practices" in trade — and what I have experienced from the medical establishment is about as unfair and deceptive as it gets. After hearing stories like mine, the agency is requesting comments from those harmed by gender-affirming care, and I’m calling on all Americans adversely affected by this ideology to join me in telling the FTC their stories. </p><p>I’ll start with mine. </p><p>After all those so-called "treatments" doctors gave me — which would be better described as interference with our bodies’ natural processes — I was left with a long list of medical issues that no woman should have to suffer. </p><p>When I was just 17, doctors put me on testosterone, which is not meant for female bodies in such high doses. The hormone, as a result, caused damage to my healthy endocrine system that persists years after stopping testosterone: I now suffer from vaginal atrophy, sexual dysfunction, chronic pain and a weakened voice that I can no longer use to sing.  </p><p> Additionally, the testosterone made it so my pubescent body was also never allowed to develop properly, leaving my hips smaller than they otherwise would have been, which made pregnancy extremely painful. I was forced to deliver my son via C-section because doctors’ interference with my healthy body made vaginal delivery impossible. </p><p>The medical establishment also thought it acceptable to amputate my healthy breasts, in what I later realized was a botched procedure. When performing a double mastectomy on me, the surgeon cut off my nipples, cut them up to reshape them into a supposedly more "masculine" shape, and sewed them on in the wrong place. Not only did this surgeon take away my choice to breastfeed — as I was recovering from my C-section, the milk I was supposed to be able to feed my son was trapped in my chest, leading to intense pain. </p><p>All of this was done on me despite the fact that doctors knew I was mentally ill, likely suffering from borderline personality disorder and having been diagnosed as a child with anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, suicidal ideations and depression. The idea that putting me through irreversible chemical and surgical changes would make me better is absurd on its face, and, yet, was given a big thumbs up by the medical establishment — which has its own incentives to do so.   </p><p>Indeed, beyond ideology, there is a financial motive here for them. For the rest of my life, I will be forced to pay the same medical establishment that harmed me in order to deal with the side effects that they caused me in the name of "care." Meanwhile, for those doctors and surgeons, my case is a double profit: charge patients for hormones and surgeries and then charge patients again to manage whatever injuries those hormones and surgeries caused. </p><p>This is essentially the gender industry’s business model, one that rakes in cash for hospitals and pharma while destroying our bodies in the process. This cannot be left to stand. While I and other detransitioners may be dependent on the system that caused us great medical harm, no one else should have to go through this.  </p><p>Thankfully, the FTC is standing up for us — and all the Americans who could get trapped by the medical industry as I did. It is deceit when doctors call this butchery "care," and they should not be able to get away with it. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Seahawks stave off Cardinals with game-winning field goal in thrilling win on the road</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Seattle Seahawks held off their NFC West rival, the Arizona Cardinals, in a 23-20 victory on the road on Thursday night.</p><p>The Seahawks improved to 3-1 to start the early season, while the Cardinals fell to 2-2. </p><p>There wasn’t much coming from the Cardinals’ offense in this game, but the fourth quarter made the game very interesting as Kyler Murray finally got some momentum going. </p><p>Marvin Harrison Jr., who was having a rough game at that point, was trusted by Murray on a pass to the end zone, and he hauled it in over Seahawks cornerback Devon Witherspoon to make it a one-score game after the extra point. </p><p>Sam Darnold and the Seahawks, owning a 20-13 lead, knew they could seal victory with a long drive, killing clock and making it a two-score game. It looked like that was coming when Jaxon Smith-Njigba caught a 36-yard pass on third-and-6 to get into Cardinals territory. </p><p>But three plays later, Jason Myers was trying a 53-yard field goal and he missed wide right to keep the Cardinals’ hopes alive. And Murray delivered the drive his team needed to tie it up. </p><p>The Cardinals went 12 plays and 57 yards in just under three minutes, as running back Emari Demercado was wide open on second-and-goal and he ran into the end zone for the tie following the extra point with 28 seconds left to play in regulation. </p><p>There was a slim chance Darnold could get Myers back in his field goal range to try a game-winner, but that all changed when Chad Ryland’s kickoff attempt failed to get into the designated landing zone between the goal line and the 20-yard line. The ball bounced just before the 20-yard line, giving Seattle the ball at their own 40-yard line. </p><p>Darnold got the ball onto Arizona’s side thanks to a perfect pass to Smith-Njigba for a 22-yard gain. After a Zach Charbonnet four-yard run, Myers had another chance from almost the same distance as he lined up a 52-yarder. </p><p>This time, it was true as the Seahawks celebrated their victory in a big divisional matchup. </p><p>As noted, this game wasn’t an offensive thriller as both defenses were playing their opponents well. However, Darnold was able to orchestrate two touchdown drives, finding tight end A.J. Barner from 16 yards out for the team’s first points on the scoreboard, while Charbonnet ran one in at the goal line in the second quarter to head into the locker room with a 14-3 lead. </p><p>Both teams would find a field goal in the third quarter before the fourth turned this game into a thriller. </p><p>Looking at the stat sheet, Darnold was 18-of-26 for 242 yards with his touchdown pass and no interceptions, with Smith-Njigba leading the way with 79 yards on just four catches. Kenneth Walker III may not have found the end zone, but he did lead the rushing attack with 81 yards on 19 carries compared to Charbonnet’s 39 yards on 12 touches in the backfield. </p><p>As for the Cardinals, Murray was 27-of-41 with two touchdown passes and two interceptions thrown, including one that luckily went back to Arizona after Cobe Bryant ran into his own Seahawks teammate and fumbled while returning the pick. Harrison was the leading receiver with 66 yards on six catches. </p><p>Trey Benson, who will be filling in for James Conner the remainder of the season after his year-ending foot injury last week, had 35 yards on just eight carries in his first game as the team’s primary running back. He also had five catches from Murray for 19 yards. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Georgetown University said it removed a second wave of inflammatory posters mocking the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and has reported the incident to the FBI. </p><p>Photos of the flyers at the elite Washington, D.C., university, including one that showed Kirk’s face with his eyes blacked out and the words "Follow your leader" and "Rest in p-ss Charlie," were first obtained by Fox News.</p><p>The posters were taped up Thursday night in Georgetown’s central Red Square, the school’s main free speech zone. They also carried QR codes and the seal of the "Georgetown John Brown Club," a group tied to leftist activism and past violence.</p><p>"Georgetown University has no tolerance for calls for violence or threats to the university," a university spokesperson told Fox News Digital. </p><p>"Upon discovering the new flyers, the university removed them and reported them to the FBI. The university’s team of safety and security experts, including its police department and specialized threat assessment professionals, will continue to investigate this incident and work in partnership with law enforcement to ensure the safety of our community."</p><p>Shae McInnis, treasurer of the Georgetown College Republicans, told Fox News Digital he was taken aback by the flyers' reappearance on campus. </p><p>"Just even more shocked than I was [Wednesday]… it really makes me feel like our entire university is under attack by people with no decency and no respect for our society," he said.</p><p>McInnis said conservative students are now openly questioning whether it is even safe to host events on campus. </p><p>"Should I go out to this event? Should we have a Georgetown College Republicans event? Is that even safe now?" he asked. But, he added, his group refuses to back down: "They’re trying to shut us up, but we’re not going to. We’re going to be bolder, be louder and proclaim our message with confidence."</p><p>U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon condemned the flyers Wednesday, writing on X that violent rhetoric on campus "must be condemned by institutional leaders."</p><p>The first round of posters appeared on Wednesday and used the slogan "Hey fascist! Catch!" </p><p>Accused assassin Tyler Robinson used the same phrase etched onto the shell casing in Charlie Kirk’s Sept. 10 killing at Utah Valley University. Those same flyers also declared, "The only political group that celebrates when Nazis die," alongside a QR code linking to the John Brown Gun Club.</p><p>McInnis said Thursday’s posters marked a clear escalation. </p><p>"[Wednesday] there were fewer posters on a less prominent area of campus. Today, they went to what’s called ‘Red Square,’ the main free speech zone… They went in broad daylight… They’re being even more brash."</p><p>He warned the rhetoric has already chilled free speech on campus. "How can people be safe to express themselves freely if they know their classmates could be wanting to kill them, literally kill them for expressing their own ideas?"</p><p>The John Brown Gun Club, cited in the Georgetown flyers, is classified as a far-left group by the Center for Counter Extremism. It has been linked to violence, including a July 4, 2025, armed attack on an ICE detention center in Texas that left an officer injured, and the 2019 attempted firebombing of an ICE facility in Tacoma, Washington, where attacker Willem van Spronsen was killed.</p><p>McInnis called for swift accountability. </p><p>"The university should identify every student involved, and they must be immediately expelled… If the university is not willing to do that, I would urge the federal government to please help," he said. "Please protect conservative students at Georgetown and across every campus in our country."</p><p>McMahon and the FBI did not immediately return Fox News Digital's additional request for comment Thursday.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Peter D'Abrosca, Kiera McDonald, and Andrew Murray contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Vice President JD Vance said he would "love" Jimmy Kimmel to apologize to Erika Kirk and the people he "slandered" after the late-night host returned to the airwaves Tuesday after a brief suspension.</p><p>Kimmel’s show was pulled from the air after his comments on Charlie Kirk’s death drew backlash from conservatives and Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr, who warned the agency could take regulatory action.</p><p>"He [Kimmel] tries to say that he told a joke. He didn't tell a joke. He was actually accusing right-wing America, conservative America, of killing Charlie Kirk. We now know that is false. Charlie Kirk was murdered by a left-wing assassin who was radicalized by some of the rhetoric that we see coming from the far-Left," Vance said Thursday during an interview on "The Ingraham Angle."</p><p>"When you accuse the people who've been holding prayer vigils, who have been praying about Charlie Kirk, you accuse them of killing Charlie Kirk, when we know as a left-wing assassin, you're actually apologizing for his murder, you're encouraging more of that violence to happen."</p><p>The vice president continued: "If we're going to stop this crazy strain of left-wing violence, we have to be honest about what it is, and the honest truth is that Charlie Kirk was not killed by a MAGA American. He was not killed by a Republican. He was killed by a left-wing radical. Let's be honest about that fact, so that we can stop it from happening."</p><p>Kimmel’s Sept. 15 remarks criticized the Republican response to Kirk’s assassination, accusing the "MAGA gang" of trying to politicize it by portraying the shooter as "anything other than one of them" to score "political points."</p><p>Kirk’s alleged assassin, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, surrendered to police and was charged with aggravated murder, two counts of obstruction of justice, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, among others. </p><p>A family member of Robinson told investigators that he had "become more political in recent years" and disliked Kirk’s views, according to Utah Gov. Spencer Cox.</p><p>"Clearly there was a lot of gaming going on — friends that have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet, the Reddit culture, and these other dark places of the internet where this person was going deep," Cox told NBC’s "Meet the Press."</p><p>Kimmel’s first monologue since his return has drawn more than 21 million views on YouTube as of Thursday evening, and averaged 6.2 million viewers, according to The New York Times.</p><p>His show is still being preempted by Nexstar Media and Sinclair, which own ABC-affiliated television stations. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Trump reacted to the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, telling Fox News Digital during an exclusive interview that he "placed a cloud over the entire nation" with the bureau’s "Crossfire Hurricane" probe.</p><p>Comey, on Thursday evening, was indicted by a grand jury on two counts, alleged false statements within jurisdiction of the legislative branch and obstruction of congressional proceeding.</p><p>"What they did was so terrible and so corrupt," Trump told Fox News Digital, referring to those involved in the Trump-Russia probe. "We had a great administration, though."</p><p>Former Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok formally opened the Trump-Russia investigation, known inside the bureau as "Crossfire Hurricane" on July 31, 2016.</p><p>Trump fired Comey in May 2017. Days later Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to take over the Crossfire Hurricane probe.</p><p>"He is a very corrupt person. He was absolutely a terrible man for what this country stood for," Trump told Fox News Digital.</p><p>"Comey placed a cloud over the entire nation, and actually, the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax made it very difficult," Trump said. "It could have caused wars."</p><p>Fox News Digital exclusively reported in July that Comey was under criminal investigation by the FBI. </p><p>Fox News Digital also exclusively reported that former CIA Director John Brennan is under criminal investigation related to the Trump–Russia probe. </p><p>When asked whether Brennan should be charged as well, the president told Fox News Digital: "We’ll have to see what happens."</p><p>"It is up to the Justice Department, but I can tell you, it is a group of people that was very disappointing," the president said. "This makes Watergate look like peanuts." </p><p>He added: "They tried to destroy our country."</p><p>Comey's case is being handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.</p><p>The indictment alleges that Comey obstructed a congressional investigation into the disclosure of sensitive information in violation of 18 USC 1505.</p><p>The indictment also alleges Comey made a false statement when he stated he did not authorize someone at the FBI to be an anonymous source. According to the indictment, that statement was false. </p><p>His arraignment is set for 10 a.m. on Oct. 9, in Alexandria Courtroom 600 before District Juge Michael S. Nachmanoff.</p><p>"No one is above the law," Attorney General Pam Bondi said on X. "Today’s indictment reflects this Department of Justice’s commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case."</p><p>FBI Director Kash Patel took to X to say, "Today, your FBI took another step in its promise of full accountability."</p><p>"For far too long, previous corrupt leadership and their enablers weaponized federal law enforcement, damaging once proud institutions and severely eroding public trust," Patel wrote. "Every day, we continue the fight to earn that trust back, and under my leadership, this FBI will confront the problem head-on. Nowhere was this politicization of law enforcement more blatant than during the Russiagate hoax, a disgraceful chapter in history we continue to investigate and expose.</p><p>"Everyone, especially those in positions of power, will be held to account – no matter their perch."</p><p>Meanwhile, after nearly two years, former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, which concluded in March 2019, yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Shortly after, John Durham was appointed as special counsel to investigate the origins of the "Crossfire Hurricane" probe.</p><p>Durham found that the FBI "failed to act" on a "clear warning sign" that the bureau was the "target" of a Clinton-led effort to "manipulate or influence the law enforcement process for political purposes" ahead of the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>"The aforementioned facts reflect a rather startling and inexplicable failure to adequately consider and incorporate the Clinton Plan intelligence into the FBI’s investigative decision-making in the Crossfire Hurricane investigation," Durham’s report states.</p><p>"Indeed, had the FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation as an assessment and, in turn, gathered and analyzed data in concert with the information from the Clinton Plan intelligence, it is likely that the information received would have been examined, at a minimum, with a more critical eye," the report continued.</p><p>Durham, in his report, said the FBI "failed to act on what should have been — when combined with other incontrovertible facts — a clear warning sign that the FBI might then be the target of an effort to manipulate or influence the law enforcement process for political purposes during the 2016 presidential election."</p><p>In an Instagram post on Thursday, Comey acknowledged that he and his family have known for years that there are costs to standing up to President Donald Trump.</p><p>"We couldn’t imagine ourselves living any other way," he said.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>United Nations Ambassador Mike Waltz on Thursday called mishaps during President Donald Trump’s U.N. speech "unacceptable" and vowed to withhold U.S. funding until sweeping reforms are made.</p><p>Waltz appeared on FOX Business’ "Kudlow" when host Larry Kudlow asked him about the incidents that appeared as if the U.N. was trying to sabotage the president.</p><p>Kudlow noted that the escalator malfunctioned as Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrived, the teleprompter later failed, and finally the auditorium sound cut out.</p><p>Waltz added that the broadcast audio abruptly switched to Portuguese during Trump’s speech before returning to English.</p><p>"The whole thing is unacceptable. The whole thing stinks," Waltz said. "There’s 150 world leaders there and this only happens to him, not once, not twice, but three times."</p><p>He said the incidents are under investigation by the Secret Service and noted the Secretary General has pledged full cooperation.</p><p>"As the ambassador, I said, you’ve got to open your doors, and some people were kind of shoulder shrugging at this," Waltz said. "This could have been incredibly serious. It’s insulting, and it’s right here on American soil."</p><p>Waltz then turned to reform, criticizing the U.N.’s bloated bureaucracy and noting that seven agencies focus on climate issues alone. He argued the organization needs to be "cut up" and reformed before U.S. taxpayer money flows again.</p><p>He confirmed the U.S. has withheld its U.N. contribution this year.</p><p>"We've withheld this year," Waltz said. "We haven't paid any and my first meeting with the Secretary General was, here are the reforms that we need to see before you start talking about taxpayer dollars."</p><p>Waltz invoked Sen. Jesse Helms’ 1999 push to clean up the U.N. before releasing U.S. dollars, saying transparency and accountability remain essential.</p><p>"We have every obligation to make sure it's transparent," he said.</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Going out does not necessarily mean heading to a nightclub.  'DJ Harley Wav' is pumping up partiers at a daytime coffee clubbing event in Chicago.  Events like these are popping up all over the country as Gen Z shifts away from alcohol-centered events, opting instead for quieter partying, known as 'soft clubbing.'  "We try to make it look like a party. We're trying to shift from sort of nightlife into day life. There are so many opportunities to connect with people that aren't just drinking," says Hannah Eyre who co-founded the 'Savannah Ice Tub Club.'  Eyer's events feature an hour-long yoga class followed by an ice tub plunge and sauna session. The concept was born from a desire to connect with people in a healthy, mindful way. And she adds the events offer, "A space for people to be able to show up, to be be able meet new people that are like-minded."  Eyre says, "It just grew into sort of this larger thing that's a part of this large trend towards sobriety and wellness."</p><p>According to Eyre, the roughly 100 to 150 brave participants get a lot of health benefits from dipping in the ice baths, especially if you can submerge yourself in the icy waters for two and a half minutes. "It's good for your inflammation, it's good for your circulation," she adds that it's been beneficial to her too, "the ones that I have seen personally that keep me coming back have been all mental health benefits."</p><p>As younger Americans prioritize mental health, better sleep, and physical fitness, data shows 61% of Gen Zers want to drink less, indicating it's a deeper cultural shift, not just a 'sober curious' trend.  Highlighting this, event ticking site, Eventbrite is seeing a 92% increase in sober gatherings, redefining the traditional night out with a fusion of wellness, music, and authentic community connections.  Eyre enthusiastic about the emerging trend, "It's nice to get to see more and more opportunities for connection beyond drinking or being at the bar."  </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Harris resurrects campaign word salad when concerned pregnant mom asks about raising a son under Trump</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> Former Vice President Kamala Harris tried to quell a nine-month-pregnant mom's concerns over having a baby boy under the Trump administration, resurrecting a campaign phrase celebrating the "children of the community."</p><p>"Part of how I was raised to think about things was that the children of the community are our children of the community. And we all have some, I think, responsibility — you can call it a moral responsibility, you can think of it in different ways — but to be invested in their well-being and success," Harris said Wednesday evening from The Town Hall theater venue in Midtown Manhattan. </p><p>Harris was in New York City to launch her book tour to promote "107 Days," which offers a detailed and personal retelling of her days on the 2024 presidential campaign trail after then-President Joe Biden dropped out amid mounting concerns over his mental acuity. </p><p>Harris only took a couple questions from the audience, including one from a nine-month-pregnant mom who was concerned about raising a son with a "good heart and moral compass" under "this current political climate."</p><p>Harris quelled the mom's concerns by reassuring her she would teach her son how to be "strong," which would catapult him to "role model" status as an adult. </p><p>"To teach that our own children, that that is the way that we expect that they will live, which is to see the connection between themselves and others, to see the interdependence between themselves and others, and to have a sense of understanding that it's a sign of strength to lift other people up," she continued. </p><p>Harris argued that President Donald Trump has a "perverse notion" that strength is measured by "who you beat down," which she rejected. </p><p>"I used to talk about it a lot in those 107 days, which is this perverse notion that is absolutely being pushed by this guy in the White House, which is to suggest that the measure of strength is based on who you beat down," she said. "Instead, what I think everyone here understands, which is the true measure of strength, is based on who you lift up." </p><p>Harris added that she was excited about the future of the unborn baby under his mom's leadership. </p><p>"You're going to teach him to be strong in every way that is important, and he will be a role model," she continued. "And we are very, very excited for the future of that child." </p><p>Harris repeatedly has used the phrase "the children of the community are the children of the community" while speaking during public events, including as vice president and when she was running for the presidency in 2024. </p><p>Conservative critics and others frequently mocked Harris' "word salad" comments during the election cycle, including in September 2024 when she tied inflation to her "children of the community" phrase. </p><p>"I grew up understanding the children of the community are the children of the community, and we should all have a vested interest in ensuring that children can go grow up with the resources that they need to achieve their God-given potential," Harris said, explaining she wanted to lower the cost of groceries for struggling families and vowing to take on big corporations who gouged customers. </p><p>Harris kicked off her book tour in New York City before traveling to cities from coast to coast to promote her new book, which was released Tuesday. </p><p>Her roughly hourlong conversation Wednesday evening included taking a few shots at Trump, as well as celebrating how former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served as her mentor and supporter throughout the 2024 election. </p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>James Comey, the former FBI Director, was indicted on felony charges of obstruction and perjury Thursday, igniting fierce reactions across the nation and political spectrum.</p><p>The charges, announced by newly appointed U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan in the Eastern District of Virginia, relate to his 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. </p><p>Halligan framed the indictment as a matter of accountability, declaring it "a breach of public trust at an extraordinary level" and emphasizing that "no one is above the law." </p><p>If convicted, Comey faces up to five years in prison.</p><p>The announcement sparked reaction with the fastest coming through from the president and his allies.</p><p>President Donald Trump has long demanded Comey’s prosecution since firing him in 2017 and railing against the Russia investigation he oversaw.</p><p>Trump celebrated the news with a triumphant post on his Truth Social account.</p><p>"JUSTICE IN AMERICA! One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI. Today he was indicted by a Grand Jury on two felony counts for various illegal and unlawful acts. He has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" the president wrote.</p><p>Attorney General Pam Bondi also issued a sharp statement on X declaring, "No one is above the law. The American people deserve justice after years of lies and political interference."</p><p>FBI Director Kash Patel amplified that opinion and cast the indictment as part of a broader effort to restore trust in the bureau. </p><p>"Today, your FBI took another step in its promise of full accountability," he wrote. </p><p>"For far too long, corrupt leadership weaponized federal law enforcement, damaging once proud institutions and eroding public trust. Under my leadership, this FBI will confront the problem head-on. No one is above the law."</p><p>U.S. Senator John Cornyn responded noting the gravity of Comey's offenses.</p><p>"While our legal system provides for the presumption of innocence, Comey’s accountability for FBI abuses during the first Trump term are long overdue," he said. "These charges are serious offenses, especially if committed by the head of our nation’s top law enforcement agency, and there must be consequences for any crimes."</p><p>Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called it "a long-awaited correction to years of corruption and cover-ups," while economic adviser Peter Navarro said it proved "justice delayed is not justice denied."</p><p>Democrats condemned the charges as politically motivated. </p><p>Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) denounced what he called a "malicious prosecution," reminding reporters that Trump previously fired a prosecutor who refused to bring "frivolous charges."</p><p>Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, issued an even sharper rebuke. </p><p>"This kind of interference is a dangerous abuse of power," he warned. "By ousting a respected, independent prosecutor and replacing him with a partisan loyalist, Trump is undermining one of the most important U.S. Attorney’s offices in the country and eroding the rule of law itself."</p><p>Republican Rep. Don Bacon, of Nebraska — who announced earlier this year that he will not run for re-election in 2026 — used the term "Lawfare."</p><p>"Lawfare undermines our great country. It didn’t start in Jan, but it didn’t end either. The continued escalation will only hurt us all," the congressman said in a post on X. "Comey has his hands dirty in regards to Lawfare. But, in its totality, this is all bad for us," he opined in another post.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Alex Nitzberg contributed to this report</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Bill Maher believes this outsider could be the key to restore the Democratic Party's credibility with voters</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Talk show host Bill Maher argued on Thursday that the Democratic Party’s brand is so tarnished in the eyes of voters that it needs a total outsider like sports commentator Stephen A. Smith to redeem it.</p><p>During an interview on Smith’s "Straight Shooter" podcast, the host, who has flirted with running for the presidency, asked Maher, "Who’s the candidate on the left that can somehow derail [Trump]? Because I don’t see anybody with a national presence that can pull that off. Where are you on that?"</p><p>"I see somebody right here in my Zoom camera," Maher replied.</p><p>Smith denied that he would run, saying he is too careful about giving up his money, but Maher pressed his case, arguing the Democratic Party is a "ghost brand," like one of the major chain stores once ubiquitous in shopping malls that have struggled in recent times but still are remembered by the public. </p><p>Like these stores, Maher argued, it would take "an outsider" who has no sentimental attachment to the Democratic Party’s past who could redeem it.</p><p>"But it would have to be somebody who is unapologetic about calling them out. People have lost faith in the Democratic Party for very good reasons. And you’re the only one I hear who doesn’t look like he cares what the other Democrats will say about it," Maher said.</p><p>"I don’t care. I really don’t," Smith agreed. "I don’t give a damn what they say. I really don’t."</p><p>"I know," Maher agreed, "I don’t either. I’m right where you are. We’re very close on all these things. And I think somebody with that kind of abandon is the only person who is going to win back former Democratic voters who have switched over."</p><p>Maher also praised Newsom’s ability to move to the center on issues but warned he would have to do so "a lot more" to be viable and to separate his image from being associated with far-left policies in California. </p><p>"Do you think a far-lefty can win a national election in this day and age? A presidential election?" Smith asked before saying he didn't think so. </p><p>"I don't think so either," Maher agreed.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Bree Danyele Montoya, a city councilmember representing Norman, Oklahoma's Ward 3, resigned effective immediately Tuesday after a Facebook comment she wrote telling a Trump supporter to harm herself resurfaced and went viral when shared by Libs of TikTok.</p><p>The resignation followed months of inaction from the city council, critics say, until the exchange gained national traction online. The City of Norman has since emphasized that while elected officials speak for themselves, it "does not support actions or behaviors that may encourage harm."</p><p>"In various capacities, I have served this community since 2008, and I am ready to pursue other interests. Effective immediately, I am resigning as councilmember for Ward 3. Thank you, Ward 3," Montoya said at the meeting.</p><p>The recipient of Montoya’s comments, constituent Audra Abbott, told FOX affiliate KOKH she was shocked when she realized who had written them. </p><p>"I saw that she was a city council member within moments of her posting it, and I was like, ‘Wow, I can’t believe that an elected official would talk like that online,’" she said.</p><p>"If it hadn’t went viral with Libs of TikTok picking it up, I don’t think that anything would have happened at all."</p><p>Chaya Raichik, who runs Libs of TikTok, told Fox News Digital, "With a rising trend of violent left-wing extremists targeting conservatives, it is our duty to hold elected officials, such as Oklahoma City Councilor Bree Montoya, accountable for violent rhetoric, regardless of their status or position.</p><p>"While the fake news media refuses to acknowledge the truth of the rising epidemic of far-left violence, Libs of TikTok will continue to expose elected leaders who promote violence, demonize ICE, or issue threatening statements against the American people."</p><p>In an email to Fox News Digital, Norman Chief Communications Officer Tiffany Martinez Vrska said, "The City of Norman as a municipal corporation does not support actions or behaviors that may encourage harm; carrying out municipal functions that provide or support public service remains the focus of the corporation." She added that elected officials speak only for themselves when making personal remarks. Officials pointed to resources explaining Norman’s council–manager government structure and how the Ward 3 vacancy will be filled in the coming weeks.</p><p>The online clash dates back to June, when Montoya and Abbott argued on Facebook about the size of a "No Kings" protest. Montoya called Abbott "uneducated" and escalated by telling her to harm herself. </p><p>Screenshots of the exchange spread in local Facebook groups during the summer before Libs of TikTok recently amplified them on social media. Abbott and others say Norman officials ignored the controversy until the post gained traction online. Montoya was first elected in 2023, re-elected in February 2025, sworn in again July 1 and resigned less than three months later.</p><p>At the Sept. 23 meeting, Mayor Stephen Tyler Holman addressed the incident.</p><p>"As your mayor, I want to affirm our commitment to upholding the rights guaranteed under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The right to free speech is fundamental to our democracy, and it is our responsibility to ensure that every citizen has the opportunity to express their opinions and be heard," the mayor said.</p><p>"While we honor the right to free speech, we must also maintain an environment that is respectful, orderly and conducive to productive discussion," Holman added. "My goal is to ensure that every voice in this room can be heard while maintaining the integrity and decorum of our meetings. I ask for your cooperation and mutual respect as we continue to work together for the betterment of Norman."</p></body></div></body></html>

I will say those words now as I type: ‘I forgive the man who killed my father.’ Peace be with you all," Allen wrote.</p><p>Allen's father died in 1964 after a drunk driver's vehicle collided with his vehicle.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>For the first time since 1935 at Ridgewood Country Club in Paramus, New Jersey, the Ryder Cup will be played in the New York City metro area, as Team USA and Team Europe will spend the weekend at the famed Bethpage Black on Long Island.</p><p>It was announced that this year's Ryder Cup would take place at Bethpage Black, famously recommended "only for highly skilled golfers" on Sept. 17, 2013. Originally, this was supposed to be the 2024 Ryder Cup, but the pandemic postponed the 2020 Ryder Cup, pushing back each of the events that followed.</p><p>This was actually the second time the Ryder Cup had been delayed, the first being in 2001 due to the Sept. 11 terror attacks. So, the Ryder Cup, which originally was planned to take place in odd-numbered years, has reverted to its old ways. </p><p></p><p>Now, after nearly 12 years since the announcement, golfers will finally tee off shortly after 7 a.m. ET on Friday. NBC, USA and Peacock will be streaming the events.</p><p>The Ryder Cup began in 1927, originally as a competition between the United States and Great Britain and Ireland. But the Americans dominated, and Jack Nicklaus was part of expanding the overseas team to include all of Europe beginning in 1979, changing the tournament forever.</p><p>The change brought in legends like Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer and Sandy Lyle, and Europe became a legitimate force. Since the expansion, there have been 22 Ryder Cups, and Europe has a 12-9-1 record in that span. That includes the U.S. winning the first three Ryder Cups since the European expansion.</p><p>The biennial match-play tournament is a three-day event with five different sessions. Friday and Saturday see four fourball matches and four alternate-shot matches split between the morning and afternoon. On Sunday, all 24 players go one-on-one in singles matches.</p><p>A total of 28 points are up for grabs, so a team needs 14.5 points to win the Ryder Cup. However, since Team Europe won the last event, a tie would result in it retaining the trophy until 2027.</p><p>Team USA, captained by Keegan Bradley, consists of Scottie Scheffler, J.J. Spaun, Xander Schauffele, Russell Henley, Harris English, Bryson DeChambeau, Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, Cameron Young, Ben Griffin, Patrick Cantlay and Sam Burns. Bradley had the opportunity to select himself but ultimately chose not to.</p><p>Luke Donald is bringing back just about his entire winning team from 2023. The only difference is Rasmus Hojgaard taking the place of his twin brother, Nicolai. Hojgaard will join Rory McIlroy, Robert MacIntyre, Tommy Fleetwood, Justin Rose, Tyrrell Hatton, Shane Lowry, Sepp Straka, Ludvig Aberg, Viktor Hovland, Matt Fitzpatrick and Jon Rahm.</p><p>Team Europe has a chance to break a pair of streaks because no team has won back-to-back Ryder Cups since Europe won three straight from 2010 to 2014. That 2012 European team also remains the last to win a Ryder Cup on the road.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<p><em>This story is part of a collaboration with The Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina.</em></p><p>A federal health agency that has promised to scale back its animal research has drawn the attention of animal rights advocates who want to know why it quietly approved millions in new funding for dozens of primate experiments since President Trump took office.</p><p>"The NIH's rhetoric about reducing animal testing doesn't match reality," said Justin Goodman, senior vice president of White Coat Waste, an organization that has described the Trump Administration's commitment to drastically reduce animal testing as a "watershed moment" in its fight to end the practice.</p><p>His group is highlighting the new spending to add pressure on National Institutes of Health director Jay Bhattacharya, one of several federal officials who promised that the agency will stop funding all but the most essential animal research and implement alternative testing methods. That decision — highly controversial in the world of medical research — comes at a moment when animal rights advocates have unprecedented leverage within the U.S. government through their close alliances with the president and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p><p>NIH did not respond to requests for comment. In April, Bhattacharya said the initiative to steer projects to alternative tests "marks a critical leap forward for science, public trust, and patient care."</p>
<p>One of the new projects is a kidney transplant study that will use about 99 monkeys at a cost of about $10,000 each, bought from a South Carolina primate farm. That operation gained global attention last year when federally-owned <span class="link">research monkeys escaped</span> into a rural town.</p><p>Monkeys from Alpha Genesis will be used in new kidney research at the University of Pittsburgh that involves doing transplants in monkeys and euthanizing them at the study's conclusion. The project got $1.4 million in July from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The study is slated to receive $10.1 million through 2030, according to funding documents.</p><p>The university said in a statement its researchers are "grateful for the federal support and closely follow all regulations and industry standards, including continual evaluation of the suppliers of animal models that, at this time, remain necessary to our ability to achieve medical breakthroughs that save human lives. </p><p>White Coat Waste has catalogued about $91 million in spending on animal research in recent months and provided details of the kidney project funding.The group has used Freedom of Information Act requests and spending documents to compile a list of more than 70 projects receiving money through the National Institutes of Health, despite promises to cut back on the funding.</p>
<p>Animal rights groups have estimated that the federal government spends as much as $20 billion a year on research involving dogs, cats, monkeys and other animals. NIH is the biggest funder.</p><p>Some controversial animal projects were cut from the budget as the Department of Government Efficiency under Elon Musk focused on wasteful spending. A <span class="link">joint investigation by CBS News</span> and The Post and Courier found nearly $28 million in cancelled federal grants.</p><p>Animal rights groups and some scientists have questioned the scientific value of animal experiments, which are often inconclusive. But patients rely on drugs and medical procedures under development for new treatments.</p><p>Primates have been used for decades to test new medications and treatments before they move to clinical trials in humans.</p><p>Alpha Genesis has regularly supplied monkeys for studies that hope to one day improve human tolerance for transplanted organs. But it came under criticism last year after the dramatic monkey escape and a regulatory lapse that led to the deaths of 22 research monkeys from apparent carbon monoxide poisoning. Whistleblowers inside the monkey farm reported the fatalities to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights group, which alerted a federal animal protection agency. Greg Westergaard, the company president, did not respond to a message.</p><p>White Coat Waste also discovered in March that NIAID would continue funding for the operations of Morgan Island, a remote barrier island popularly known as "Monkey Island" where the federal agency keeps up to 4,000 rhesus monkeys destined for research.</p><p>U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, has called for a shutdown of the island, which is managed by Alpha Genesis, and recently inserted language into a House appropriations bill demanding that NIH explain its continued use.</p>

<p>Almost 200,000 BMWs, along with some Toyota Supras, are being recalled in the U.S. by the German automaker due to the potential for a short circuit in their starters that could increase the risk of a fire, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Friday.</p><p>A total of 196,355 vehicles in the U.S. will be subject to the recall, the vast majority of them BMWs made between 2019 and 2022, in which NHTSA said "the engine starter relay may corrode, causing the relay to overheat and short circuit," increasing the risk of a fire.</p><p>NHTSA said in its notice that BMW of North America was recalling certain 2019-2021 BMW 330i, 2019-2022 BMW Z4, 2020-2022 BMW 530i, X3, X4, Toyota Supra, 2021-2022 BMW 430i, 430i Convertible, and 2022 BMW 230i vehicles, and that letters would go out to owners from November 14 to inform them of the issue. </p><p>From that day, vehicle owners will also be able to search online at NHTSA.gov/recalls, ­­entering either their unique Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), or the year, make and model of their vehicle to confirm whether it is subject to the recall.</p><p>"Owners are advised to park their vehicles outside and away from structures until the remedy is complete" NHTSA said in its notice of the recall on Friday. "Dealers will replace the engine starter, free of charge."</p>
<p>The agency, part of the Department of Transportation, said owners could also contact BMW's U.S. customer service line directly at 1-800-525-7417 with questions. </p><p>The recall notice comes just over a year after <span class="link">BMW announced a recall</span> of more than 720,700 vehicles in North America because they were equipped with an electric water pump that could short circuit as a result of faulty installation, posing a fire hazard. </p>

<div class="article-title">Dr. Oz says "of course" pregnant women should take Tylenol if a doctor says so</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Dr. Mehmet Oz told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on "The Takeout" Thursday the Trump administration is not advising pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol under any circumstances — as President Trump's <span class="link">announcement this week</span> about an alleged link between the painkiller and fever reducer and autism draws pushback from medical experts.</p><p>Oz — a former surgeon and television personality who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an agency that is under the Department of Health and Human Services — said that if a pregnant woman develops a high fever, a doctor will likely encourage her to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, because <span class="link">fevers can pose health risks</span>.  And studies show acetaminophen is the safest medication to treat fevers in pregnant women. </p><p>"The concern here is that I believe most women get low-grade fevers, they stub their toe, they have little aches and pains, and they think it's perfectly safe to throw a couple paracetamol or acetaminophen or Tylenol when they're pregnant, and I don't think that's the case," Oz said.</p><p>On Monday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary released an open letter to physicians that said acetaminophen use during pregnancy "may be associated with" an increased risk of conditions like autism. </p><p>The letter noted that "while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established."</p>
<p>Makary's letter was also more tempered than Mr. Trump's comments during a news conference earlier this week in which the president said there's "no downside in not taking" Tylenol. </p><p>"Acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics," Makary wrote in his letter. </p><p>There is concern among the medical community that, as a result of the FDA's announcement Monday, that some patients could turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy. </p><p>"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication," Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News following the FDA's announcement. "The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism."</p>
<p>In a statement in response to the FDA's announcement, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said, "Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism," calling it "the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy." </p><p>Oz also addressed Makary's announcement that the agency will approve the prescription drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid, to treat autism in children. Specialists say <span class="link">leucovorin can be helpful</span> in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.</p><p>"The key question is, if you, as a researcher on those trials, had a child, would you give that child leucovorin?" Oz said he asked of researchers studying leucovorin. "And when I asked the doctors on those trials, they said yes."</p><p>Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is no scientific consensus as to why.</p><p>Oz said that when he, Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, were asked by the White House to examine the issue, they found two "clues," not conclusions, that pointed to leucovorin as a possible treatment option for autistic children, and acetaminophen as a medication pregnant women should be cautious about taking.  </p><p>"These are things that we believe, that if you're fully transparent about, you'll rebuild trust with the American people," Oz said. "Just tell people what you know." </p><p>Oz argued that Mr. Trump was right in pushing for the FDA to both approve leucovorin and make its Tylenol recommendation — even though there is no consensus in the medical community and no definitive evidence supporting either move — because he believes the FDA has an obligation to be transparent. </p>
<p>But Oz was clear that patients should consult their doctors first before making a decision. </p><p>"The Tylenol issue is whether or not we should warn moms, who are pregnant today, about a problem that we may not know fully the answer to — 'Is Tylenol a problem during pregnancy?'  — for another five years," Oz said. "Well, what about the kid today? Are you going to take the Tylenol or not. Well I think the answer is, the best prudent answer, of course take it if a doctor says you need it. But don't take it on your own without thinking twice about it." </p><p>Oz also indicated that he would not advise a pregnant family member to take Tylenol without talking to their physician first.   </p><p>"We're guarded in saying we don't have all the answers," he said. "But if it's my family, I'm not going to have my pregnant daughter take acetaminophen if she doesn't need to be on it without certainly talking to a doctor about it."</p>

<div class="article-title">A grand jury charged Comey with 2 counts — but rejected a third. Here's what they say.</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump's Justice Department <span class="link">charged former FBI Director James Comey</span> on Thursday with lying to Congress, an unprecedented step against a longtime Trump foe that revisits controversies over the FBI's Trump-Russia probe from nearly a decade ago.</p><p>A grand jury in Northern Virginia voted to indict Comey on two counts: making a false statement to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. In an unusual move, the grand jury voted against indicting him on an additional charge of making a false statement.</p><p>The criminal charges revolve around a Senate hearing in September 2020, when lawmakers grilled Comey — who was fired by Mr. Trump three years earlier — about how he handled the FBI's 2016 investigations into pro-Trump election meddling by Russia and Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Both election-year probes have drawn Mr. Trump's ire for years.</p><p>The five-year statute of limitations for charges out of that hearing would have expired next week.</p><p>Comey asserted in an Instagram video that he is innocent.</p>
<p>In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the indictment "reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people."</p><h2>Count 1: Comey accused of lying about media leaks</h2><p>The first count against Comey that was approved by the grand jury accuses him of breaking a federal law that makes it a crime to make "any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation" to a federal body, including Congress.</p><p>The charge hinges on a combative back-and-forth between the former FBI director and Republican Sen.Ted Cruz of Texas during the Sept. 30, 2020, Senate hearing.</p><p>In the hearing, Cruz pressed Comey on whether he had ever authorized another FBI staffer to serve as an anonymous source in any media reports about the bureau's 2016 investigations involving Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton. </p>
<p>Comey had answered no to a similar question during another Senate hearing in 2017. But Cruz said in the 2020 questioning that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe — another Trump foe — has "publicly and repeatedly stated that he leaked information to the Wall Street Journal and that you were directly aware of it and that you directly authorized it," referring to an article about an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.</p><p>"Now, what Mr. McCabe is saying and what you testified to this committee cannot both be true. One or the other is false," the senator said to Comey. "Who's telling the truth?"</p><p>"I can only speak to my testimony. I stand by the testimony," replied Comey.</p><p>Thursday's indictment alleges that this statement is false because Comey "then and there knew, he in fact had authorized [an unnamed person] to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding an FBI investigation."</p><p>A 2018 report by the Justice Department inspector general's office says Comey and McCabe discussed the Wall Street Journal article after it came out, but gave investigators competing stories about their meeting. Comey told the watchdog that McCabe "led him to believe" that McCabe hadn't authorized the release of any information to the Journal. But McCabe said he told Comey a day after the article was published that he'd approved the release himself, and Comey replied that it was a good idea.</p><p>The report says "the overwhelming weight of that evidence supported Comey's version of the conversation," and McCabe "lacked candor" in his conversation with Comey.</p><p>McCabe later told "<span class="link">60 Minutes</span>" he did not intentionally mislead the inspector general.</p>
<p>McCabe was fired in 2018, <span class="link">days before</span> he was set to retire.</p><h2>Count 2: Obstructing a congressional proceeding</h2><p>Comey was also indicted Thursday for allegedly trying to "influence, obstruct and impede" an investigation by the Senate Judiciary Committee by "making false and misleading statements." The indictment does not say what alleged false statement led to the obstruction charge.</p><h2>Grand jury rejects a charge against Comey</h2><p>A majority of the Alexandria, Virginia-based grand jury that reviewed the Comey matter voted not to charge him with one of the three counts presented by prosecutors, according to a form that was signed by the grand jury's foreperson and filed in court Thursday.</p><p>In order for federal prosecutors to criminally indict somebody, they need to convince most members of a 23-person grand jury that they have "probable cause" to believe a crime was committed — a much lower bar than the one needed to convict somebody.</p><p>It's very rare for grand juries to decline an indictment. In the 2016 fiscal year, federal prosecutors declined to bring charges against somebody because the grand jury didn't return an indictment only six times, out of more than 150,000 suspects who were investigated that year, according to a Justice Department report.</p><p>In recent months, however, grand juries in Washington, D.C., have rejected several requests for indictments by the Justice Department, including a possible felony charge against a person who was <span class="link">accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal agent</span>. Former federal prosecutor Brendan Ballou <span class="link">told CBS News</span> earlier this month that trend "suggests that the administration has absolutely destroyed its credibility with jurors."</p><p>The unsuccessful count against Comey would have accused him of illegally making false statements to Congress during a line of questioning by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in September 2020.</p>
<p>Graham had asked Comey if he remembered getting a lead from the intelligence community in September 2016 that alleged Hillary Clinton's campaign "was going to create a scandal regarding Trump and Russia" in order to distract from her use of a private email server. </p><p>Comey replied: "That doesn't ring a bell" — which the Justice Department called false.</p><p>The allegation about Clinton's campaign first surfaced in 2020, when it was declassified by Mr. Trump's Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe. Clinton campaign officials denied the accusation to Justice Department special counsel John Durham, a Trump-era prosecutor tasked with reviewing the Russia probe. But Durham said in a 2023 report that FBI investigators looking into possible Trump-Russia ties should've paid more attention to the claims.</p>

<div class="article-title">Former FBI Director James Comey indicted on 2 counts</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington</em> — Former FBI Director James Comey was indicted Thursday on two counts, marking a major escalation in President Trump's efforts to target his political opponents and use the Justice Department as part of his campaign to seek retribution against his most ardent critics.</p><p>Comey was charged with one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice, related to Senate testimony he gave almost five years ago. A majority of grand jurors did not approve indicting him on an additional count of lying to Congress, according to court papers — an unusual development since grand juries rarely reject charges.</p><p>In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi alleged that Comey "obstructed a congressional investigation into the disclosure of sensitive information" and made a false statement to Congress. </p><p>"Comey stated that he did not authorize someone at the FBI to be an anonymous source. According to the indictment that statement was false," Bondi's statement read.</p><p>"No one is above the law," Bondi wrote on X. "Today's indictment reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case."</p>
<p>Mr. Trump celebrated the indictment in a Truth Social post, calling the former FBI director — whom he fired in 2017 — "One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to."</p><p>Comey asserted his innocence in a video on Instagram and said, "there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump."</p><p>"My heart is broken for the Department of Justice, but I have great confidence in the federal judicial system. And I'm innocent. So let's have a trial. And keep the faith," he said.</p><p>Comey's attorney, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, said in a statement: "Jim Comey denies the charges filed today in their entirety. We look forward to vindicating him in the courtroom."</p>
<p>Comey is set to be arraigned on the morning of Oct. 9 in Alexandria, Virginia. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Michael S. Nachmanoff, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden.</p><h2>Comey charges focus on testimony to Congress</h2><p>The indictment was returned in the Eastern District of Virginia as the clock ticked down on the five-year statute of limitations for charges arising out of his September 2020 testimony to Congress, which was set to expire Tuesday, Sept. 30. </p><p>Comey <span class="link">appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee</span> in 2020 to answer questions about the origins of the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, known as "Crossfire Hurricane." The probe, which has frustrated Mr. Trump for years, was later taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller.</p><p>During that hearing, GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas asked Comey about earlier testimony in 2017 denying having been an anonymous source or authorizing another FBI official to be an anonymous source for news reports about the FBI's investigations into Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton. The probe involving Clinton examined her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state.</p><p>Comey told Cruz in 2020 that he stood by his earlier testimony. </p><p>But a lawyer for Andrew McCabe, Comey's former deputy, said in 2018 that McCabe authorized the disclosure of information to a Wall Street Journal reporter in 2016 about the Clinton investigation with Comey's knowledge. The lawyer made the claim in response to an <span class="link">investigation by the Justice Department's internal watchdog</span>, which found McCabe "lacked candor" when he told Comey, or led Comey to believe, that he had not authorized the disclosure.</p><p>Thursday's indictment called Comey's statement that he hadn't authorized anybody to serve as an anonymous source "materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent."</p>
<p>Comey testified before Congress from his home in McLean, Virginia, which is why the former FBI director was investigated in the state's eastern judicial district.</p><p>The charges come just days after the president <span class="link">tapped his former defense lawyer</span> and White House aide, Lindsey Halligan, to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. Halligan, who has no prosecutorial experience, took over as interim U.S. attorney following the <span class="link">abrupt departure</span> of Erik Siebert amid apparent pressure from the president and his allies to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p><p>The Comey indictment is signed only by Halligan, and no other rank-and-file prosecutors' names appear on the charging documents.</p><p>Halligan said in a press release, "The charges as alleged in this case represent a breach of the public trust at an extraordinary level."</p><p>Siebert informed staff on Friday, Sept. 19, that he had resigned, an announcement that came after multiple sources told CBS News that prosecutors in his office were concerned Siebert could be removed for failing to prosecute James for alleged mortgage fraud. James has denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Trump has <span class="link">said he fired Siebert</span>.</p><p>The president publicly voiced frustration to Attorney General Pam Bondi for the lack of action against Comey, James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California, another political opponent, and warned on social media it was "killing our reputation and credibility." </p><p>"They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!" Mr. Trump wrote on the social media platform Truth Social, referring to the federal and state criminal cases brought against him.</p>
<p>He announced Halligan as his pick to lead the Eastern District of Virginia shortly after, writing she is "fair, smart and will provide desperately needed, JUSTICE FOR ALL!" </p><p>Comey and Mr. Trump have sparred for years. Comey served as FBI director from 2013 until <span class="link">he was fired</span> by Mr. Trump in 2017, during the president's first White House term.</p><p>That firing ultimately set into motion <span class="link">Mueller's special counsel investigation</span> into allegations that <span class="link">Russia interfered</span> in the 2016 presidential election and that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced those allegations as a "hoax."</p><p>For his part, Comey has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump since his firing, calling him "morally unfit" to be president <span class="link">in a 2018 interview</span>.</p><p>Earlier this year, Comey <span class="link">provoked an outcry</span> from the Trump administration after he briefly posted a photo on social media that administration officials alleged was a call for violence against Mr. Trump. As a result, Secret Service agents interviewed Comey for about an hour and a half. </p><p>In an interview, Mr. Trump said it was "loud and clear" that Comey was calling for his assassination, telling Fox News that any charges for the post should be left to Bondi. Comey denied advocating violence.</p><p>Since returning to the White House for a second term, the president has been engaged in wide-ranging efforts to go after his political opponents and has used different levers of the federal government to do so. His administration <span class="link">revoked security clearances</span> from former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, <span class="link">among others</span>. He also <span class="link">directed that security clearances</span> of 37 current and former national security officials be rescinded.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump also <span class="link">ended Secret Service protection</span> for Harris, former national security adviser <span class="link">John Bolton</span>, and Biden's two children, <span class="link">Hunter and Ashley Biden</span>.</p>

<p>Tropical Storm Humberto formed Wednesday in the central tropical Atlantic, and it is expected to move northwest over the next several days, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is one of two systems swirling over the western Atlantic that could potentially bring some downstream impacts to parts of the Southeast U.S. coast, from Florida up to North Carolina, the director of the Miami-based hurricane center, Michael Brennan, said.</p><p>Currently, there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect. </p><h2>Tropical Storm Humberto forecast and path</h2><p>As of Thursday evening, Humberto was located about 470 miles northeast of the northern Leeward Islands. It was moving northwest at about 6 mph with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph.</p><p>"Significant strengthening is forecast, and Humberto is expected to become a hurricane on Friday and a major hurricane this weekend," the hurricane center said on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles from the center of Humberto.</p>
<p>It is the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. The tropical storm comes on the heels of <span class="link">Hurricane Gabrielle</span>, which is not impacting land and is forecast to head farther out into the Atlantic.</p><h2>Another storm system brews over the Caribbean</h2><p>The hurricane center said it is also closely monitoring a second storm system over the northeast Caribbean in the Atlantic near Humberto.</p>
<p>The system is likely to become a tropical depression late this week, forecasters said.</p><p>It is likely to bring heavy rains near Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic through Wednesday before strengthening near the Bahamas, according to the NHC.</p>

<div class="article-title">Alabama man convicted of killing store clerk in 1997 is executed by nitrogen gas</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>An Alabama man convicted of killing a woman during a 1997 gas station robbery was put to death Thursday after apologizing to his victim's family and pleas from the woman's son to spare his life. </p><p>Geoffrey Todd West, 50, was executed at William C. Holman Correctional Facility by <span class="link">nitrogen gas</span>, a method <span class="link">Alabama began using last year</span>. It was one of two executions of the night in the country, as <span class="link">Texas put to death</span> a man convicted of killing his girlfriend's 13-month-old daughter.  </p><p>West was convicted of capital murder in the 1997 killing of Margaret Parrish Berry, 33. </p><p>West said "No sir" when asked by the warden if he had final words. Strapped to the gurney with a blue-rimmed gas mask covering his face, he gave a thumbs-up in the direction of his attorney as the execution began at about 5:56 p.m. </p><p>West's eyes were open as he appeared to gulp and struggle for breath during the first two minutes. His head rocked from side to side, his left fist curled up, and he appeared to slightly foam at the mouth. At about 6:01, he began to take a long series of breaths with long pauses in between before becoming still at about 6:07. He was pronounced dead at 6:22. </p>
<p>In a final statement provided by his attorney, West said: "I have apologized privately to the family of Margaret Parrish Berry, and am humbled by the forgiveness her son, Will, has extended."</p><p>He added that he was baptized in the Catholic Church this year and was "at peace because I know where I am going." </p><p>Berry, the mother of two sons, was shot in the back of the head while lying on the floor behind the counter at Harold's Chevron in Etowah County on March 28, 1997.</p><p>Prosecutors said she was killed execution-style to ensure there was no witness. Court records state that $250 was taken from a cookie can that held the station's money. A jury voted 10-2 to recommend a death sentence.</p>
<p>West, in an interview last week, did not deny killing Margaret Berry. He said that at age 50, he struggles to understand what he did as a young man. He and his girlfriend were desperate for cash and went to the station, where he once worked, to rob it.</p><p>"There's not a day that goes by that I don't regret it and wish that I could take that back," West told AP by telephone. He said he wanted Berry's family to know he regrets what happened. </p><p>Will Berry urged Alabama's governor to commute West's sentence to life in prison. He said taking another life will not help his family. He exchanged letters with West ahead of the execution. </p><p>"I forgive him and so does my dad. We don't want him to die," Will Berry said. </p><p>He was 11 when his mother was killed, and he said prosecutors urged the family to support a death sentence. Now a father and grandfather, Will Berry said time and faith have given him a different perspective. </p><p>Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said in a Sept. 11 letter to Berry that she intended to let the execution go forward. She wrote that she appreciates his belief but said it is her duty to uphold Alabama law.</p><p>"Almost 30 years ago, Margaret Parrish Berry went to work at the convenience store, but she would never get to return home. Geoffrey West went in with the intent to rob and kill, and he cowardly shot Ms. Berry in the back of the head," Ivey said in a statement issued after the execution. </p>
<p>"Tonight, the lawfully imposed death sentence has been carried out, justice has been served, and I pray for healing for all," the governor added. </p><p>Also in a statement Thursday, Will Berry expressed astonishment at the execution and offered condolences to West's loved ones. </p><p>"From what we understand, he acted out of character that night. People he grew up with said he was a good person who got off track," Berry said. "We pray that he gains peace when he meets his maker."</p><p>Berry and West asked to meet ahead of the execution, but the Alabama Department of Corrections denied the request, citing security regulations.</p><p>The Federal Defenders Office of the Middle District, which represented West, said in a statement that denying the meeting was a "lost opportunity — for closure, for healing, for humanity."</p><p>"The execution of Mr. West demands that we reflect as a society: on how we handle capital punishment, on how age and life circumstances are considered, on how we balance justice, mercy, and the possibility of redemption," his attorneys said in a statement. </p><p>The execution method used to put West to death involved strapping a gas mask to his face and forcing him to breathe pure nitrogen gas, depriving him of the oxygen needed to stay alive. </p>
<p>Asked about West's movements during the execution. Corrections Commissioner John Hamm said he believes they were largely involuntary and things went "just as expected, according to protocol." </p><p>Alabama became the first state to carry out a nitrogen gas execution in 2024. Nationally, the method has now been used in seven executions: six times in Alabama and once in Louisiana. </p>

<div class="article-title">$1.5 billion settlement approved over Anthropic's alleged use of pirated books</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A federal judge on Thursday <span class="link">approved a $1.5 billion settlement</span> between artificial intelligence company Anthropic and authors who allege nearly half a million books had been illegally pirated to train chatbots.</p><p>U.S. District Judge William Alsup issued the preliminary approval in San Francisco federal court Thursday after the two sides worked to address his concerns about the settlement, which will pay authors and publishers about $3,000 for each of the books covered by the agreement. It does not apply to future works.</p><p>"This is a fair settlement," Alsup said, though he added that distributing it to all parties will be "complicated." About 465,000 books are on the list of works pirated by Anthropic, according to Justin Nelson, an attorney for the authors.</p><p>"We have some of the best lawyers in America in this courtroom and if anyone can do it, you can," Alsup said.</p><p>The Association of American Publishers called the settlement a "major step in the right direction in holding AI developers accountable for reckless and unabashed infringement."</p>
<p>"Anthropic is hardly a special case when it comes to infringement. Every other major AI developer has trained their models on the backs of authors and publishers, and many have sourced those works from the most notorious infringing sites in the world," said Maria A. Pallante, president and CEO of the publisher group.</p><p>San Francisco-based Anthropic said it is pleased with the preliminary approval.</p><p>"The decision will allow us to focus on developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems. As we've consistently maintained, the court's landmark June ruling that AI training constitutes transformative fair use remains intact. This settlement simply resolves narrow claims about how certain materials were obtained," said Aparna Sridhar, deputy general counsel at Anthropic.</p><p>The Authors Guild, meanwhile, said the settlement "marks a milestone in authors' fights against AI companies' theft of their works. It sends a clear signal to AI companies that infringement of authors' rights comes at a steep price and will undoubtedly push AI companies towards acquiring the books they want legally, through licensing."</p>
<p>A Monday filing sought to convince the judge that the parties have set up a system designed to get out robust notice to all authors and publishers covered by the agreement, ensuring they get their cut of the pot if they want to sign off on the settlement or opt out to protect their legal rights moving forward.</p><p>They also tried to assure him that the author and publishers group that cobbled the deal together are not doing any "back room" dealings that would hurt lesser-known authors.</p><p>Alsup's main concern centered on how the claims process will be handled in an effort to ensure everyone eligible knows about it so the authors don't "get the shaft." He had set a Sept. 22 deadline for submitting a claims form for him to review before Thursday's hearing to review the settlement again.</p><p>The judge had raised worries about two big groups connected to the case — the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers — working "behind the scenes" in ways that could pressure some authors to accept the settlement without fully understanding it.</p><p>Attorneys for the authors said in Monday's filing they believe the settlement will result in a high claims rate, respects existing contracts and is "consistent with due process" and the court's guidance.</p><p>Alsup had <span class="link">dealt the case a mixed ruling in June</span>, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn't illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites to help improve its Claude chatbot.</p><p>Bestselling thriller novelist Andrea Bartz, who sued Anthropic with two other authors last year, said in a court declaration ahead of the hearing that she strongly supports the settlement and will work to explain its significance to fellow writers.</p>
<p>"Together, authors and publishers are sending a message to AI companies: You are not above the law, and our intellectual property isn't yours for the taking," she wrote.</p><p>Alsup also said in the courtroom Thursday that he plans to step down from the bench by the end of the year. President Bill Clinton nominated him for the federal bench in 1999.</p>

<div class="article-title">California bill sparked by waking baby could silence streaming ads nationwide</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Believe it or not, an 8-month-old's sleep schedule is leading to a face-off between California lawmakers and the entertainment industry over loud commercials on streaming services.</p><p>California Senate Bill 576, introduced by state Senator Tom Umberg, would keep Netflix, Prime Video, and other streamers from blasting commercial volume way above the level of whatever show or movie you're watching.</p><p>Federal law already prohibits regular TV broadcasters from running commercials that are way louder than the program you're watching. However, streaming services weren't around when they passed the federal Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act back in 2010. So it doesn't apply to them.</p><p>Umberg's bill is trying to change that. The bill demonstrates the power of the California lawmakers to do something the federal government can't.</p><p>In a state this big, companies generally don't create one policy or product for California and another for everyone else. So as goes California, goes the nation.</p>
<h2>Don't wake the baby!</h2><p>Little Samantha is accomplished beyond her years — well, months — and may be the youngest lobbyist in California history, even if she is more interested in chewing on her legislation than reading it.</p><p>Her parents, Zach and Rachel Keller, were doing what new parents do: settling in to watch TV after finally getting Samantha down for the night.</p><p>That is when a blaring commercial abruptly ended their moment of peace, waking Samantha again. </p><p>"A lot of times, we have the volume so low that we just have subtitles running and still, the commercial ad volumes are so ear-piercing that it wakes her up," Rachel Keller said.</p>
<p>They're not the only ones who are frustrated. Forum and forum, and review after review, people across the country are complaining about loud streaming commercials and ads.</p><p>Samantha's parents thought it was time to close that streaming loophole in the federal CALM Act. Zach Keller works for Senator Umberg.</p><p>"I thought, 'I've got three kids, eight grandchildren. That's a good idea,' Umberg told CBS News California. "I think it's one of the most popular bills in the legislature, but it's not popular with everyone."</p><p>The bill was unanimously passed by the state Senate and sailed through its Assembly committee. But it stalled before its final vote as the powerful Motion Picture Association fought hard to kill the bill, arguing it could hurt small independent streaming services.</p><p>Unlike the broadcasting cable networks, streaming ads come from several different sources and cannot necessarily or practically be controlled by streaming platforms.</p><p>"'Are you kidding?' That's my response [to that]. They know which hand I use to basically control the remote. They can basically figure out how to make them within a normal range," Umberg said.</p><p>None of the streaming services responded to our emails, and the Motion Picture Association declined an interview.</p>
<p>As for Samantha and her very tired parents, they hope this bill ultimately helps babies across the country sleep a little more soundly.</p><p>The bill is now on Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk. The question is: Will he sign it?</p><p>If signed by Newsom, the commercial volume restrictions for streaming services would go into effect on July 1, 2026.</p><p>Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings just donated $2 million to the governor's congressional redistricting ballot measure campaign. Newsom's office told us it "does not typically comment on pending legislation."</p>

<div class="article-title">Texas man executed for fatally beating 13-month-old girl during "exorcism"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A Texas man was executed Thursday for killing his girlfriend's 13-month-old daughter in a torturous ordeal the couple said was part of an "exorcism" to expel a demon from the child's body.</p><p>Blaine Milam, 35, was pronounced dead at 6:40 p.m. following a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville. He was condemned for the December 2008 <span class="link">murder of Amora Carson</span> at his trailer in Rusk County in East Texas.</p><p>In a final statement, Milam thanked supporters as well as the prison chaplaincy for opening its faith-based programs to death row inmates.</p><p>"If any of you would like to see me again, I implore all of you no matter who you are to accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and we will meet again," he said from the death chamber gurney. "I love you all. Bring me home, Jesus."</p><p>As the lethal dose of sedative pentobarbital began flowing into his right hand and left arm, at 6:19 p.m. CDT, Milam grunted and gasped once, then began snoring quietly. After about two minutes, all sounds and movement stopped. Minutes later, he was declared dead.</p>
<p>It was one of two executions carried out Thursday evening in the U.S. Geoffrey West was put to death in Alabama with nitrogen gas for fatally shooting a gas station employee during a 1997 robbery. The two executions brought the year's total to 33 death sentences carried out nationwide.</p><p>Milam had blamed his then-girlfriend, Jesseca Carson, for the killing and alleged she was the one who claimed the girl was possessed by a demon. She was tried separately from Milam and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole after being convicted of capital murder for helping Milam. Both were 18 at the time.</p><p>Prosecutors said Milam savagely beat the girl and also bit, strangled, and mutilated her over a period of 30 hours. Court documents show a pipe wrench was among the evidence that tied Milam to the slaying.</p><p>A forensic pathologist who performed an autopsy found the child had multiple skull fractures along with broken arms, legs, ribs, and numerous bite marks. The pathologist testified at trial that he could not determine a specific cause of death because the girl had so many potentially fatal injuries.</p>
<p>Rusk County District Attorney Michael Jimerson, who tried the case along with the Texas Attorney General's Office, told The Associated Press in 2019 that authorities initially treated Milam and Carson as grieving parents.</p><p>But Carson later told investigators Milam told her Amora was "possessed by a demon" because "God was tired of her lying to Milam," according to court records.</p><p>Jimerson said at the time he still couldn't pinpoint a motive, believing the exorcism claim was just a way for Milam and Carson to cover up their crime.</p><p>The prosecutor witnessed the execution.</p><p>"We will never know what Amora would have contributed to our world," Jimerson said Thursday evening after it was over. "Answering the call for justice for the most helpless is a measure of a civilized people."</p><p>Among other observers was the child's grandfather, Richard Mutina. He declined to speak with reporters after the execution.</p><p>Milam was the fifth person put to death this year in Texas, historically the nation's busiest capital punishment state. Florida leads the nation this year with a record 12 executions conducted to date in 2025, with two more scheduled in the state by mid-October.</p>
<p>The execution was carried out hours after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Milam's final appeals.</p><p>Rebuffed previously by state and federal appeals courts, Milam's attorneys had asked the Supreme Court to block the execution, arguing his conviction was based in part on "now-discredited" bite mark evidence and other unreliable DNA evidence. They also argued he was intellectually disabled and thus ineligible for execution.</p><p>The Texas Attorney General's Office has said Milam's claims of an intellectual disability had been rejected previously by the courts. The attorney general's office also said in court documents that even if bitemark and DNA evidence were excluded, there was other evidence pointing to his guilt, including his efforts to hide evidence and a confession he made to a nurse after his arrest.</p><p>The use of bite mark evidence has been called into question in recent years, with a 2016 report by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology saying bitemark analysis "is clearly scientifically unreliable at present."</p><p>On Tuesday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles denied Milam's request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty. Milam previously had execution dates in 2019 and 2021 <span class="link">that were stayed</span>.</p>

Gavin Newsom done well, and what could be done differently?</p><p>CBS News California Investigates correspondent Julie Watts asked each of the candidates running for California governor.</p><p>For this series, Watts interviewed 11 gubernatorial candidates, pressing them on more than a dozen issues that matter to voters.</p><p>Read on to see what each candidate thinks Newsom has done right and to learn what they'd do differently.</p><h2>  Toni Atkins  </h2>
<p>Former California State Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins is one of the high-profile Democrats running to replace Gov. Newsom when he terms out in 2026. The San Diego resident praised Newsom's effort to go "toe-to-toe" with the Trump administration and Texas by redrawing California's congressional districts. Atkins also said that, if elected, one of her biggest priorities would be addressing health care. Watch Atkins' response here.</p>

<p>California's Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said he is running for governor because "California is at a critical inflection point" that could lead to prosperity or further decline. Thurmond, a Democrat, lauded Gov. Newsom for being a creative thinker and for his investments in public education. Thurmond said, if elected, he would work to improve California's insurance crisis and create more affordable housing. Watch Thurmond's response here.</p><h2>  Antonio Villaraigosa  </h2>
<p>Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat, said he is running for California governor to give the state a leader who is "a proven problem solver."

<div class="article-title">Humberto could mingle with another storm to create rare Fujiwhara effect</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><span class="link">Tropical Storm Humberto</span>, the eighth named storm to emerge this hurricane season, is currently swirling over waters just north of the Caribbean. Although forecasts as of Thursday predict that Humberto won't ever touch land, there is a possibility it could interact with another system developing nearby in the western Atlantic. </p><p>That's an unlikely outcome, said CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan. But if such a collision does occur, it could produce what's called <span class="link">the Fujiwhara effect</span>, a rare phenomenon in which two different storms merge and become entangled around a newly formed, common center. </p><p>How the process plays out depends on the characteristics of the storms involved, according to the National Weather Service. The forecasting agency describes the Fujiwhara effect on its website as "an intense dance" between two tropical storms that can happen when they get close enough to each other on their respective tracks to reach a common point and either join together or spin around each other for a period of time before continuing along their individual paths.  </p>
<p>In the latter scenario, the storms involved must be comparably strong or large.</p><p>"Typically when one system is stronger than the other, the smaller and weaker system will get overrun by the larger, stronger one and completely eliminate it," Nolan said. </p><p>Similar systems "will dance around each other" before going their separate ways, she continued, adding: "Very rarely has a larger system absorbed a smaller one and become larger or stronger, but it is scientifically possible."</p>
<p>Humberto grew into a tropical storm Wednesday night while traveling over open waters in the central tropical Atlantic. Forecasters expect it to move northwest over the next few days and strengthen along the way, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. It's one of two systems in the region that could potentially impact parts of the southeastern United States, including coastal areas from Florida to North Carolina, according to Michael Brennan, director of the hurricane center.</p><p>Officials at the center said Wednesday that they were monitoring a second storm churning near Humberto over the northeastern Caribbean, which would likely become a tropical depression later in the week and a tropical storm, named Imelda, over the weekend. That system is expected to strengthen as it tracks toward the Bahamas — driving up the chances of storm surge, wind and rainfall striking coastal parts of the southeastern U.S.</p><p>"With the two tropical troubles currently north of the Caribbean, these two may interact under the Fujiwhara effect in the days ahead," said Nolan. However, because the developing system "appears to be much weaker than Humberto and several miles away from it," an interaction between the two — if one even takes place at all — may not result in a tangled gravitational "dance." </p><p>In the event Humberto and the second system do collide, it's possible the paths they're expected to travel will change, Nolan added, but only slightly.</p>
<p>The National Hurricane Center said in an advisory Thursday morning that Humberto was on its way toward becoming a hurricane within a day or so over the central Atlantic. At the time, the storm was located about 465 miles east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands and had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would impose a new round of tariffs, including a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30% tariff on heavy trucks. </p><p>In social media posts to Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the new tariffs would take effect Oct. 1. </p><p>Mr. Trump said in his posts that the 100% tariff on "any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product" would not apply to companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., which he defined as either "breaking ground" or being "under construction."</p><p>In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shockwaves to voters <span class="link">as health care expenses</span>, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.</p><p>Trump argued that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were "flooding" the U.S. with their products and that tariffs must be applied "for National Security and other reasons." </p>
<p>The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people <span class="link">seeking to buy a house</span> feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.</p><p>Last month, Mr. Trump announced on social media that a "major Tariff Investigation" was being conducted on furniture coming into the U.S. and said that within the next 50 days, the investigation would be completed, and a tariff rate would be announced. </p><p>The president said the 25% tariff on "all 'Heavy (Big!) Trucks' made in other parts of the world" was "in order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition." </p><p>"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions," Trump posted.</p>
<p>Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration's broad tariffs defied predictions that they would fuel inflation, but that respite seems to have ended after <span class="link">economic data this month showed</span> the duties are now driving prices upward. The Consumer Price Index in <span class="link">August rose at a rate of 2.9%</span> from a year ago, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Mr. Trump <span class="link">first launched a sweeping set</span> of import taxes.</p><p>Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.</p><p>"There's no inflation," Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday. "We're having unbelievable success."</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington — </em>Democratic leaders in Congress on Thursday dismissed the White House's recent threat that a government shutdown could spur large-scale layoffs of the federal workforce as "intimidation," standing firm in their position ahead of the Oct. 1 funding deadline.</p><p>The White House's Office of Management and Budget <span class="link">sent a memo</span> to federal agencies on Wednesday telling them to consider reduction-in-force notices, or layoffs, for employees in programs, projects or activities that received discretionary funding. The RIF notices would come in addition to any furlough notices directing federal workers to stay home from work without pay if Congress fails to extend government funding by the deadline. </p><p>Democrats in Congress framed the move as an intimidation tactic by the White House and OMB Director Russ Vought, and said they intend to barrel ahead with their push to secure wins on key health care priorities in exchange for keeping the government funded. </p><p>"We will not be intimidated by Russ Vought, who's completely and totally out of control," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said at a news conference on Thursday. </p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer shared a similar sentiment in a statement on Wednesday, calling the memo "an attempt at intimidation."</p>
<p>"Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one — not to govern, but to scare," Schumer said. "This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government."</p><p>Democrats have repeatedly pushed for negotiations in the funding fight, looking to extract a more favorable outcome using one of their only points of leverage with Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Earlier this month, Democrats introduced a counteroffer to a GOP-led bill to keep the government funded that would also extend expiring health insurance subsidies. </p><p>The House approved a Republican measure to extend funding for seven weeks. Both the GOP bill and the Democrats' proposal fell short in the Senate, leading to the current stalemate.</p><p>After the House approved its bill, GOP leaders extended the lower chamber's break past the Oct. 1 deadline to fund the government, putting pressure on the Senate to approve their proposal. But Jeffries said on Thursday that the House-passed continuing resolution is "dead on arrival" in the Senate. He said it's "unclear" to him why House Republicans have left D.C. and have "decided they don't even want to have a conversation with Democrats to reach a bipartisan agreement."</p>
<p>"Republicans control the House, the Senate and the presidency," Jeffries said. "If the government shuts down, it's because they want the government to shut down."</p><p>Jeffries and Schumer had also pushed for a meeting with President Trump earlier this week. But Mr. Trump <span class="link">canceled</span> the meeting, citing the Democrats' demands, saying "no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive."</p><p>On Thursday, Jeffries said "the Democratic position is clear: we will meet and sit down anytime, any place with anyone, including the president, who canceled the meeting because the Republicans have determined that they want to shut down the government and hurt the American people."</p>

<div class="article-title">White House tells agencies to prepare for layoffs if government shuts down</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington </em>— The White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies Wednesday night telling them to prepare layoff plans if there is a government shutdown, increasing the stakes <span class="link">ahead of Congress' Tuesday deadline</span> to pass a government funding bill. </p><p>The news was first reported by Politico.</p><p>The memo, obtained by CBS News, tells agencies to consider reduction-in-force notices — a federal term for layoffs — for employees in programs, projects or activities that have discretionary funding that stops on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. It also goes further and says that employees should get RIF notices if they're in programs or projects "not consistent with the President's priorities." </p><p>The RIF notices would be in addition to any furlough notices directing federal workers to stay home from work without pay if there is a shutdown, the memo states. </p><p>"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government," the memo states. </p>
<p>An OMB official said that several programs will continue regardless of a shutdown, including Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits, military operations, law enforcement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and air traffic control. These are statutory federal programs and would not be impacted by any potential reductions-in-force.</p><p>"We remain hopeful that Democrats in Congress will not trigger a shutdown and the steps outlined above will not be necessary. The President supports enactment of a clean CR to ensure no discretionary spending lapse after September 30, 2025, and OMB hopes the Democrats will agree," the memo ends with.  </p><p>During the last few major government shutdowns, the executive branch has temporarily furloughed staff who are deemed non-essential and asked people in critical jobs to keep working without pay. After the shutdown ends, federal workers are normally paid back for their missed paychecks. It's far less common for the government to consider permanent layoffs.</p><p>Bobby Kogan, a former OMB official during the Biden administration, said the mass firings would be "an action of enormous self-harm inflicted on the nation, needlessly ridding the country of talent and expertise." </p>
<p>"It's also extortive. 'Give us what we want in a funding fight, or we'll hurt the country,'" Kogan said in a statement. </p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called the memo "an attempt at intimidation."</p><p>"Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one — not to govern, but to scare. This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government," he wrote, predicting that any laid-off workers will be hired back.</p><p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, also a New York Democrat, wrote on X: "We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings. Get lost."</p><p>The current fiscal year ends on Tuesday, Sept. 30, meaning the government will enter a shutdown Wednesday if Congress doesn't pass a new funding package.</p><p>A Republican short-term funding bill that <span class="link">passed the House</span> has failed to reach the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate. With a 53-seat Senate majority, Republicans need to earn the support of at least seven Democrats to resolve the funding dispute. Meanwhile, Democrats are <span class="link">asking for several concessions</span>, including a rollback of this year's Medicaid cuts and an extension to health insurance tax credits, in exchange for their votes.</p><p>On Tuesday, President Trump canceled a meeting with Democratic congressional leaders to negotiate on a short-term funding patch, saying that their demands were "unserious and ridiculous." </p>
<p>"I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive," he wrote on Truth Social.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump says he won't let Israel annex the West Bank</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump said Thursday he will not let Israel annex the occupied West Bank, an idea that has circulated among members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.</p><p>"I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank," the president told reporters during an Oval Office event. "There's been enough. It's time to stop now."</p><p>The president's comments come after several media outlets reported that Mr. Trump privately assured the leaders of Arab and majority-Muslim states this week that he would push back against any Israeli effort to annex the occupied territory.</p><p>In recent days, several Western countries — including <span class="link">France</span>, the United Kingdom and Canada — have moved to recognize a Palestinian state, leading Netanyahu to pledge some kind of response. Some hardline members of Netanyahu's governing coalition have pressed the Israeli government to react by annexing much of the West Bank, though it's unclear whether Netanyahu will seek to take that step.</p><p>Netanyahu did not immediately publicly respond to Mr. Trump's comments.</p>
<p>The West Bank — which Israel has occupied since 1967 — is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. Most proposals for an independent Palestinian state have involved Israel ceding control over the vast majority of the West Bank.</p><p>If Israel annexed some or all of the West Bank, formally entrenching its control over the territory, it could make forming a Palestinian state virtually impossible. The move could also upset U.S.-allied Arab countries, some of which have sought to improve their relations with Israel.</p><p>Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, calling the growing pressure on the issue an "absurd prize for terrorism" last weekend.</p><p>Netanyahu's government has faced increasing international pressure over its handling of the Israel-Hamas war, which has destroyed much of the Gaza Strip's infrastructure and killed more than 60,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were militants or civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has pressed Israel and Hamas to strike a ceasefire deal that could result in the remaining Israeli hostages being freed, but an agreement has remained elusive.</p>

<div class="article-title">What schools stand to lose in the battle over the next federal education budget</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The battle over next year's federal education budget has begun.</p> <p>Congress and the White House have released not one, not two, but <em>three</em> competing funding visions for the nation's K-12 schools in fiscal year 2026. And education researchers warn that two of those three proposals — from the White House and House Republicans — would impose steep cuts on some of the United States' most vulnerable students and disadvantaged school communities.</p> <h3 class="edTag">The three proposals on the table</h3> <p>First up, President Trump's proposed budget would cut U.S. Department of Education funding by 15%. It would eliminate all funding ($1.3 billion) for English language learners and migrant students. It would also combine 18 funding streams — including help for rural schools, civics education, at-risk youth and students experiencing homelessness — and cut them from roughly $6.5 billion down to $2 billion.</p>
<p>The White House has defended this consolidation, saying it "requires fewer Federal staff and empowers States and districts to make spending decisions based on their needs."</p> <p>The second proposal, from House Republicans, would push for even deeper K-12 cuts, notably a $4.7 billion reduction in funding that supports schools in low-income communities. This funding stream, known as Title I, has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades and currently sends roughly $18 billion to schools in disadvantaged communities all over the United States.</p> <p>In a news release heralding the legislation, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Republican Tom Cole of Oklahoma, said, "Change doesn't come from keeping the status quo—it comes from making bold, disciplined choices."</p> <p>And the<strong> </strong>third proposal, from the Senate, would make minor cuts but largely maintain funding.</p> <p>A quick reminder: Federal funding makes up a relatively small share of school budgets, roughly 11%, though cuts in low-income districts can still be painful and disruptive.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Schools in blue congressional districts could lose more money</h3> <p>Researchers at the liberal-leaning think tank New America wanted to know how the impact of these proposals might vary depending on the politics of the congressional district receiving the money. They found that the Trump budget would subtract an average of about $35 million from each district's K-12 schools, with those led by Democrats losing slightly more than those led by Republicans.</p>
<p>The House proposal would make deeper, more partisan cuts, with districts represented by Democrats losing an average of about $46 million and Republican-led districts losing about $36 million.</p> <p>Republican leadership of the House Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for this budget proposal, did not respond to an NPR request for comment on this partisan divide.</p> <p>"In several cases, we've had to make some very hard choices," Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., a top Republican on the appropriations committee, said during the full-committee markup of the bill. "Americans must make priorities as they sit around their kitchen tables about the resources they have within their family. And we should be doing the same thing."</p>
<p>The Senate proposal is more moderate and would leave the status quo largely intact.</p> <p>In addition to the work of New America, the liberal-leaning Learning Policy Institute created this tool to compare the potential impact of the Senate bill with the president's proposal.</p> <h3 class="edTag">High-poverty schools could lose more than low-poverty schools</h3> <p>The Trump and House proposals would disproportionately hurt high-poverty school districts, according to an analysis by the liberal-leaning EdTrust.</p>
<p>In Kentucky, for example, EdTrust estimates that the president's budget could cost the state's highest-poverty school districts $359 per student, nearly three times what it would cost its wealthiest districts.</p> <p>The cuts are even steeper in<strong> </strong>the House proposal: Kentucky's highest-poverty schools could lose $372 per student, while its lowest-poverty schools could lose $143 per child.</p> <p>The Senate bill would cut far less: $37 per child in the state's highest-poverty school districts versus $12 per student in its lowest-poverty districts.</p> <p>New America researchers arrived at similar conclusions when studying congressional districts.</p> <p>"The lowest-income congressional districts would lose one and a half times as much funding as the richest congressional districts under the Trump budget," says New America's Zahava Stadler.</p> <p>The House proposal, Stadler says, would go further, imposing a cut the Trump budget does not on Title I.</p> <p>"The House budget does something new and scary," Stadler says, "which is it openly targets funding for students in poverty. This is not something that we see <em>ever</em>."</p> <p>Republican leaders of the House Appropriations Committee did not respond to NPR requests for comment on their proposal's outsize impact on low-income communities.</p> <p>The Senate has proposed a modest increase to Title I for next year.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Majority-minority schools could lose more than mostly white schools</h3> <p>Just as the president's budget would hit high-poverty schools hard, New America found that it would also have an outsize impact on congressional districts where schools serve predominantly children of color. These districts would lose nearly twice as much funding as predominantly white districts, in what Stadler calls "a huge, huge disparity<em>."</em></p>
<p>One of several drivers of that disparity is the White House's decision to end all funding for English language learners and migrant students. In one budget document, the White House justified cutting the former by arguing the program "deemphasizes English primacy. ... The historically low reading scores for all students mean States and communities need to unite—not divide—classrooms."</p> <p>Under the House proposal, according to New America, congressional districts that serve predominantly white students would lose roughly $27 million on average, while districts with schools that serve mostly children of color would lose more than twice as much: nearly $58 million.</p>
<p>EdTrust's data tool tells a similar story, state by state. For example, under the president's budget, Pennsylvania school districts that serve the most students of color would lose $413 per student. Districts that serve the fewest students of color would lose just $101 per child.</p> <p>The findings were similar for the House proposal: a $499-per-student cut in Pennsylvania districts that serve the most students of color versus a $128 cut per child in predominantly white districts.</p> <p>"That was most surprising to me," says EdTrust's Ivy Morgan. "Overall, the House proposal really is worse [than the Trump budget] for high-poverty districts, districts with high percentages of students of color, city and rural districts. And we were not expecting to see that."</p> <p>The Trump and House proposals do share one common denominator: the belief that the federal government should be spending less on the nation's schools.</p> <p>When Trump pledged, "We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs," that apparently included scaling back some of the federal role in funding schools, too.</p> <p>The challenge for states, communities and families, if one of these budgets becomes a reality, will be filling that funding void, especially since the federal government has always focused its dollars on helping students and schools that need it the most.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump's TikTok deal payment criticized as 'shake-down scheme' by experts</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The Trump administration recently approached a coalition of U.S. investors set to take over TikTok's U.S. operations with an ask: Will the group make a payment to the federal government "in the low billions," according to a person with direct knowledge of the talks.</p>
<p>The response from the investors, which includes tech mogul Larry Ellison, the Murdochs and venture capital heavyweight Andreessen Horowitz, was an unequivocal yes.</p> <p>"Not a single member balked," said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly. "They see it as something of a finders' fee."</p> <p>Welcome to President Trump's new business agenda: Extracting payments as if the federal government is brokering deals like a white-shoe consulting firm fueled by lucrative "fees for service."</p>
<p>Whether it's the U.S. taking 15% of Nvidia and AMD's chip sales to China, the federal government securing a "golden share" in U.S. Steel or the Trump administration reportedly seeking an equity stake in Lithium Americas as part of a government loan negotiation, the White House is on a campaign of squeezing businesses with few parallels in modern history.</p> <p>"At a minimum, this now means there is a tax imposed on every major business transaction," said Luigi Zingales, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago. "But even worse, businesses will no longer be focused on innovating and creating value and instead the whole game now is rent-seeking. It's all about ingratiating yourself with Trump."</p> <p>The White House did not return a request for comment.</p> <p>Asked on Thursday about the multibillion-dollar fee expected to be tacked onto the TikTok deal, which was earlier reported by <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> Trump was evasive.</p> <p>"We're going to be announcing different things, but the U.S. comes out great," Trump said from the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Trump has been more direct about defending his administration's private business interventions, including after Intel agreed to sell a 10% stake of the company to the U.S. government following Trump's calls for its chief executive to resign.</p>
<p>"The United States paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars. This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL," Trump posted last month.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Many media companies capitulate to Trump pressure</h3> <p>This pattern has played out across media, where Trump's longtime war against news organizations has escalated into marshaling the might of the federal government to force concessions.</p>
<p>The parent companies for ABC and CBS both settled lawsuits for $16 million following Trump lawsuits alleging mistreatment by the networks. The payments went to Trump's presidential library foundation and Trump's legal fees. Shortly after CBS's payment, federal regulators approved the sale of its parent company, Paramount, to Skydance Media, which is controlled by the Ellison family.</p>
<p>Media companies were already signaling their acquiescence to Trump before he won a second term.</p> <p>Ahead of the election, the billionaire owners of <em>The Washington Post</em> and <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> killed parallel editorial endorsements of Kamala Harris. They soon rewired their editorial pages to be less critical of Trump. Both owners — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for the <em>Post </em>and medical innovator Dr.<em> </em>Patrick Soon-Shiong for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> —have major business interests that hinge on decisions by federal officials.</p>
<p>Then there is Jimmy Kimmel. Last week, Disney — which owns ABC — suspended the late-night host after Federal Communications Chairman Brendan Carr threatened action over Kimmel's remarks about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. After a public outcry, including from First Amendment scholars, Kimmel returned, on Tuesday, with the blessing of ABC and Disney.</p>
<p>Trump lashed out at the network's reversal.</p> <p>"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back," Trump wrote on Truth Social, writing in the same post: "I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars."</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Trump allies landing deals sparks criticism of "crony capitalism"</h3> <p>Among those the Trump White House has lined up to take the reins of TikTok's U.S. operation are Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, the controlling owners of Fox News, <em>The New York Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.</p> <p>From one view, it can be seen as recognition of the friendly coverage the president often receives from Fox and <em>The Post</em>.</p>
<p>But Trump and Murdoch have also been at odds. That strife was highlighted in July when Trump sued <em>The Journal </em>and Murdoch over the paper's reporting on the disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein.</p> <p>The Murdochs' role in the take-over of America's most popular video app is a remarkable victory for the family and follows a relationship that has at times been combative.</p>
<p>"If you look at Fox News on the one hand and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> editorial page on the other, I think it's very clear that Rupert Murdoch wants to have bets on every square on the roulette table," says Richard Tofel, who was the former assistant publisher of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> prior to Murdoch's 2007 acquisition of the paper.</p> <p>But most of the stakeholders in the TikTok investment group are business leaders who have shown sustained loyalty to the president, which makes the deal look like a reward for fealty, Tofel says.</p> <p>"There is a growing set of examples of crony capitalism that the Trump administration is putting into place across this country," says Tofel, a lawyer who later went on to become president of the non-profit investigative news site ProPublica. "American industry — which would have regarded this behavior from a Democrat as anathema and inconsistent with the tenets of unfettered capitalism — is rolling over for it time after time."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Experts say U.S. economy being undermined by 'shake-down schemes'</h3> <p>The exact template has varied. In the case of TikTok, the administration is seeking a fee for service. With Intel, the federal government is acquiring an equity stake. For chip-makers Nvidia and AMD, meanwhile, the demand was for a slice of future profits. And with the network television settlements, the payouts arose after personal legal disputes.</p>
<p>"There is no consistent principle at play, just the exercise of Trump's personal power over other people's money," said Dael Norwood, associate professor of history at the University of Delaware, who notes that the winners and losers are clear.</p> <p>"All Americans – taxpayers, investors, customers, and workers – lose with crony capitalism," he said. "It increases everyone's costs, makes everyone more vulnerable to extortion (or worse), and profoundly degrades our expectations for honesty and fair dealing, society-wide."</p> <p>In public, corporate executives show support to the president and appear to back such deals, but behind closed doors, some business leaders are expressing deep concern.</p>
<p>Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld recently helped organize a gathering of more than 100 top CEOs, and he said there was near-unanimous consensus in surveys conducted at the event that Trump's interventions in private business are undermining America's free market principles.</p> <p>"These are shake-down schemes. It's a gross violation of what capitalism is supposed to stand for. I'd even call it extortion," Sonnenfeld said. "Privately, CEOs are horrified."</p> <p>But Sonnenfeld said executives are not banding together to push back on Trump, as top business leaders did following Trump's election denialism in November 2020.</p> <p>"CEOs need to speak up, like they did then, but they aren't doing it publicly," Sonnenfeld said. "Fear of retaliation is motivating the silence, but there has got to be a trigger line to stop this,"We just don't know what that is yet."</p> <p>Talks with American investors for a potential acquisition of TikTok's U.S. enterprise have been moving in fits and starts for the past five years, starting back when the Trump administration declared the Chinese-owned hit video app to be a national security threat and sought to have it banned.</p> <p>Since Trump's about-face and embrace of TikTok, it has been clear that software and cloud-computing company Oracle would be a major player in the bid to take over the app's American presence.</p>

<div class="article-title">Fired feds, Trump lovers and veterans: Meet the people applying for ICE jobs</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>PROVO, Utah — On a sunny Monday morning, dozens of people trickled into the Utah Valley Convention Center in this town enveloped by mountains south of Salt Lake City. Some wore suits, others high heels, and nearly all carried small binders with resumes, certificates and diplomas.</p> <p>They were veterans, current law enforcement officials, college graduates and fired federal workers.</p> <p>They came from California, Texas, Georgia, Arkansas and Utah.</p> <p>And they want to be deportation officers, or work for other parts of the Department of Homeland Security, the agency leading President Trump's mass deportation policy.</p> <p>The Trump administration wants to recruit 10,000 people for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a branch of DHS, using congressional funds approved earlier this summer. The administration's goal is to deport one million people a year. But that target is unlikely to be easy to hit: The lack of personnel to conduct arrests, investigate and litigate cases has been among the biggest challenges to increasing the pace of arrests, detentions and deportations.</p>
<p>NPR spoke with more than 30 people at the DHS career expo held in Provo last week. This was the first agency-wide career fair after Congress approved funds to recruit candidates for positions beyond immigration enforcement, including for the Secret Service, Federal Protective Police and the Transportation Security Administration, which like ICE are all part of DHS. Interviews conducted by NPR suggest many of the people who had traveled across state lines to Utah wanted to work in immigration enforcement.</p> <p>More than 1,500 people registered for the event, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in a statement. DHS extended 500 tentative job offers, with 370 for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.</p> <p>"Many of the candidates who attended the expo had started the application process before attending and were completing things on their to-do list, such as drug tests, finger printing, and more," McLaughlin said. "Attending the in-person career expo helped candidates expedite their hiring process with a one-stop shop to complete their applications."</p> <p>ICE had about 20,000 people at the start of the year, 6,000 of them in roles directly conducting deportations. Last week ICE boasted receiving more than 150,000 applications nationwide and extending 18,000 tentative job offers — though it is unclear how many will ultimately see a first day on the job.</p>
<p>DHS officials have raised concerns over what they said is a 1,000% increase in threats to their officers. Officials reiterated that statistic after a fatal shooting at the Dallas ICE field office this week killed one person and injured two others — all immigrants detained there — and bullets were found with the words "ANTI-ICE."</p> <p>Acting Director Todd Lyons told CNN after the shooting that the threats have not negatively affected recruitment efforts.</p> <p>"There's really excitement for people that want to serve, not just necessarily ICE but want to serve in a federal law enforcement capacity, especially at a time when assaults and attacks on law enforcement are increasing," Lyons said. "We are seeing a great uptick in our recruitment, so people definitely want to do the job."</p> <h3 class="edTag">The recruits</h3> <p>As part of its recruitment campaign, DHS offered signing bonuses, lifted age restrictions and roped in celebrities like actor Dean Cain, who played Clark Kent/Superman in <em>Lois and Clark</em>, to encourage more people to apply.</p> <p>Ana Maria Vargas, 52, a correctional officer in Arizona, applied to be a deportation officer.</p>
<p>"I saw … the guy that played Superman on the TV series so many years ago," Vargas said. "A lot of us still have the desire and want to serve our country, yet we don't know how to get into it because of the age restrictions."</p> <p>Vargas said she wants to "take out the bad guys," though she acknowledged "there are a lot of good people that are here. However, they are here illegally."</p> <p>Andrea Alexander, an attorney living in Utah, came to apply for the Office of the Principal Legal Advisor, the branch of ICE that argues immigration cases in immigration court. She learned of ICE's recruitment efforts from White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller's social media.</p> <p>"I love Trump. I love his administration. I think he's going to save our country," Alexander said, adding that those applying to be deportation officers should likely believe in the mission as well. "They probably have to be true believers for the front line because they have to be ready to catch a lot of flak right now."</p>
<p>Still, Alexander said she wanted to see efforts to increase legal migration and visa reform.</p> <p>"We've made it almost impossible for people to immigrate legally. It's very difficult and they should be able to come over," she added.</p> <p>Another applicant, Peter, who did not want to disclose his last name since he is applying to be a deportation officer, flew to Utah from Arkansas.</p> <p>He said he was on the right of the political spectrum and that the hiring bonuses and increased media attention on the agency drew his attention.</p> <p>"I think there's way too many illegal immigrants here," he said, noting that if he gets the job, he hopes he gets to deport people. </p> <h3 class="edTag">Former federal employees seek a second chance</h3><h3 class="edTag"></h3> <p>Sherrell Pyatt was one of several DHS employees laid off as part of a broader effort to reduce the size of the federal government. NPR reported her story in April. But months later, she flew from Georgia to Utah with the hopes of being rehired at the agency that let her go.</p> <p><strong>"</strong>I want to be judged on my qualifications, my credentials, and I don't feel like I've been given that opportunity," Pyatt said, noting that her severance had ended in August.</p> <p>She wanted to apply for a role with the fraud investigations unit of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. After working in the federal government for 10 years, Pyatt, who worked in the federal government for a decade, said that she wants to continue her service and believes she should have priority to be rehired since she was a part of a reduction in force, but is competing with external candidates.</p>
<p>"If there is an opportunity where I could plug into something that would work for me and my skill set, I would, of course, apply," she said.</p>
<p>Other laid-off federal workers, including from other agencies, as well as contractors, came to the expo to look for opportunities.</p> <p>Eddie — who did not provide a last name since he is applying for a role with Homeland Security Investigations, which is a part of ICE, and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services — previously worked as a federal contractor to vet the sponsors of unaccompanied migrant children.</p> <p>"My dad's been with law enforcement at Homeland Security now for 17 years and he does pretty well. So I firsthand see the benefits of it," he said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Concerns over DHS's widespread recruitment comes from all sides</h3> <p>The numbers at the recruitment events notwithstanding, ICE's recruitment strategies have not all been well received.</p> <p>Utah County Sheriff Mike Smith, who has an agreement to assist ICE in the Provo area, called an initial call to recruit local law enforcement "unprofessional" in an interview with NPR. The recruitment fair in Provo, as well as an ICE-specific fair in Texas, were met with scattered protests.</p> <p>RJ Hauman, a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he supports the administration's immigration enforcement goals, but said he is skeptical about the recruitment campaign.</p>
<p>"When you're recruiting large numbers of qualified candidates, you got to consider how you get them to the finish line," Hauman said. "Rather than doing ads that ICE is hiring, all these onsite job fairs, let's start hammering out more facilities to train these potential agents and streamline the vetting, the background check, make sure you get the right people and you don't make a mistake."</p> <p>Critics say the modification of requirements, including a reduced training period, could result in hiring candidates with less experience. The agency insists standards aren't being lowered: ICE law enforcement recruits will still be required to go through medical screening, drug screening and a physical fitness test. </p>
<h3 class="edTag">Just another job</h3> <p>ICE's enforcement efforts have made the agency the focus of negative attention, protests and lawsuits. But like for many who work in the federal government, the politics of the moments are irrelevant.</p> <p>John Heubert, who expects to retire from the Army next summer, came from Georgia to apply to be a deportation officer.</p> <p>"I feel like I could do good in that realm. I've been military for 23 years. I've worked in detainee operations for a long time," Heubert said. "So I feel like leveraging my skills, and deployments, and everything would help kind of transition me easier into the civilian life, doing kind of the same thing I've been doing."</p> <p>He said everything has been politicized, so the controversy surrounding the agency did not deter him.</p> <p>"I'm the guy that just executes at this point. So whatever they want, they tell me to do it, I go do," Heubert said.</p> <p>Alan Richardson, who came to the expo from Utah, is another veteran. He learned of the expo from a friend's post on LinkedIn.</p> <p>"I want to go back into federal service … and retire earlier than have to start a whole another career with a state or county agency," he said, noting he is interested in border patrol, Secret Service and ICE.</p> <p>"As a law enforcement officer, you don't get to pick and choose which laws to enforce. You enforce them as they are on the books," Heubert said. "There is no politics behind it. If you want to change laws, you have to go to Congress. That's simply all it is."</p> <p>Richardson said that he supports the effort to arrest and deport criminals.</p> <p>"If your employer says you have to do something, you've got to go do it. That's any business in the country. Everyone can have an opinion," Richardson said. "But I think going after the criminals is the goal here. There's no way you're going to deport how many millions of people that are here illegally."</p>
<p>Eric Garibay, an immigration detention officer, said he drove over 12 hours from El Paso, Texas, to attend the fair. Speaking to NPR in Spanish, he said it has always been his goal to be a border patrol agent.</p> <p>"It's a job and a career that I chose, so you have to move forward," he said.</p> <p>As for the people he'd be detaining, he said: "It hurts to see. They're human, but a job is a job."</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump's Tylenol warning echoes past misconceptions about mothers and autism</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>This week, President Trump urged pregnant women to "tough it out" and take Tylenol sparingly on the basis that there's a link between the active ingredient in the pain killer, acetaminophen, and autism.</p> <p>Medical experts have strongly pushed back on the guidance, arguing that such claims are misleading and research shows there's no causal link between acetaminophen and autism. The Food and Drug Administration also later clarified that "while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature."</p>
<p>Still, the remarks on Monday sparked confusion, worry and guilt among pregnant women and families with children who have autism. Medical scholars say it's part of a pattern in the history of medicine and autism research.</p> <p>" We really have a long history of blaming mothers in this country, and we're seeing that reinforced through the narratives around autism's causes right now," said Martine Lappé, a sociology professor at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, who has studied how autism science and advocacy have affected families.</p> <p>Autism spectrum disorder, as it is officially called, is a complex neurodevelopmental condition, with a wide range of characteristics and support levels. There are more than 100 genes associated with it. Historically, efforts to find a singular cause for autism has led to scrutinizing parents and fueling stigma about autism, Lappé added.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>In the mid-20th century, working moms were wrongly associated with autism </strong></h3> <p>In the 1940s, not long after autism was recognized as a distinct condition, blame quickly fell on mothers — specifically those with careers or college degrees.</p> <p>The leading child psychiatrist at the time, Leo Kanner, observed that many of his young patients with autism had mothers who were highly educated or working professionals, and also seemed emotionally cold. Kanner concluded that a lack of parental warmth drove children to retreat into behaviors associated with autism, in what later became known as the "refrigerator mom" theory.</p>
<p>" A cold mother, at the time, pretty much meant an intellectual mother, a mother who had other interests besides raising her children," said Marga Vicedo, a historian of science at the University of Toronto, Canada, who has published a book on the history of the "refrigerator mom" theory.</p> <p>According to Vicedo, the number of educated mothers in Kanner's studies could have been explained by other factors, like the fact that many of them came from middle-to-upper class backgrounds, where higher education was more common.</p>
<p>Still, the concept grew in popularity — in part because it emerged amid growing tensions between women entering the workforce and societal pressure for women to return to traditional roles at home in the post-World War II era.</p> <p>"At the end of day, saying it's a mother's fault is a very strong and powerful way of keeping mothers as the main caretakers," she said.</p> <p>The "refrigerator mom" theory had devastating impacts on mothers — fueling shame, guilt and even harmful practices. In the 1960s, child psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim advocated for separating autistic children from their mothers, according to Vicedo.</p> <p>Over time, as research increasingly pointed to genetics as a major factor in autism, the theory was discredited. Parents and specifically mothers also became more vocal in challenging claims that they were to blame.</p> <p>Today, Vicedo said she sees parallels between the rhetoric around "refrigerator moms" and "Tylenol" — mainly in the tendency to pin autism on a singular cause, despite its complexity.</p> <p>"The continued focus on what mothers do places a tremendous burden and a lot of stress on them," she said.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Vaccine skepticism and the tendency to oversimplify autism </strong></h3> <p>A few decades after the "refrigerator mom" theory was debunked, a new culprit was front and center: vaccines.</p> <p>In 1998, researcher Andrew Wakefield claimed there was a link between autism and the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, also known as the MMR vaccine.</p>
<p>Wakefield's study has since been retracted, his claim has been repeatedly disproven and he lost his medical license in the U.K. But that process took time and resources which could have gone toward other autism research, according to Lappé from Cal Poly.</p> <p>Similar to the "refrigerator mom" theory, Lappé said the vaccine autism myth placed too much focus on parents' choices for a condition that's largely genetic and multi-faceted.</p> <p>"Mothers, I think, felt a lot of individual blame and responsibility if their children did have autism," she said.</p> <p>According to Lappé, these misleading narratives on causation also take attention away from more meaningful and productive conversations, like access to healthcare, childcare and research that promotes neurodiversity.</p> <p>" If the goal is truly to promote health and wellness, then we need policies that support what we know mothers and caregivers need," she said.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Tylenol and the pressure to 'tough it out'</strong></h3> <p>Medical experts and scholars worry that the recent claims about Tylenol put pregnant women and families in a difficult bind.</p> <p>" It really puts women and mothers and medical providers in this really challenging situation because women are now being told differing stories from different individuals," said Dr. Rachel Follmer, a developmental and behavioral pediatrician at Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, who sees patients with autism.</p> <p>Follmer is also worried that pregnant women might avoid treating pain altogether to steer clear of Tylenol, which is the most commonly recommended pain reliever during pregnancy. Ignoring fevers or pain can also pose serious health risks, Follmer added.</p>
<p>According to the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, an "untreated fever, particularly in the first trimester, increases the risk of miscarriage, birth defects, and premature birth."</p> <p>Sarah Richardson, a professor of the history of science, as well as studies of women, gender and sexuality at Harvard University, said the remarks about Tylenol also put women in a position to be scrutinized, like whether they are doing enough or sacrificing enough for their children.</p> <p>" We live in an era of intensive pressure around parenting and expectations that one will do whatever possible to optimize outcome," she said. "And there's very little tolerance for the idea that there are many things not under our control."<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">LA County response to deadly fires slowed by lack of resources, report says</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>LOS ANGELES — A lack of resources and outdated policies for sending emergency alerts led to delayed evacuation warnings as flames began consuming neighborhoods during deadly Los Angeles-area wildfires in January, according to an outside review.</p>
<p>The Independent After-Action Report produced by the consulting firm McChrystal Group was commissioned by Los Angeles County supervisors just weeks after the Eaton and Palisades fires killed more than 30 people and destroyed thousands of homes in and around Pacific Palisades and Altadena.</p> <p>The report released Thursday says a series of weaknesses, including "outdated policies, inconsistent practices and communications vulnerabilities," hampered the county's response.</p> <p>Interviews with survivors and an Associated Press analysis of available data found evacuation orders for some neighborhoods of Altadena where the Eaton Fire swept through came long after houses burned down. AP reporting also showed similar delays for the Palisades Fire, though the Los Angeles Police Department initially handled evacuation management. The report sheds more light on flaws in the county alert system.</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>Staffing shortages</strong></h3> <p>The report cites critical staffing shortages including a high number of sheriff's deputy vacancies and an under-resourced Office of Emergency Management. In addition, first responders and incident commanders were unable to consistently share information due to unreliable cellular connectivity, inconsistent field reporting methods, and the use of various unconnected communication platforms.</p>
<p>"While frontline responders acted decisively and, in many cases, heroically, in the face of extraordinary conditions, the events underscored the need for clearer policies, stronger training, integrated tools, and improved public communication," the report says.</p> <p>It is not intended to investigate or assess blame, county officials said in a news release.</p> <p>"This isn't about pointing fingers. It's about learning lessons, improving safety, and restoring public trust," said Supervisor Kathryn Barger, whose district includes Altadena.</p> <p>The Office of Emergency Management began putting together its staffing plan for predicted heavy winds Jan. 3, four days before the Palisades and Eaton fires ignited. But an experienced staffer had been sent out of town for a training event. That meant several less-knowledgeable staffers were in key positions, according to the report.</p>
<p>They were also working with some new emergency notification software provided by an existing vendor: The county signed the expanded contract with emergency alert company Genasys in November, just before the holidays. Only four staff members were trained on Genasys when the fires hit, according to the report.</p>
<p>The review also found that the process to communicate an evacuation decision to the public was slow, convoluted and involved multiple leadership roles across county-level departments.</p> <p>In the case of the Palisades Fire, the Los Angeles County Fire Department and Sheriff's Department identified areas that required evacuation. </p>
<p>They then communicated those areas to a member of the County's Office of Emergency Management at the Incident Command center. This person then made a phone call or sent a text message to another OEM staffer located in the Emergency Operations Center, who then updated the system put in place by the third-party vendor and triggered an alert to the public.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Alerting the public</strong></h3> <p>During the January inferno, according to the report, this process took between 20 and 30 minutes. That's an improvement over the old system that took between 30 and 60 minutes for the public to receive notice of an evacuation, the report said.</p> <p>Still, many of the county's methods to alert the public require opting in.</p>
<p>Some of the evacuation alerts required residents to click a separate link to get complete information, hindering messaging. The communication system used for alerts did not provide complete information about the fire's progression. Power outages and cell tower issues further hindered evacuation notices and the fire was moving too fast to keep up, the report found.</p> <p>Before the fire, the county sent out a handful of warnings about the incoming Santa Ana wind event and amplified National Weather Service messaging on social media and in news releases, but there was no official, stand-alone preparedness messaging provided by the county.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Challenges during evacuations</strong></h3> <p>Some sheriff's department vehicles were aiding with evacuations in the Palisades area when the Eaton Fire broke out across the county. Those units headed to help evacuate residents in Altadena, along with responders from other agencies including search and rescue teams and staff from a downtown LA jail.</p> <p>Still, a shortage of vehicles hindered the sheriff's department response across neighborhoods where the Eaton Fire was burning.</p>
<p>"Vulnerable populations, especially older residents who were not monitoring alerts due to a digital divide and possible mobility challenges, faced increased risks of delayed evacuation," the authors wrote.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>What went right</strong></h3> <p>The authors praised the heroism of first responders including sheriff's deputies and county firefighters who evacuated senior care facilities, led public transit bus drivers through impacted neighborhoods and rescued people from burning homes.</p>
<p>"This heroic response was driven by urgency and their commitment to save lives, but it also added additional complexity to their responsibilities as they worked to maintain broader operational oversight in the field," the authors wrote.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to review the 133-page report when it meets next Tuesday.</p> <p>The causes of the two fires are still under investigation.</p>
<p>After-action reports and investigations revealed issues with alert systems in other California blazes: in the 2017 Tubbs Fire, which killed 22 people in Santa Rosa; the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed 85 people in Paradise; the Woolsley fire, which started the same day and killed three in Malibu; as well as in Colorado's 2021 Marshall Fire, which destroyed more than 1,000 homes outside Denver; and in Hawaii's 2023 Lahaina Fire, which decimated that historic town and killed 102.  </p>

<div class="article-title">Human remains identified as Travis Decker, wanted for killing his daughters</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>WENATCHEE, Wash. — Forensic tests confirmed that human remains found on a remote mountain in Washington state this month were those of Travis Decker, a former soldier wanted for killing his three young daughters last spring, officials confirmed Thursday.</p>
<p>His remains were discovered on a steep, remote, wooded slope part way up Grindstone Mountain in central Washington, less than a mile (1.6 km) from the campsite where the bodies of 9-year-old Paityn Decker, 8-year-old Evelyn Decker and 5-year-old Olivia Decker were found on June 2, the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said.</p> <p>Law enforcement teams had been searching more than three months for Decker, 32, before the sheriff's office announced last week it had located human remains believed to be his. Sheriff Mike Morrison said Thursday that DNA tests on clothing found at the scene as well as from the remains matched Decker.</p>
<p>The sheriff said investigators wanted to honor the girls' memory by solving the case, and he apologized to their mother, Whitney Decker, that it took so long.</p> <p>"I hope you can rest easier at night knowing that Travis is accounted for," Morrison said.</p> <p>Decker had been with his daughters on a scheduled visit but failed bring them back to his former wife, who a year ago said that his mental health issues had worsened and that he had become increasingly unstable.</p>
<p>He was often living out of his truck, she said in a petition seeking to restrict him from having overnight visits with them.</p> <p>A deputy found Decker's truck as well as the girls' bodies three days after Decker failed to return them to their mother's house. Autopsies found the girls had been suffocated.</p> <p>Decker was an infantryman in the Army from March 2013 to July 2021 and deployed to Afghanistan for four months in 2014. He had training in navigation, survival and other skills, authorities said, and once spent more than two months living in the backwoods off the grid.</p> <p>More than 100 officials with an array of state and federal agencies searched hundreds of square miles, much of it mountainous and remote, by land, water and air during the on and off search. The U.S. Marshals Service offered a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his capture.</p>
<p>At one point early in the search, authorities thought they spotted Decker near a remote alpine lake after receiving a tip from hikers.</p> <p>Officials say the coroner's office continues to work on determining the cause and time of his death.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump to place import taxes on drugs, home furnishings and heavy trucks</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will put import taxes of 100% on pharmaceutical drugs, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30% on upholstered furniture and 25% on heavy trucks starting on Oct. 1.</p> <p>The posts on his social media site showed that Trump's devotion to tariffs did not end with the trade frameworks and import taxes that were launched in August, a reflection of the president's confidence that taxes will help to reduce the government's budget deficit while increasing domestic manufacturing.</p> <p>While Trump did not provide a legal justification for the tariffs, he appeared to stretch the bounds of his role as commander-in-chief by stating on Truth Social that the taxes on imported kitchen cabinets and sofas were needed "for National Security and other reasons."</p>
<p>Under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the administration launched a Section 232 investigation in April about the impacts on national security from pharmaceutical drug and truck imports. The Commerce Department launched a 232 investigation into timber and lumber in March, though it's unclear whether the furniture tariffs stem from that.</p>
<p>The tariffs are another dose of uncertainty for the U.S. economy with a solid stock market but a weakening outlook for jobs and elevated inflation. These new taxes on imports could pass through to consumers in the form of higher prices and dampen hiring, a process that economic data suggests is already underway.</p> <p>"We have begun to see goods prices showing through into higher inflation," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned in a recent news conference, adding that higher costs for goods account for "most" or potentially "all" of the increase in inflation levels this year.</p> <p>The president has pressured Powell to resign, arguing that the Fed should cut its benchmark interest rates more aggressively because inflation is no longer a concern. Fed officials have stayed cautious on rate cuts because of the uncertainty created by tariffs.</p> <p>Trump said on Truth Social that the pharmaceutical tariffs would not apply to companies that are building manufacturing plants in the United States, which he defined as either "breaking ground" or being "under construction." It was unclear how the tariffs would apply to companies that already have factories in the U.S.</p>
<p>In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shock waves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.</p> <p>The pharmaceutical drug announcement was shocking as Trump has previously suggested that tariffs would be phased in over time so that companies had time to build factories and relocate production. On CNBC in August, Trump said he would start by charging a "small tariff" on pharmaceuticals and raise the rate over a year or more to 150% and even 250%.</p> <p>According to the White House, the threat of tariffs earlier this year contributed to many major pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, Roche, Bristol Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly, among others, to announce investments in U.S. production.</p> <p>Pascal Chan, vice president for strategic policy and supply chains at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, warned that the tariffs could harm Americans' health with "immediate price hikes, strained insurance systems, hospital shortages, and the real risk of patients rationing or foregoing essential medicines."</p> <p>The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates. The National Association of Realtors on Thursday said there were signs of price pressures easing as sales listings increased 11.7% in August from a year ago, but the median price for an existing home was $422,600.</p> <p>Trump said that foreign-made heavy trucks and parts are hurting domestic producers that need to be defended.</p> <p>"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions," Trump posted.</p> <p>Trump has long maintained that tariffs are the key to forcing companies to invest more in domestic factories. He has dismissed fears that importers would simply pass along much of the cost of the taxes to consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices.</p>
<p>His broader country-by-country tariffs relied on declaring an economic emergency based on a 1977 law, a drastic tax hike that two federal courts said exceeded Trump's authority as president. The Supreme Court is set to hear the case in November.</p> <p>The president continues to claim that inflation is no longer a challenge for the U.S. economy, despite evidence to the contrary. The consumer price index has increased 2.9% over the past 12 months, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.</p> <p>Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.</p> <p>"There's no inflation," Trump told reporters Thursday. "We're having unbelievable success."</p> <p>Still, Trump also acknowledged that his tariffs against China had hurt American farmers, who lost out on sales of soybeans. The president separately promised on Thursday to divert tariff revenues to the farmers hurt by the conflict, just as he did during his first term in 2018 and 2019 when his tariffs led to retaliation against the agricultural sector.</p>

<p>The Justice Department has leveled charges against former FBI Director James Comey, after President Trump demanded prosecutors speed up their pace in an investigation targeting one of his most prominent critics.</p> <p>Comey faces one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice in connection with his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee nearly five years ago. The move comes days after the top federal prosecutor in Northern Virginia cast doubt on the evidence, only to be forced out by the president and replaced with one of Trump's former defense attorneys.</p>
<p>"No one is above the law.," Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X. "Today's indictment reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people."</p> <p>Trump has long railed against Comey, blaming the former FBI leader for the appointment of a special prosecutor who probed contacts between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign through most of the president's first term in office. </p>
<p>The charges against Comey mark the latest escalation in a years-long war of words between Trump and Comey, who famously likened the president to a mob boss.</p> <p>This year the Secret Service interrogated the former FBI director after he posted a photo of seashells in the shape of the numbers "86 47." Comey later removed the post, saying he thought it was a restaurant-themed joke about removing Trump, the 47<sup>th</sup> president. But Trump's son and cabinet members interpreted the message as an assassination threat. "Eighty-six" is a slang term that means "get rid of," and Trump is the 47th (and 45th) president of the United States. </p> <p>Comey once served as second in command at the Justice Department, under President George W. Bush. But he started his career as a federal prosecutor, working to some acclaim in the same office in Virginia that later moved to seek his indictment.</p>
<p>DOJ fired his daughter, Maurene Comey, from a prominent job as an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan earlier this year, only hours after she said she had been asked to lead an important public corruption case. </p> <p>This month, Maurene Comey sued current Justice Department leaders, arguing she was fired without cause and in violation of the Constitution and federal statutes. Her lawsuit said she thought she was dismissed because of "her father's protected speech, or because of her perceived political affiliation and beliefs, or both."</p>

<div class="article-title">Hollywood now has dueling open letters over the Israel film boycott</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>

<p>Hollywood is divided over the war in Gaza and is expressing it through dueling open letters.</p> <p>More than 5,000 actors and filmmakers, including Pedro Pascal, Javier Bardem and Selena Gomez, signed an open letter on Sept. 9 pledging to boycott Israeli film groups.</p> <p>Now, more than 1,200 other Hollywood figures, among them Liev Schreiber, Mayim Bialik and Sharon Osbourne, have signed a similar letter <em>rejecting</em> the boycott.</p>
<p>"We cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda," states the letter, which was published on Thursday by the entertainment industry nonprofits Creative Community For Peace and The Brigade.</p> <p>Condemning the first open letter as "a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art," the signers ask the entertainment industry to "reject this discriminatory and antisemitic boycott call that only adds another roadblock on the path to peace." </p>
<p>The letter goes on to say that the pledge "erases dissenting Israeli voices, legitimizes falsehoods, and shields Hamas from blame."</p> <p>Addressing the signers of the boycott pledge, the letter urges, "If you want peace, "call for the immediate release of the remaining hostages" and "stand against Hamas."</p> <p>People who signed the original letter pledged to avoid screening films or working with Israeli film institutions that they allege are "implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people." It was published in five languages by Filmmakers for Palestine – which describes itself as "a call by and for filmmakers and cinema workers to stand for an end to genocide, and for a free Palestine." Israel strongly denies allegations that it is committing genocide in Gaza.</p> <p>In addition to Pascal, Bardem and Gomez, the original letter was signed by Emma Stone, Gael Garcia Bernal, Alyssa Milano, Olivia Colman, Brian Cox and Ilana Glazer, among many others. Filmmakers included Ava DuVernay, Adam McKay and Yorgos Lanthimos.</p> <p>In a statement to NPR, Filmmakers for Palestine dismissed the letter from Creative Community for Peace as "nothing more than thinly veiled anti-Palestinian racism."</p>
<p>The new letter has fewer A-list talent among its signatories. But it includes such behind-the-scenes heavyweights as former Paramount Global chair Shari Redstone, Mattel chairman and CEO Ynon Kreiz, <em>Will &amp; Grace</em> creator David Kohan, and Fernando Szew, CEO of FOX Entertainment Global.</p> <p>The letter follows a response to the boycott by Paramount Studios, the only major studio to speak out on the call for a boycott. "Silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace," a statement issued on behalf of Paramount chief communications officer Melissa Zukerman on Sept. 12 reads. "The global entertainment industry should be encouraging artists to tell their stories and share their ideas with audiences throughout the world. We need more engagement and communication — not less."<br/></p>
