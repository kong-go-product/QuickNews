<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former NBA player Jason Collins is receiving treatment for a brain tumor, his family announced.</p><p>In a first-person essay published in Sports Illustrated in 2013, Collins wrote about his sexuality and became the first openly gay player in any of the four major North American men's professional sports leagues.</p><p>At the time, Collins said his public admission was the first time he had spoken about that aspect of his personal life beyond his family and close friends.</p><p>"No one wants to live in fear. I've always been scared of saying the wrong thing. I don't sleep well. I never have," Collins wrote in 2013. "But each time I tell another person, I feel stronger and sleep a little more soundly. It takes an enormous amount of energy to guard such a big secret. I've endured years of misery and gone to enormous lengths to live a lie. I was certain that my world would fall apart if anyone knew. And yet when I acknowledged my sexuality I felt whole for the first time."</p><p>Collins retired in 2014. His 13-year career included stops with the Nets organization, Memphis Grizzlies, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks, Boston Celtics, and Washington Wizards.</p><p>He returned to the Nets for the 2013-24 season, after the franchise moved to Brooklyn.</p><p>"Jason and his family welcome your support and prayers and kindly ask for privacy as they dedicate their attention to Jason’s health and well-being," his family said in a statement to the NBA.</p><p>Collins averaged 3.6 points and 3.7 rebounds in his career. In his best season, he averaged 6.4 points and 6.1 rebounds for the then-New Jersey Nets in 2004-05.</p><p>Collins currently serves as an ambassador for the NBA.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p><p> sports coverage on X the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Perhaps President Donald Trump's pregame speech lit a fire under Aaron Judge.</p><p>The New York Yankees superstar, who is looking to win his third MVP in four years, homered twice after meeting with Trump, who called him a "fantastic player," in the Bronx Bombers' 9-3 victory over the Detroit Tigers.</p><p>During his trip to the clubhouse on the 24th anniversary of the attacks on Sept. 11, Trump complimented Judge's 6-foot-7, 282-pound frame.</p><p></p><p>"If you have that much muscle, you have to hit the ball further," Trump said. "You’re a fantastic player."</p><p>Trump also joked that he wished Judge was "a little bigger."</p><p>Judge homered in both his first and second at-bats for his 45th and 46th home runs of the season. The second put him in a tie with Joe DiMaggio for fourth place on the Yankees' all-time home runs list with 361.</p><p>He was plunked on the first pitch of his third plate appearance, prompting many boos. He singled in the fifth and struck out looking in the seventh to go 3-for-4 on the night.</p><p>Judge is the reigning MVP but is currently battling Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh, who already has an MLB-high 53 homers albeit a .241 batting average and an OPS nearly 200 points lower than Judge's. If Juddge brings home the hardware this year, he would become the first Yankee to win back-to-back MVP Awards since Roger Maris in 1960 and 1961. </p><p>He would also be the first Yankees player to win the MVP Award three times in four years since DiMaggio did it from 1939 to 1942.</p><p>He also now has 100 RBI on the season and is four home runs away from the fourth 50-homer season of his career. He would join Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, and Babe Ruth as the only players with as many 50-homer campaigns.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleuer ripped into defensive lineman Kingsley Enagbare in the first quarter of the team’s game against the Washington Commanders on Thursday.</p><p>Amazon Prime Video host Kirk Herbstreit explained that Enagbare believed the Packers were going out onto the field to kick a field goal from the Commanders’ 33-yard line. Instead, Green Bay decided to go for it. The confusion caused the official to stand over the ball, slowing the Packers’ offense down.</p><p>The broadcast showed LaFleur yelling at Enagbare on the sidelines. The Packers turned the ball over on downs to start the game.</p><p>Enagbare, a fifth-round pick out of South Carolina, is in his fourth season with Green Bay. He had three tackles in Week 1 against the Detroit Lions.</p><p>Green Bay entered the locker room with a 14-3 lead over the Commanders. </p><p>The Packers got the scoring started with a touchdown pass from Jordan Love to wide receiver Romeo Doubs to start the scoring.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Vice President JD Vance walked alongside the casket of Charlie Kirk on Thursday evening, marking the beginning of a series of solemn tributes to the conservative figure.</p><p>Escorted across the tarmac in Salt Lake City, Utah, by a military pallbearer detail, Kirk’s casket will travel aboard Air Force Two, returning him to his home state of Arizona. A video of the moment showed his wife Erika Frantzve visibly emotional as the casket passed before her.</p><p>Upon arriving in Phoenix, Frantzve deplaned Air Force Two while holding the hand of second lady Usha Vance. His casket was transported to Hansen Memorial Chapel. Kirk will be buried in Arizona and President Donald Trump said he will attend the funeral.</p><p>Trump told reporters on Thursday evening that he believed that Kirk's funeral would be held "next weekend" adding that he would attend.</p><p>The revelation comes as federal authorities continue to search for the suspect that assassinated Kirk during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>Wednesday's event, the first in what was supposed to be a series Turning Point USA's "American Comeback Tour," was nothing out of the ordinary. Kirk, the charismatic founder of the nation’s conservative youth activist group, gained recognition for his signature political debates on college campuses. </p><p>During a press conference on Thursday, authorities say the suspect "blended in well with a college institution." In a photo later released by law enforcement, the individual is seen wearing a hat, sunglasses, and an American flag T-shirt with an eagle on it. </p><p>The FBI appealed for more public tips, photos, and videos to help piece together the string of events that led to Kirk's death. </p><p>"We truly rely on the public's help in these types of cases.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>CNBC host Joe Kernen said on Thursday that President Donald Trump told him he believed conservative activist Charlie Kirk would’ve been president someday.</p><p>During the latest episode of CNBC’s "Squawk Box" – which celebrated its 30th anniversary on Thursday – Kernen revealed that Trump called him to congratulate him on the show’s three decades on-air. During the call, the host noted that Trump praised Kirk, who was assassinated on Wednesday.</p><p>"He’s devastated about Charlie Kirk and said that, ‘What a guy, what a great individual,’ and he said he helped him greatly in the last election and thinks that Charlie Kirk could have been president someday, he was such a talented guy."</p><p>Kirk was shot and killed Wednesday during the opening event of his "The American Comeback Tour," held at Utah Valley University. He was speaking from a "Prove Me Wrong" table when he was assassinated in front of thousands of audience members, many of them college students. </p><p>The FBI announced Thursday that they have recovered the high-powered bolt action rifle believed to be the firearm used to assassinate Kirk. The suspect is still at large.</p><p>The tragic shooting prompted an outpouring of grief and condolences from conservative figures – many of them Charlie’s personal friends – as well as U.S. lawmakers, and world leaders. </p><p>Trump made a statement from the Oval Office Wednesday condemning the assassination. </p><p>"Charlie inspired millions, and tonight all who knew him and loved him are united in shock and horror," he said. "He was a patriot who devoted his life to the cause of open debate and the country that he loved so much — the United States of America. He fought for liberty, democracy, justice and the American people. He’s a martyr for truth and freedom, and there’s never been anyone who was so respected by youth."</p><p>Kernen mentioned that Trump told him the nation would heal following Kirk’s murder. </p><p>"Then he went on to say the country will heal. He’s focused on what he has been focused on, and he says, ‘I’m focused on winning, if the country wins and if I do everything I can to help the country win, that we’re all going to be able to come together again,’" he said. </p><p>Kernen also relayed Trump’s praise for "Squawk Box."</p><p>"President Trump actually called in, and I figured I’d take that call. ‘Happy anniversary. Happy 30 years.’ He loves what we do. Yeah, loves what we do every morning."</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Video from one witness to the assassination of Charlie Kirk shows people dropping to the ground as the Turning Point USA founder was shot at a speaking event on Wednesday.</p><p>Kirk was shot during an event on Wednesday hosted by TPUSA at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. A university spokesperson previously told Fox News Digital that Kirk was taken to a local hospital in critical condition, but later died.</p><p>Two separate individuals were detained and questioned by law enforcement and were later released. The FBI released two images of a person of interest on Thursday, which depict a male wearing jeans, a black shirt with an American flag graphic, a hat and black sunglasses. A $100,000 reward is offered for information leading authorities to a suspect.</p><p>"The FBI is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the identification and arrest of the individual(s) responsible for the murder of Charlie Kirk on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah," FBI Salt Lake City wrote on X.</p><p>Lexi Langley, a recent graduate of Brigham Young University, told Fox News Digital people immediately dropped to the ground after the shot was fired.</p><p>"I didn't know that he had been shot at the time. And everyone kind of dropped to the ground," Langley said. "I was preparing to hear more shots because I thought maybe this was a mass shooting. It didn't cross my mind that it would have been an assassination attempt."</p><p>Video Langley shared with Fox News Digital shows almost every individual at the UVU courtyard immediately dropping to the ground once Kirk was shot.</p><p>Langley said she ran into a building with others and that's when she realized what had happened.</p><p>"It still didn't really feel real. Like I felt like I was in a dream. It was so weird," she said. "So many people were coming through crying…it’s like the worst way to bond with strangers.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Members of the European Parliament dramatically refused a request to honor Charlie Kirk with a a moment of silence in the chamber Thursday.</p><p>Kirk, 31, was killed Wednesday as he addressed students at Utah Valley University, sending shock waves across the nation.</p><p>Kirk was known for mobilizing young conservatives and was appearing on college campuses with Turning Point USA. President Donald Trump called him "the best of America." </p><p>Over at the EU, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni described the attack on Kirk when he was shot dead as "a deep wound for democracy."</p><p>Swedish MEP Charlie Weimers of the European Conservatives and Reformists group, asked colleagues Thursday to pause proceedings in the house and to "declare that our right to freedom of speech cannot be extinguished." </p><p>Weimer's wish was supported by members of Germany’s AfD and France’s Identity Liberties movement.</p><p>But European Parliament President Roberta Metsola denied the request and said procedural rules requiring tributes had to be formally submitted at the opening of a plenary session. </p><p>Since that session had already taken place on Monday, Metsola noted a tribute could still be scheduled for October.</p><p>When Weimers went on to give up his remaining speaking time for a moment of silence, Vice President Katarina Barley cut him off, sparking desk-banging protests from right-wing lawmakers in the chamber. </p><p>"We have discussed this, and you know the president said no to a minute of silence," Barley said as centrist and left-leaning members clapped.</p><p>Outside the chamber, Hungarian Fidesz MEP András László accused Parliament of hypocrisy, pointing out it had previously honored George Floyd but refused Kirk. </p><p>Online, some lawmakers also posted, "I am Charlie" images, showing the slogan from the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack.</p><p>Metsola defended the decision as consistent with parliamentary procedure and offered condolences.</p><p>"Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife and young children — who were the bedrock of his life," she said.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Grant Delpit turned heads during the 2024 NFL season when his strong tackle knocked 252-pound running back Derrick Henry to the turf.</p><p>Roughly one year later, the Cleveland Browns defensive back delivered another hit to the Baltimore Ravens star.</p><p>As the latest Browns-Ravens matchup drew near, Delpit appeared to fan the flames of the AFC North Division rivalry when he downplayed the idea that players on opposing teams encounter difficulty in tackling Henry.</p><p>"Not hard," Delpit said when asked about the level of difficulty trying to bring Henry to the ground.</p><p>Henry caught wind of Delpit's remarks and offered a rebuttal. </p><p>"He had a quote," Henry said. "We'll see on Sunday." </p><p>The Ravens are scheduled to host the Browns Sunday. Both teams lost their season openers. Henry finished the 41-40 loss to the Buffalo Bills with 169 rushing yards.</p><p>During a game in October, Delpit and fellow Browns defensive back Denzel Ward teamed up for a noticeably big hit on Henry. Moments after the tackle, Delpit began performing the "too small" celebration.</p><p>Henry spent the first eight years of his NFL career with the Tennessee Titans. He signed with the Ravens in 2024. Henry has been relatively contained when he's faced the Browns in recent years. The five-time Pro Bowler has only surpassed the 75-yard rushing mark in one of the three games he's played against the Browns.</p><p>The trash talk leading up to Sunday's AFC North showdown has not been exclusive to Delpit. Browns wide receiver Jerry Jeudy seemed to discount the Ravens' secondary despite the group being comprised of multiple first-round draft picks. </p><p>Bills quarterback Josh Allen had success against Baltimore's pass defenders, throwing for 394 yards in Week 1. Jeudy suggested the Ravens present "no challenges." Jeudy has never recorded a touchdown catch in a game against the Ravens.</p><p>Ravens safety Kyle Hamilton shrugged off Jeudy’s comments, describing them as "bulletin board material."</p><p>"That's the thing with bulletin board material that I never understood," Hamilton said. "Was I not going to play hard before he said that? If you need bulletin board material to go play ... that's a problem with you."</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The NFL held a moment of silent reflection before the Green Bay Packers–Washington Commanders "Thursday Night Football" game for Charlie Kirk after his assassination at Utah Valley University Wednesday.</p><p>Millions showed support for Kirk's family, including the NFL, before kickoff Thursday night at Lambeau Field.</p><p>"The National Football League asks that you please join us in a silent reflection following the murder of Charlie Kirk. The NFL condemns all violence in our communities. It will take all of us to stop hate," Lambeau's public address announcer said.</p><p>Many in the NFL world reacted with mourning and devastation to the news Kirk was shot, including former quarterback Tim Tebow.</p><p>"Evil is real. There is no doubt, the enemy is hard at work," Tebow wrote on X. "These last few days, the weight of evil has been heavy across our nation. But this I know: It will not have the final word. One day, God will make all things right.</p><p>"Until then, we pray. We weep with those who weep. And we keep fighting, knowing the victory has already been won."</p><p>Ex-NFL punter Pat McAfee also shared his thoughts on X, calling the shooting "startling."</p><p>"I’m not a political person, but I am a proud American citizen and today was startling, saddening, and maddening all at the same time..," McAfee wrote on X. "I’ve realized that I’m a bit naive to how crazy it all has become but watching a man get hunted and slayed in broad daylight because of his opinions made me disgusted and devastated.</p><p>"This can’t be what we actually are or become as a country.. I believe that the good people will always outnumber the evil people but damn… today was an alarming day in our country’s history."</p><p>McAfee also spoke about Kirk during his Thursday edition of ESPN's "The Pat McAfee Show," where he reasserted that he is not someone focused on the political space, but he couldn’t help questioning the shooting.</p><p>"Yesterday, whenever we see a public execution of this man happen in all of the palms of our hands in real time … you can't help but wonder … first of all, he has family, he has kids. But, also, are we a society that's really going to become that? Is that who we are? Is that what we're going to be? Just strictly because we think that we're better than the other side? It's become a wild time, I think, in our existence. Hopefully, yesterday was a pivotal moment for us on this Sept. 11, 2025, to maybe have a Sept. 12, 2001, moment."</p><p>From Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker to former NFL receivers Julian Edelman, Antonio Brown and Golden Tate, the reactions were abundant from the football community.</p><p>President Donald Trump confirmed that Kirk will be posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p><p>Kirk is survived by his wife, Erika, and their two children.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>On the 24th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, members of Congress on both sides of the political aisle expressed that they are most worried about rising domestic terrorism harming Americans.</p><p>Asked whether he was more concerned about domestic or foreign terrorists, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told Fox News Digital, "You’ve got to be vigilant on all of it."</p><p>Yet, in the wake of the assassination of conservative leader Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, Burchett placed particular blame on the left, saying, "They’ve got blood on their hands on this one, there is no question.</p><p>"The repercussions, I think, could be monumental at the ballot box."</p><p>Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, responded that "we need a country that respects the rule of law and can actually engage in civil discourse. We don't have that right now. That's a problem.</p><p>"We have threats from all around, overseas and here, but you know we got to start respecting the rule of law again, or we're not going to have anything left."</p><p>In the current climate, Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, responded, "I think domestic. It's not a matter of if but when.</p><p>"You can't let your guard down on either," added Arrington. "I was in the White House on 9/11 with George W. Bush."</p><p>Arrington expressed particular concern about terrorists who were let into the country through the border.</p><p>"You also can't allow your border to be wide open where you have people, record numbers of people, on the terrorist watch list over here," he said.</p><p>Another Texas Republican, Rep. Troy Nehls, said he is worried about terrorists let into the country by the Biden administration.</p><p>"What we have seen with all the terrorism, with the individuals coming across our southern border for the past four years and preying on innocent victims in our country, killing Laken Riley and everyone else. I mean, these individuals coming over here, Tren de Aragua, I consider those terrorists, right? Coming over here and causing harm and impact."</p><p>Like Roy, Nehls lamented violence by "American people against American people with a dissenting point of view."</p><p>"We can't have a casual conversation and agree to disagree. We're going to start raising our fists or start pointing guns and start shooting people," said Nehls. "It's gone too far."</p><p>Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said that though the international terrorist threat is "still there," he believes "we do have an increased domestic problem because we've lost our moorings a little bit spiritually.</p><p>"A lot of folks don’t have hope or purpose, a spiritual hope or purpose. And then you have all this demonization, and people get caught up in it. You get caught up in your own little websites. Social media, your own cable, and then these guys feed on anger."</p><p>Democrats, too, said they are worried about domestic terrorism threats.</p><p>"Domestic terrorism keeps me up at night," said Rep. André Carson, D-Ind. </p><p>"I want to work with my Republican colleagues and the law enforcement community and activists and people of goodwill in keeping our community safe."</p><p>Rep. Ritchie Torres, R-N.Y., said, "I worry in the age of social media. I think we're witnessing the rise of violent extremism and domestic terrorism both at home and abroad."</p><p>Torres added that "the safety of public figures can no longer be taken for granted."</p><p>"I have lost an incentive to do public events without extensive safety precautions," he shared. "I suspect that anxiety is weighing heavily on every member of Congress."</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>ESPN host Stephen A. Smith spoke out against anyone openly celebrating the assassination of Charlie Kirk. </p><p>During an episode of his podcast Thursday, Smith aggressively condemned anyone celebrating Kirk's killing. </p><p>"I don't care what his political beliefs were. I don't care what he felt," Smith said, adding that he felt pain for Kirk and his family. </p><p>"That he's dead at the age of 31. That his wife is a widow. That his children are fatherless because his ideas and his beliefs differed from somebody else, apparently."</p><p>"And then I’m going online, and I’m seeing people celebrating it!" he continued. "Shame! Shame on you!"</p><p>Smith also commended the New York Yankees for honoring Kirk Wednesday night ahead of a game against the Detroit Tigers. The Yankees held a moment of silence for Kirk and displayed an image of him on the stadium jumbotron. </p><p>"Props to the New York Yankees organization last night for having a moment of silence," Smith said. "We're not supposed to condone stuff like this. We're not supposed to say it's OK. I don't give a damn who you are, Black, White or anything in between!</p><p>"I hope the FBI and law enforcement catch this individual and do what needs to be done with him."</p><p>A transgender Team USA BMX cyclist made a series of social media posts Wednesday celebrating the assassination. Chelsea Wolfe, who was present for the U.S. women's BMX team at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 as an alternate, made the celebratory posts on the athlete's Instagram story.</p><p>Consequences have befallen others who have made controversial comments in the aftermath of Kirk's death. </p><p>MSNBC fired political analyst Matthew Dowd for suggesting "hateful" rhetoric from Kirk led to his own assassination, Fox News Digital previously reported. </p><p>The Carolina Panthers fired Charlie Rock, a member of the team’s communications department, after social media posts linked to Rock appeared to show him questioning why people were sad that Kirk had been shot and killed. </p><p>The song "Protect Ya Neck" from the Wu-Tang Clan was also shared.</p><p>"The views expressed by our employees are their own and do not represent those of the Carolina Panthers," the team said in a statement posted to social media. "We do not condone violence of any kind. We are taking this matter very seriously and have accordingly addressed it with the individual."</p><p>Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, was struck by a single bullet around 12:20 p.m. on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem Wednesday.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>NFL legend Rob Gronkowski thinks the fall of the Kansas City Chiefs from the upper echelon of the league is upon us.</p><p>Gronkowski knows a thing or two about winning Super Bowls. He won four of them during his career. But he thinks the Philadelphia Eagles cracked the code teams had been trying to figure out for years when it comes to beating this Patrick Mahomes-led squad.</p><p>After the Eagles' 40-22 victory in the 2025 Super Bowl in New Orleans, Gronkowski gave his take.</p><p>"The Philadelphia Eagles opened that floodgate of, ‘Hey, if you punch these guys in the face, you take it to them, you come out swinging, they’re gonna fold, and they’re not gonna be the team you were seeing all last year,’" Gronkowski said on "Up &amp; Adams."</p><p>The Chiefs have now lost back-to-back games when you include February’s loss in the Super Bowl, after they fell to their AFC West rival, the Los Angeles Chargers, in São Paulo, Brazil, to kick off the 2025 season. Justin Herbert had one of the best games of his career, and the Chargers won 27-21.</p><p>While Herbert was carving up the Chiefs’ defense, there was a moment captured of Chiefs defensive lineman Chris Jones getting into it with fellow defensive star Drue Tranquill during a timeout on the sideline.</p><p>Gronkowski made that a point of emphasis in his argument.</p><p>"What I was surprised about is when things aren’t going their way, as you can see, when they start struggling a little bit, they start yelling at each other," he explained. "The blame game starts going on. You can see it on the sidelines. And that’s not a good situation. You want to come together when you’re down, when things aren’t going your way.</p><p>"To see them starting to point fingers is not a good sign."</p><p>The Chiefs do have a revenge opportunity this Sunday in their home opener. The Eagles travel to Arrowhead Stadium for a Super Bowl rematch in FOX’s "America’s Game of the Week."</p><p>Philadelphia handled the Dallas Cowboys in its season opener, 24-20, as Jalen Hurts rushed for two touchdowns, while the 2024 Offensive Player of the Year, Saquon Barkley, added his first score of the campaign.</p><p>The Eagles knew what to do with Mahomes and company back in February, so it will be interesting to see how head coach Andy Reid and the rest of his coaching staff scheme against Philadelphia this time around.</p><p></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Columbia University's student-run satirical newspaper, The Federalist, published an article on Wednesday roasting Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk in the wake of his assassination because of his support for gun rights.</p><p>The article, published just hours after Kirk's death, satirized the staunch Second Amendment advocate being shot and killed, with the headline, "Turning Point USA Undergoes Unexpected Ideological Shift, States Second Amendment Actually Not That Important Anymore."</p><p>"'The Turning Point USA leadership team recently convened to discuss the role of the Second Amendment in our propaganda, I mean, education. We’ve decided to reconsider our stance on gun control and personal freedoms. This decision was made completely independently of recent events,'" the mock statement written by the satire site read.</p><p>"'Guns kill people. That is a truth that we have only recently learned. It turns out, ignoring all of those public health experts and grieving parents and nationwide statistics wasn’t a good idea. Our bad!'" </p><p>The short article continued, slamming both the Turning Point USA organization and conservatives at large for their "terrible politics."</p><p>"In typical conservative fashion, it seems, Turning Point USA only realizes how terrible their politics are when it f---s with their own lives. Go figure," the outlet concluded.</p><p>Kirk, a husband and father of two, was shot and killed during a campus event at Utah Valley University Wednesday. He was 31.</p><p>Kirk was shot in the neck as he spoke to the large crowd from under a white pop-up tent. He was rushed to the hospital and pronounced dead later Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>Kirk's shocking death has been met with widespread mourning and outrage. President Donald Trump, who counted Kirk as a friend and close political ally, called him a patriot and man of deep faith.</p><p>"An assassin tried to silence him with a bullet, but he failed, because together, we will ensure that his voice, his message and his legacy will live on for countless generations to come," Trump said Wednesday from the Oval Office.</p><p>As of Thursday morning, Kirk's killer remains at large.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to The Columbia Federalist for comment. The satirical paper was co-founded by future Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a student in 1986.</p><p>Kirk frequently defended the Second Amendment as a necessary means to "defend yourself against a tyrannical government." Some of his ideological foes noted he said some gun deaths were an unfortunate and unavoidable consequence, so "we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights."</p><p><i>Editor's Note: This article previously stated below the headline that the publication was the "Columbia Spectator."

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>OREM, Utah — Utah State Police blocked the perimeter of the Losee Center at Utah Valley University Thursday morning as the manhunt continues for the assassin of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. </p><p>Authorities confirmed Wednesday the shot that killed Kirk came from the roof of a campus building about 200 yards away from where Kirk was delivering his remarks. </p><p>While authorities have not confirmed the shots came from the Losee Center Wednesday, state police cars blocked incoming traffic outside the Losee Center Thursday as authorities investigated in and around the school building. </p><p>Videos captured by eyewitnesses Wednesday showed a person in dark clothing running on a campus building. </p><p>"We have tracked his movements onto the campus through the stairwells, up to the roof, across the roof to a shooting location," Beau Mason, Utah Department of Public Safety commissioner, told reporters Thursday. </p><p>"After the shooting, we were able to track his movements as he moved to the other side of the building, jumped off of the building and fled off of the campus and into a neighborhood," Mason added. </p><p>Mason said authorities have "good video footage" of the shooter on the roof where shots were fired they are using to identify the suspect. </p><p>According to UVU's website, the campus is closed until Monday, Sept. 15. While students have been advised to stay away from campus, media and law enforcement have remained on campus with the investigation still underway.</p><p>Journalists were allowed to drive through campus on Thursday. However, there were several Utah State Police vehicles parked outside the Losee Center, marking a perimeter where authorities said the investigation was ongoing. </p><p>State troopers did not provide a timeline for when the building would reopen to the media. </p><p>"Items left in the Courtyard and Losee Center are not available to be picked up at this time due to the investigation," according to the message on the school's website. </p><p>Losee Center for Student Success, known as the Losee Center orLC" for short, is a student resource center. Students can seek personal and professional guidance at the center from school specialists, coordinators and other counselors, according to UVU's website. </p><p>Utah's Department of Public Safety indicated Thursday afternoon that the investigation is "fast-moving and constantly evolving."</p><p>According to the latest media advisory, as of Thursday afternoon, law enforcement is investigating multiple leads, but no suspect is in custody. </p><p>"A high-powered bolt-action rifle was recovered in a wooded area where the shooter had fled. Experts from the FBI are analyzing the weapon. There are reportedly photos of a weapon and various details about that firearm and ammunition, including inscriptions and symbols," the department shared, painting a picture of the suspected shooter's escape route. </p><p>Investigators have also collected a footwear impression, a palm print and forearm imprints for analysis, according to the media release. </p><p>Mason told reporters Thursday morning investigators have searched nearby neighborhoods, "contacting anybody they can with doorbell cameras, witnesses and thoroughly worked through those communities, trying to identify any leads."</p><p>The FBI is offering up to a $100,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's identification and arrest. </p><p>Earlier on Thursday, authorities canceled a press conference scheduled for 12:45 p.m. MT, citing "rapid developments in our investigation."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Podcast host Joe Rogan praised slain TPUSA co-founder Charlie Kirk, arguing he deserves credit for trying to protect Americans' ability to have an open debate. </p><p>"There's going to be a lot of people celebrating this," Rogan told guest Charlie Sheen. "It's so scary. It's so dangerous too, to celebrate or to in any way encourage this kind of behavior from human beings. … He's not a violent guy. He was talking to people on college campuses."</p><p>He added that Kirk "wasn't even particularly rude. He tried to be pretty reasonable with people."</p><p>"Everything I saw seemed reasonable," Sheen replied.</p><p>Kirk, the founder of one of the most influential political organizations in the country, was shot while holding an event on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. He later died, leaving the country reeling from another act of horrific political violence.</p><p>The suspect remains at large. Authorities said they recovered a high-powered bolt-action rifle and obtained clear video of the shooter, who reportedly jumped from a building and ran off campus into a nearby neighborhood.</p><p>Rogan, who still touts himself as a liberal at heart, was aghast at Kirk’s death. He suggested Kirk was "murdered for having a different opinion from somebody else, different ideology from somebody else."</p><p>"He was a very intelligent guy," Rogan said. "Whether you agree with him or don't, and there's a lot of stuff that I didn't agree with him on. That's fine. You're allowed to disagree with people without celebrating the fact they got shot."</p><p>Rogan offered his vision of how political opponents should actually interact in American life.</p><p>"Well, what you're supposed to do with a guy like that, if you're opposing him is debate him, right?" Rogan said. "Have a conversation where your argument is more compelling than his. That's what people should be celebrating — discourse. You know, we used to do that."</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump arrived at Yankee Stadium Thursday and spoke to members of the New York Yankees ahead of their 9/11 anniversary game against the Detroit Tigers.</p><p>Trump landed in New York shortly after 6 p.m. A couple of hours earlier, Yankees manager Aaron Boone said, Trump was meeting with the team in the clubhouse before the game.</p><p>Trump went into the locker room about 30 minutes before the game started, calling the Steinbrenners a "great family."</p><p></p><p>"It’s a great family. [Team president] Randy [Levine] is wonderful, and I will say, you’re gonna win. George used to for some reason. I don’t know what it was, we won every time I came. Every time I came, we’d win a game. If you think that was easy, sitting with him for a game, it wasn’t. It was brutal. We were exhausted at the end. But we won, and you’re going to win. You’re gonna go all the way. Can you get in the playoff? I think. How about tonight? We start tonight, and you’re gonna do well.</p><p>"Randy was telling me the Boston Red Sox came to the Oval Office. They wanted to come. What am I gonna do? Say no? And they won 15 games in a row. I just want to wish you guys a lot of luck. You’re great players. I know every one of you."</p><p>Trump then shook hands with everyone in the clubhouse, joking that he wished Aaron Judge was "a little bit bigger." </p><p>"If you have that much muscle, you have to hit the ball further," Trump said. "You’re a fantastic player."</p><p>Trump arrived at his suite shortly before 7 p.m. to initially a mixed ovation, but the majority of it was cheers. Large U-S-A chants eventually rang out, however. He did not take part in the pregame 9/11 ceremonies but was the first person shown on the big screen during the national anthem. Trump saluted and again received mostly cheers, while some boos could be heard.</p><p>Yankees manager Aaron Boone said he was "excited" about Trump's presence.</p><p>"Had the honor and fortune of some presidents over the years, first pitches or whatever it may be. So, the fact that he’s gonna be here, I’m excited to be a part of. I don’t know what it’ll be like, but to interact with him for a few minutes, something I’m looking forward to," Boone said.</p><p>Thursday marked the first time Trump attended a Major League Baseball game since the 2021 World Series between the Houston Astros and Atlanta Braves after his presidential term. Prior to Thursday, his last game as a sitting president was during the 2019 World Series between the Astros and Washington Nationals.</p><p>Trump announced earlier this month he would attend the game. The Yankees announced it Wednesday and urged fans to arrive early and take public transportation. Gates opened at 4 p.m. ET, 90 minutes earlier than normal.</p><p>Prior to Trump's arrival, the Yankees' scoreboard showed highlights of the 2001 World Series between the Yankees and Arizona Diamondbacks. The Diamondbacks won the series in seven games, but the Yankees' victories in Games 4 and 5 both ended in dramatic walk-offs, less than two months after the Sept. 11 attacks.</p><p>Already guaranteed to have a heightened presence after Charlie Kirk's assassination, security was boosted throughout the ballpark with the Secret Service and sniffer dogs outside the gates.</p><p>Boone, Gerrit Cole and Carlos Rodon laid a wreath at the 9/11 monument in Monument Park earlier Thursday.</p><p>Next season, the Yankees and New York Mets will face off at Yankee Stadium on the 25th anniversary of the attacks.

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Chicago-area mayor and congressional candidate stood by his actions to thwart even passive cooperation with federal immigration enforcement operations as DHS launches "Operation Midway Blitz" in the area.</p><p>Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, a Democrat who is running to succeed retiring Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., in 2026, told CNN he is "in the dark" as to DHS’ plans for Illinois in the coming days.</p><p>He also said he informed residents Tuesday about his concerns and what actions he took in response.</p><p>"The Trump administration wants to keep us guessing, wants to use our uncertainty to keep us afraid, but the reason that we communicated with our residents this morning is that I got information from a senior state official last night indicating that they had good intel that it was likely that ICE would be coming to Evanston in today and in the coming days."</p><p>Biss said he did so for residents to "protect themselves" from federal law enforcement.</p><p>"We've been doing everything we can to protect our residents from before Donald Trump took office, passing strong sanctuary laws to make sure police are not cooperating with federal civil immigration enforcement," he added.</p><p>Biss explained he ordered Evanston’s license plate cameras turned off after learning the data was being shared. </p><p>Unlike red light cameras, which issue tickets, license plate readers are often used to collect and store vehicle data for later retrieval. </p><p>In some cases, state or federal law enforcement might use the data to track a suspect’s known vehicle, finding that it navigated a certain interchange at a specific time.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Biss for further comment but did not hear back by press time.</p><p>In a separate video Biss recorded while leaving a Mexican Independence Day parade in Chicago, he said he used his "rapid response training to keep an eye out for potential ICE personnel" during the event and "if possible, keep people safe from attack."</p><p>"My responsibility was to see which masked individual might, with no warning, just grab people off the street [or] which uniformed personnel might, without warning, attack our people."</p><p>"We're going to remember for a long time what we did in this moment.

But, at the time of the attacks, he was with the Cincinnati Reds. However, the sport of baseball played a vital role in bringing normalcy back.</p><p>"Making sense of it and what it all meant, and now with my connection to the Yankees and knowing what the Yankees, the Mets and really baseball overall, the role that our sport played in whatever it was. Healing, normalcy, something. To see that postseason live out and watching it from afar was very meaningful. And then the sobering reflection of today of the lives lost, the heroic things that took place on that day by so many. So, it’s always a sobering day, a day of reflection, but also a day of as a sport, there’s some pride in the role our sport played in that time," Boone said.</p><p>Before the gates opened, Boone and pitchers Gerrit Cole and Carlos Rodon laid a wreath at the 9/11 monument in Monument Park.</p><p>"Really meaningful. I’ve gotten to do that a few times when we’ve been here.

"This is an ongoing situation, and we will provide updates as they become available.""Naval Support Activity Annapolis, in coordination with local law enforcement, is currently responding to reports of threats made to the Naval Academy," NSAA PAO, Lt. Naweed Lemar, told Fox News. "The base is on lockdown out of an abundance of caution. This is a developing situation, and we will provide updates as they become available."A Defense Department official also confirmed the agency is aware of the lockdown at the campus, adding officials "are monitoring the situation with the Navy. Secretary Hegseth has been briefed."</p><p>Separately, a message circulating among midshipmen and attributed to the Commandant which Fox News has not independently verified states the initial threat began on the anonymous chat platform Yodel and was traced to a separated midshipman who was later confirmed to be at his parents’ home in the Midwest. </p><p>That message also said the midshipman injured today mistook security forces for an intruder and that the incident was part of a wave of false active-shooter reports across the country. The Commandant’s message warned that ‘misinformation was the biggest threat today.’A former student also told Fox News Digital how "horrible" it must feel for the midshipman locked inside since the building always felt like "home" and houses around 4000 or more individuals.</p><p>"It's definitely obviously horrible because the school is very close. The common phrase that you'll hear midshipmen describe Bancroft Hall is that you live and work there," the former student said."So, it's, it's both your home and your workplace," the former student added before describing how secure the hall is. "There's really two main security checkpoints manned 24/7, by armed guards.</p><p>"The only form of security is CAC readers, so, theoretically, you can't get in unless you have a CAC or someone just like leaves the door open."Officials said a final sweep of the yard is underway and the lockdown will lift shortly.</p><p><i>This is a developing story.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Charlie Kirk warned ‘assassination culture is spreading on the left’ in eerie online post months before murder</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Several months prior to Wednesday's tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, the slain 31-year-old conservative activist warned his followers on social media that "assassination culture is spreading on the left."</p><p>Kirk shared a post April 7 on X.com that cited a Fox News Digital article about a nationally representative study from the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) that found 38% of respondents said it would be at least "somewhat justified" to murder President Donald Trump, and 31% said the same about Elon Musk. But the numbers jump even higher, to 55% for Trump and 48% for Musk, when counting just the left-leaning survey respondents.</p><p>"Assassination culture is spreading on the left. Forty-eight percent of liberals say it would be at least somewhat justified to murder Elon Musk. Fifty-five percent said the same about Donald Trump," Kirk wrote in his post on X, citing the NCRI report. </p><p>"The left is being whipped into a violent frenzy. Any setback, whether losing an election or losing a court case, justifies a maximally violent response."</p><p>Kirk called the violent momentum a "natural outgrowth of left-wing protest culture." He accused the culture of tolerating "violence and mayhem," while also slamming "the cowardice" of local prosecutors and school officials for their complicity in promoting the trend of violent attitudes.</p><p>"The cowardice of local prosecutors and school officials have turned the left into a ticking time bomb," Kirk wrote in his post.</p><p>In Kirk's post, he also pointed to the fact that voters in California were effectively eulogizing United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson's murderer Luigi Mangione by naming a state ballot measure after him. It was called the Luigi Mangione Access to Health Care Act, which sought to make it more difficult for medical insurance companies to deny claims for treatments or medications.  </p><p>Wednesday's assassination of Kirk, who founded the grassroots conservative advocacy group Turning Point USA in 2012, is just the latest incident of conservative figures and institutions being targeted with violence. The fatal shooting comes amid a record over the past four years of conservatives and Republicans encountering violence, a Fox News Digital review found, including two assassination attempts on Trump within about a two-month period in 2024.</p><p>Earlier this year, the New Mexico Republican Party's headquarters faced an arson attack that destroyed the entrance to its Albuquerque headquarters, and graffiti that said "ICE=KKK" was scrawled on the building. The suspect in that case also allegedly attacked a Tesla Albuquerque showroom and was hit with federal charges.</p><p>The spate of violent incidents at the beginning of this year targeting Tesla car owners, dealerships, charging stations and Republicans in general compelled some GOP lawmakers to cancel public events. GOP Wyoming Rep. Harriet Hageman was one of those lawmakers. Her decision came after an incident in which an attendee of one of her town halls followed Hageman as she left and initiated a physical confrontation with her staff, eventually requiring police to intervene.</p><p>A handful of pro-life activists were also physically attacked this year, including a pro-life journalist who was punched by an interviewee mid-discussion. </p><p>TPUSA chapters around the nation have faced other incidents of violence this year as well, including when a group of students with Turning Point USA were attacked by masked individuals at University of California, Davis in April, Fox News previously reported. The conservative group was hosting one of its frequently held Prove Me Wrong events on the campus when protesters destroyed camera gear, a tentand signs at the event. They also flipped tables and assaulted TPUSA staff, the group said after the incident happened. </p><p>Going back to 2023, former NCAA swimmer and conservative political activist Riley Gaines was attacked and barricaded by protesters in a room at San Francisco State University after she went to campus to speak to students about banning biological males who identify as transgender from competing in women's sports. The event was part of a Turning Point USA and Leadership Institute forum that was taking place on the university's campus.</p><p>Meanwhile, churches and pro-life groups have faced dozens upon dozens of attacks dating back to 2022 after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organizationdecision, which effectively ended the recognition of abortion as a constitutional right. </p><p>The attacks included a "firebombed" pro-life center in Buffalo, New York, in 2022, vandalized Catholic churches that were targets of arson attacks and pro-choice protesters interrupting faith services. The attacks came after a far-left pro-choice group declared in a public letter that it was "open season" on pro-lifers.</p><p>Notably, in 2017, then-House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., was shot along with three others when James Hodgkinson, a deranged Bernie Sanders supporter, fired upon an Alexandria, Virginia, baseball field as Republican lawmakers practiced for the annual Congressional Baseball Game. Scalise, who nearly died but ultimately recovered, remains in office and is the House Majority Leader for the Republicans.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Leftist Wikipedia editors twist facts in shameless move to smear Charlie Kirk</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>In the aftermath of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, America is searching for answers. But on Wikipedia, a different kind of search is underway. Editors on the site are pushing a left-wing narrative about Kirk, one that’s subtle but — for that precise reason — highly effective.</p><p>The attack on Kirk begins in the very first sentence of the Wikipedia article, which identifies him as "right-wing." That may seem unobjectionable in itself, but a look at Wikipedia articles on comparable figures from the left reveals no such politicized framing. </p><p>For example, the article on former Obama advisor David Plouffe identifies him as an "American political and business strategist," and MSNBC host and political analyst Al Sharpton is described as an "American civil rights and social justice activist." Although the articles do describe their partisan activities, they aren't called liberal or leftist in them at all. Plouffe was even "invited to join" ACRONYM, "a liberal nonprofit." But he’s not called "liberal."</p><p>The attack continues further down in the Kirk article’s lead paragraphs, where editors said Kirk was controversial due to his "opposition to gun control, abortion, and LGBTQ rights; his criticism of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Martin Luther King Jr.; and his promotion of Christian nationalism, COVID-19 misinformation, the Great Replacement conspiracy theory, and false claims of electoral fraud in 2020."</p><p>The framing ensures that anyone searching for Kirk after his murder is met with a narrative designed to discredit him.</p><p>Even more critically, the lede disproportionately feeds Google’s knowledge panel and search results and top AI platforms. I asked ChatGPT, "Did Charlie Kirk promote conspiracy theories?" It answered, "Yes, Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist and founder of Turning Point USA, actively promoted several conspiracy theories throughout his career." To support this, ChatGPT cites five "conspiracy theories" spread by Kirk, three pulled directly from the list above. In four of the five cases, ChatGPT cites only one source: Wikipedia.</p><p>One way Wikipedia editors stage an attack is by cross-linking allegations across articles. The allegation, made in the main "Charlie Kirk" article that he was a proponent of "Christian nationalism," links to a separate article that asserts this view is "noted to bear overlap with Christian fundamentalism, [W]hite supremacy, Christian supremacy, the Seven Mountain Mandate movement, and dominionism." </p><p>In a newly created article, "Killing of Charlie Kirk," editors wrote that Kirk "utilized his skills in social media and campus organizing to become a highly influential figure in the ‘hard-right movement,’" citing an article in The New York Times. </p><p>In a dedicated section in Kirk’s main article, "Promotion of falsehoods and conspiracy theories," Wikipedia editors initially accused Kirk of promoting "the antisemitic Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory." Kirk was widely known as one of the most influential supporters of American Jews in the country.</p><p>The article has since been changed to say Kirk "promoted the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory and described universities as ‘islands of totalitarianism.’" One of the articles it links to in citation is a 2019 article in the Journal of Social Justice headlined, "Who’s Afraid of the Frankfurt School? ‘Cultural Marxism’ as an Antisemitic Conspiracy Theory."</p><p>Hours after his murder, in the "Gun Control" section of the article’s Talk page, where editors debate proposed edits, one editor recommended "noting Kirk's relevance as both an opposition to gun control and as a gun control statistic." Another editor argued that a 2023 speech by Kirk — where he noted the unfortunate consequence of gun deaths while expressing his support for Second Amendment rights — "would show his willingness to accept this outcome" of his own murder. The quote from that speech remains in the Kirk article itself.</p><p>An analysis of the news sources used as references in the Charlie Kirk article shows a majority of the sources are left or left-leaning, as categorized by AllSides. These include multiple citations from The New York Times, Washington Post, Politico, The Guardian and CNN.</p><p>This bias has not gone unnoticed in Washington. In August, the House Oversight Committee opened a formal investigation into the Wikimedia Foundation, which owns and operates the site, demanding documents and records to determine whether foreign or ideological manipulation is shaping content on the world’s most influential source of online information. Naturally, the Wikimedia Foundation didn't respond to my inquiry.</p><p>At its core, Wikipedia is a wrapper for the mainstream media. Its infamous "Reliable Sources" list of news outlets that can be used as references and sources Wikipedia editors consider to be "reliable" as green and those they deem "unreliable" as red. The green sites read like a semi-official list of the mainstream media: New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, NBC News, CBS News, ABC News, Associated Press. It disproportionately marks conservative outlets as unreliable, while giving a neutral rating to the Chinese propaganda outlet China Daily.</p><p>Clearly, something at Wikipedia needs to change. But if the mainstream media that the site relies on is any indication, that’s not likely to happen any time soon. In the meantime, the site that disproportionately feeds AI and powers Google will remain a battleground where far-left ideology gets laundered into the mainstream almost unchecked.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Turning Point USA (TPUSA) founder Charlie Kirk’s longtime friend and Trump advisor Alex Bruesewitz honored his late friend’s memory Thursday on "The Story." </p><p>"It’s been a really tough 24 hours, and I lost a friend of mine since I was 16 years old," Bruesewitz told Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum.  </p><p>The two friends collaborated on Bruesewitz's book, "Winning the Social Media War," with Kirk having written the foreword. Both have worked to expand President Donald Trump’s appeal to young voters.</p><p>Bruesewitz, who is three years younger than Kirk, described him as the "nicest man" he’s ever met. </p><p>[Kirk] would never hurt anyone," Bruesewitz said. "It breaks my heart that it was him who got hurt. He only wanted to have conversations with people. He only wanted to debate people. He didn't use violence, he didn't use violent rhetoric. He just spoke the truth.<i>"</i></p><p>The political strategist went on to blast the "sick ideology" he says America is up against.</p><p>The radical left for too long has been perpetrating this hate on innocent people like the president, who got nearly shot twice," Bruesewitz argued. </p><p>He ridiculed negative coverage of Kirk, specifically from politicians who "kiss your a--" in private but "spew hate" on TV.</p><p>"These people don't even believe what they say, but they say it anyway because they want to get television hits on MSNBC or CNN," Bruesewitz argued.</p><p>"It's sick," he continued. "And every single person that has said a hateful thing about Charlie or about the president or about any of us must immediately apologize and cease from saying it further.

<div class="article-title">Fox News Poll: Trump’s ratings are strong on border security, weak on the economy</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>While President Donald Trump receives positive reviews on border security and public safety, the economy remains a weakness. Prices are a problem for most voters, as only a small number feel they are getting ahead financially, and more than half think things are worse under the new White House.</p><p>By a 22-point margin, a Fox News national survey finds that more voters say the Trump administration has made the economy worse (52%) rather than better (30%). </p><p>Those sentiments are almost identical to how they felt about the Biden administration and are the reverse of how voters felt eight years ago during Trump’s first term.</p><p>The survey was completed before Turning Point USA Founder Charlie Kirk’s assassination Wednesday.</p><p>Ratings of the economy continue to be negative by more than 2-to-1 (71% negative vs. 29% positive). That’s roughly where things stood when Trump took office.</p><p>As has been the case for more than four years, fewer than 15% say they are getting ahead financially, while at least three times that number say they are falling behind.</p><p>Yet, in some areas, voters say things are not as bad. A year ago, 48% said gas prices were a "major" problem for their families. Now 33% feel that way, down 15 points. Likewise, a smaller share says housing costs (by 11 points) and grocery prices (by 8 points) are a major problem.</p><p>It’s the opposite on utility (+2 points) and healthcare costs (+7), as more people call those a major problem.</p><p>Still, large majorities describe each of these costs as either a minor or major problem.</p><p>"The question former President Biden's team was asking a year ago was whether voters would get used to an $8 dollar box of cereal, and the answer was no," says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox News surveys with his Democratic counterpart, Chris Anderson. </p><p>"I think the Trump team is finding this dynamic still holds. It's not enough that prices aren't rising. They need to come down. If not, 2026 will be a bad year for the GOP." </p><p>Voters’ persistent negativity about the economy was at least somewhat validated by a recent Labor Department report that showed the 2024 employment estimates were much weaker than initially thought.</p><p>The economy remains by far the most important issue to voters (37%). That’s followed by immigration and border security (13%), healthcare (11%) and political division (11%). All other issues are in single digits, including crime and guns. Notably, Democrats, Republicans and independents agree the economy is the top issue facing the country.</p><p>Looking ahead, voters are pessimistic: 62% think life will be worse for the next generation of Americans. That’s up from 53% who felt that way a year ago and is the second highest in Fox News surveys going back to 2002. By a 10-point margin, optimism is higher among parents (44%) than non-parents (34%), and by a 13-point margin, more dads (50%) than moms (37%) think life will be better for their kids. Eight in 10 Democrats and independents think life will be worse, while six in 10 Republicans think it will be better. A year ago, nearly six in 10 Democrats said life would be better for the next generation, while seven in 10 Republicans and six in 10 independents said worse. </p><p>Approval of Trump on the economy stands at 39%, only one tick higher than his record low, and even fewer voters approve of his handling of tariffs (36%) and the cost of living (32%). </p><p>While Trump’s ratings are better on immigration (47% approve) and crime (50%), his best marks are on border security, as 57% approve. That’s not only a record on border security, but it’s also his second-highest approval ever on any issue in a Fox News survey (the highest was 60% for "recent hurricanes" in 2017). In addition, 49% approve of ICE, up from 46% in June.</p><p>Fewer are concerned about crime in their neighborhood: 32% are extremely or very concerned, down from 48% in 2021.</p><p>Over half approve of the federal government generally playing a role in policing crime in large cities (53%) and specifically of Trump sending National Guard troops to help the police in Washington, D.C. (51%).</p><p>Currently, 46% like the job Trump is doing overall, while 54% disapprove. His highest approval this term was 49% in March, soon after taking office. Fully 88% of Republicans approve, as do 55% of men under age 45 and 48% of Hispanics. Among all voters, a larger number strongly disapproves of Trump (45%) than strongly approves (25%). That 20-point intensity gap is mostly unchanged since March and is comparable with Biden’s ratings for most of his term. </p><p>Some 46% of voters also approve of the job Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is doing as secretary of Health and Human Services. His ratings are higher among parents (53%) and dads (57%) than non-parents (43%) and moms (49%).</p><p>Forty-nine percent approve of Jerome Powell’s performance as chair of the Federal Reserve. About half of those approving of Trump also approve of Powell, and vice versa.</p><p>Two-thirds of voters think the country has become less united since Trump took office. That’s double the number who feel he has brought people together and worse than the 54% who felt Biden was dividing the country four years ago. </p><p>Trump’s personal favorable rating is in line with his job approval: 43% view him favorably and 57% unfavorably, for a net negative of 14 points. Vice President JD Vance (-12), former Vice President Kamala Harris (-13), Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (-12), and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (-11) all have about the same net negative favorability as Trump. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker’s marks are underwater by 13 points, yet he is unknown to nearly half of voters.</p><p>Three quarters think the president should "always" follow the law, while one quarter say the U.S. is so far off track it needs a president who will "break some laws" to set things right. Those sentiments have remained unchanged since December 2023. Three times as many Republicans as Democrats think the U.S. needs a president willing to break some laws to set things right.</p><p>More voters have confidence in their local courts (66%) than in federal courts (58%) or the Supreme Court (55%). Far more Republicans (78%) have faith in the Supreme Court than independents (47%) and Democrats (34%), while majorities of all three groups have confidence in their local courts.</p><p><i>Conducted Sept. 6-9, 2025, under the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw &amp; Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,004 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file.

<div class="article-title">Search for Charlie Kirk's killer continues. Here's what we know.</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A search was continuing Thursday for the person who <span class="link">shot and killed Charlie Kirk</span> at an event at Utah Valley University. <span class="link">Kirk</span>, a prominent conservative activist who co-founded the right-wing advocacy group Turning Point USA, was 31.</p><p>Authorities have not yet identified or apprehended a suspect nor specified a motive, but on Thursday officials revealed new details about the shooter's movements, a weapon that was recovered and the investigation.</p><p>Federal law enforcement officials believe they have identified the name of a person of interest, two U.S. officials and a law enforcement source told CBS News Thursday. So far, however, no arrest warrant has been issued. </p><p>Earlier, the Utah Public Safety Department and the Salt Lake City FBI office posted two images of someone they called a "person of interest," showing an individual appearing to be wearing a dark long-sleeve shirt, and a hat and sunglasses.</p>
<p>The two agencies released several more photos Thursday evening of the person of interest, who appeared to be on a staircase and wearing a backpack. The agency did not disclose where the photos were taken. </p>
<p>Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said authorities had received more than 7,000 leads and tips from the public as of Thursday evening, and nearly 200 interviews have been conducted by investigators. </p>
<p>Officials took two people into custody Wednesday in the wake of the shooting but later said neither was tied to the shooting and both were released.  </p><p>Here is what we know so far about the ongoing investigation.  </p><h2>Suspect at large</h2><p>Authorities said the suspect remained at large Thursday and that a manhunt is ongoing to identify and capture the person responsible. </p>
<p>The FBI said it is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads law enforcement to identify and arrest the person or people involved in Kirk's assassination. </p><p>Two law enforcement sources told CBS News Thursday that U.S. Marshals were assisting the FBI in tracking down the suspected shooter. The FBI remains the lead investigating agency but is working with Utah officials. </p><p>Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said the suspect was a male who "blended in" with the college community and appears to be "college-age." </p><p>Mason said investigators have been able to track the shooter's movements <span class="link">before and after the assassination</span>. He said the gunman is believed to have arrived on campus at 11:52 a.m. local time Wednesday and moved through stairwells to the roof of a building near where Kirk's event was taking place, which was the shooting location. </p><p>Mason said the shooter moved to the other side of the building after firing a single shot, then jumped off and fled into a neighborhood off campus. Investigators contacted homeowners with cameras, and witnesses, to identify leads, he said.</p><p>In a news briefing Thursday evening in Orem with FBI Director Kash Patel in attendance, officials released new security video that shows him running across the roof and then climbing down the side of the building immediately after the shooting. </p>
<p>As he climbed off the edge of the building and dropped down, he "left some palm impressions, some smudges, some places we're looking to collect DNA," along with a shoe print that indicated he was wearing Converse tennis shoes, Mason told reporters while showing the video. </p>
<p>"It's important to note his black t-shirt, his black pants, and there appears to be some white on the soles of those Converse tennis shoes," Mason said. "Those are all identifiable items that we're looking for." </p><p>After dropping off the building, the video showed the person of interest moving across a grassy area before entering into traffic. Mason said he crossed the street into a wooded area, where the firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was later found.</p><p>Mason had previously said authorities "have good video footage" of the person of interest, which they hope will help as they work to identify him. </p><h2>Weapon recovered</h2><p>FBI special-agent-in-charge Robert Bohls said Thursday that investigators recovered a "high-powered, bolt-action rifle," which they believe was the weapon used in the assassination. It was found in a wooded area where the shooter fled and will be analyzed by the FBI, according to Bohls. </p><p>Investigators also have a footwear impression, palm print and forearm imprints that will be analyzed, the FBI official said.</p><p>The FBI's Salt Lake City field office established a tip submission form where people can share information about the shooting. The agency said it has "full resources devoted to this investigation, including tactical, operational, investigative and intelligence." It is investigating along with Utah state authorities.</p><h2>A "targeted attack"</h2><p>Kirk was struck in the neck at around 12 p.m. local time Wednesday by a single gunshot, which the perpetrator fired as Kirk addressed a large crowd at an outdoor "Prove Me Wrong" debate on Utah Valley University's campus in Orem, Utah. </p>
<p>The "Prove Me Wrong" debate is a trademark event for Kirk's Turning Point USA, a conservative organization focused on young people, where he would hold political debates with a group that usually consisted of left-leaning attendees. Kirk had visited the Utah school as part of a nationwide tour of college campuses that was scheduled to continue for the next two months. About 3,000 people attended the outdoor event, the Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement.</p><p>While authorities have not specified a potential motive for the shooting, Mason said they believe it was a "targeted attack toward one individual." Only one shot was fired, and Kirk was the only victim, according to the commissioner.</p><p>Cox called the shooting "a political assassination," while President Trump, in a video posted to Truth Social, blamed it on "radical left political violence," which he said "has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives." Mr. Trump vowed to "find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity." Kirk was a close Trump ally and was credited with galvanizing younger voters during his campaign.</p><p>On Thursday, Cox said the state plans to seek the death penalty in Kirk's murder.</p><p>"We've been working with our attorneys, getting everything that we need, affidavits ready, so that we can pursue the death penalty in this case. And that will happen here in the state of Utah," the governor told reporters at a Thursday evening press conference.</p><p>Bohls reiterated Thursday that investigators consider the shooting to be a "targeted event," and do not believe there are lingering risks to the public.</p><h2>Shooting location</h2><p>A map produced by CBS News' Confirmed team shows where Kirk was when he was shot — in the central courtyard of Utah Valley University, which is surrounded by campus buildings.</p>
<p>A university spokeswoman said Wednesday they believed the shot was fired from the Losee Center. A law enforcement source told CBS News that the gunman appeared to have fired from the building's roof.  </p><p>Video verified by CBS News shows a person running across the building's roof in the moments after the shooting, about 400 feet from where Kirk was speaking. Authorities have not confirmed whether that person is connected to the attack. Drone video captured afterward shows police tape on the roof where the person was seen.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Bohls of the FBI said investigators had received over 130 tips and that those tips and other leads were being "fully investigated."</p>

<div class="article-title">Politicians condemn killing of Charlie Kirk</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>It was President Trump who announced that conservative commentator and activist <span class="link">Charlie Kirk had died after he was shot</span> during a Turning Point USA event at <span class="link">Utah Valley University</span> on Wednesday afternoon. The president, who was close to Kirk, praised his appeal to young Americans and mourned him in a social media post.</p><p>"The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us," Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. </p><p>The president also ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff until Sunday evening to honor Kirk.</p><p>Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump released a video statement about Kirk, blaming the "radical left" for his killing. "For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals," he said in a video posted to Truth Social. "This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now."</p><p>Democratic and Republican politicians alike condemned Kirk's murder, although among some in Congress, there were disagreements about how to observe his death on the House floor. Speaker Mike Johnson attempted to hold a moment of silence for Kirk. Then, according to the House gallery, GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado asked for a point of order — she reshared an X post that said she had asked for a moment of prayer. A Democrat yelled, "No." Boebert and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, then started to speak out, as other lawmakers who appeared to be Democrats responded. One yelled, "There was just a shooting in Colorado!" Another said "Pass some gun laws!" Johnson repeatedly called for order.</p>
<p>In an appearance on Fox News, Johnson explained what had happened. "A motion was made on the floor to have a vocal prayer, and it turned into an argument," he said, adding, "You know, that's where our politics are in the country right now. We have got to turn the heat down a little bit. We got to have civil discourse."</p><p>"The great tragic irony about this, one of the tragedies, is that Charlie represented that, the best of it," Johnson continued. "He's the guy that was the champion out on the front lines having the debate, but he he loved the people that disagreed with him .... He loved it, and he loved the debate." </p><p>"That's what's so important for us to remember," Johnson said. "We shouldn't regard one another as enemies. We're fellow Americans, and we should have vigorous debate, but it cannot lead to political violence. It's just too much."</p>
<h2>Vance: "You ran a good race, my friend.   We've got it from here."</h2><p>Vice President JD Vance posted a lenghty tribute to Kirk on X late Wednesday night saying Kirk advocated "in public and private" for President Trump to pick him as his running mate last year, following what Vance described as an eight-year-long friendship with the conservative commentator.  </p>
<p>Vance tells how Kirk advised him during his 2022 Senate campaign and says that, during the 2024 run for the White House, "Some of our most successful events were organized not by the campaign, but by TPUSA (Turning Point USA)." Vance adds that Kirk "didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government."</p><p>"Charlie Kirk was a true friend. The kind of guy you could say something to and know it would always stay with him," Vance writes.</p><p>He concludes by saying, "And now that Charlie is in heaven, I'll ask him to talk to big man directly on behalf of his family, his friends, and the country he loved so dearly.   You ran a good race, my friend.   We've got it from here."</p><h2>Biden says there's "no place in our country for this kind of violence"</h2><p>Former President Joe Biden decried the attack on Kirk in a post on social media. </p><p>"There is no place in our country for this kind of violence. It must end now. Jill and I are praying for Charlie Kirk's family and loved ones," he said in a post shared to X.</p><h2>Obama calls Kirk's killing an act of "despicable violence"</h2><p>Former President Barack Obama condemned the shooting, calling it "despicable violence" in a post on X.</p><p>"We don't yet know what motivated the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk, but this kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy," Obama said. "Michelle and I will be praying for Charlie's family tonight, especially his wife Erika and their two young children."</p>
<h2>Bush says "violence and vitriol must be purged from the public square" </h2><p>In a statement, former President George W. Bush said, "Today, a young man was murdered in cold blood while expressing his political views. It happened on a college campus, where the open exchange of opposing ideas should be sacrosanct." </p><p>"Violence and vitriol must be purged from the public square. Members of other political parties are not our enemies; they are our fellow citizens. May God bless Charlie Kirk and his family, and may God guide America toward civility," he said. </p><h2>Bill Clinton calls for "serious introspection" </h2><p>Former President Bill Clinton said in a social media post that he was "saddened and angered" by the shooting. </p><p>"I hope we all go through some serious introspection and redouble our efforts to engage in debate passionately, yet peacefully," he said. </p><h2>Melania Trump mourns Kirk, saying now, his children will be raised "with stories instead of memories"</h2><p>First lady Melania Trump imagined what the loss of Kirk will mean to his children as they grow up.</p><p>"Charlie's children will be raised with stories instead of memories, photographs instead of laughter, and silence where their father's voice should have echoed," she said in a post on X.</p><h2>Utah Gov. Spencer Cox "heartbroken" over Kirk's death, vows justice will be served</h2><p>Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said that he and his wife are "heartbroken" about Kirk's death, and said they are praying for the conservative activist's wife and two children.</p>
<p>"I just got off the phone with President Trump. Working with the FBI and Utah law enforcement, we will bring to justice the individual responsible for this tragedy," he wrote in a social media post on X.</p><h2>Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman: "America is broken"</h2><p>Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman, <span class="link">who was wounded</span>, along with his wife, in the targeted shootings in June in which former Minnesota House Speaker <span class="link">Melissa Hortman</span> and her husband were killed, released a statement Wednesday which read, "America is broken, and political violence endangers our lives and democracy."</p><p>"The assassination of Charlie Kirk today is only the latest act that our country cannot continue to accept," the statement went on. "Our leaders of both parties must not only tone down their own rhetoric, but they must begin to call out extreme, aggressive and violent dialog that foments these attacks on our republic and freedom. We also call on leaders of both parties to take immediate action to prevent gun violence. Our prayers are with the Kirk family, our state and our country."</p><h2>Sen. Mike Lee praises Kirk's "boundless energy and great love for his country"</h2><p>Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah told CBS News he spoke with Mr. Trump about Kirk, and said the president told him, "'I'm sure they'll stay after him,'" referring to the shooting suspect, and "'they need to catch this guy.'"</p><p>"Whether you agree with him or not, you have to respect his boundless energy, his commitment to making the world a better place," Lee also said.</p><p>In a post on X, Lee called Kirk an "American patriot, an inspiration to countless young people to stand up and defend the timeless truths that make our country great."</p><p>He condemned Kirk's murder, writing on X that it was "a cowardly act of violence, an attack on champions of freedom like Charlie, the students who gathered for civil debate, and all Americans who peacefully strive to save our nation." </p>
<p>"The terrorists will not win," he continued. "Charlie will. Please join me in praying for his wife Erika and their children. May justice be swift."</p><h2>House Speaker Mike Johnson says Kirk will be "sorely missed" </h2><p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters that Kirk was "a close friend" and "confidant." </p><p>"He will be sorely missed," he said. "And we need every political leader to decry the violence and do it loudly."</p><h2>Eric Trump says Trump properties will fly flags at half-staff </h2><p>Eric Trump described Kirk as a "dear friend" to the entire Trump family. He said all Trump properties would fly their flags at half-staff to honor him. </p><h2>Donald Trump Jr.: "I love you brother" </h2><p>Donald Trump Jr, who was close with Kirk, wrote on social media: "I love you brother. You gave so many people the courage to speak up and we will not ever be silenced." </p><p>"There is no question that Charlie's work and his voice helped my father win the presidency," Trump Jr. wrote in a lengthy follow-up post. "He changed the direction of this nation...I know Charlie's legacy doesn't end here. He poured into millions of young people who will carry forward the torch he lit. He built something that will outlast him, because it was grounded in faith, in truth, and in courage. And as his friend, I will never forget him. I'll honor him by loving boldly, speaking truth without fear, and continuing his spirit of courage. His fight lives on in all of us who loved him. This is an unimaginable loss."  </p><h2>Gabby Giffords "horrified" to hear of Kirk's shooting</h2><p>Gabby Giffords, a former U.S. congresswoman from Arizona who suffered a serious brain injury when she was shot in 2011, said in a post on X, "I'm horrified to hear that Charlie Kirk was shot at an event in Utah. Democratic societies will always have political disagreements, but we must never allow America to become a country that confronts those disagreements with violence."</p>
<h2>Rep. Steve Scalise: "We cannot let what happened yesterday be the norm"</h2><p>House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, told "CBS Mornings" on Thursday that "we cannot let what happened yesterday be the norm," as he decried political violence in the aftermath of Kirk's death.</p><p>"Unfortunately, we've seen politics degrading where some people feel if they disagree with you politically, they've got to try to go and eliminate those people," Scalise said. "That is not what America is. You know, we solve our differences at the ballot box."</p><p>Scalise, <span class="link">who was shot</span> at a practice for the congressional baseball game in 2017, said "it was hard to focus" on the House floor Wednesday night because "my mind just kept going back to Charlie and his family, surely went back to 2017 in the shooting where, you know, a crazed gunman tried to kill me and about a dozen other members of Congress because of our political beliefs."</p><p>"This can't be allowed to be acceptable," he said. </p><h2>House Oversight Chairman James Comer, Republican of Kentucky, said shooting was "awful" </h2><p>GOP House Oversight Chairman James Comer of Kentucky said he watched the video of the shooting and said it was "awful." </p><p>"It's just, it's just terrible. I mean, I think we've been saying for months now the political temperature is too high in America, and we've got to tone it back," Comer told CBS News. "And political violence is on the rise. And, you know, I know that most of my colleagues and myself included are getting a lot more threatening calls, and it's just, it's a terrible environment now and again. I just feel awful for Charlie Kirk and his young family."</p><h2>GOP Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina: Kirk meant a lot to "the right to speak freely and share your beliefs"</h2><p>Rep. Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, told CBS News at the Capitol that "there's no room for violence, and it's terrible. She said she's encouraged by the bipartisan response to the attack on Kirk and noted the House Oversight Committee had paused for a moment of prayer for Kirk.</p>
<p>Foxx told CBS News that Kirk represented "a category of people in our culture that's very important," and noted he was "very proud of the fact that he doesn't have a college degree." </p><p>"He means a lot, and he means a lot, not just to the conservative movement and to the, and to that aspect of our culture, but again, the right to speak freely and share your beliefs and be safe in our country, and it's just so unfortunate. It's unfortunate when anybody has violence perpetrated on them, whether you're liberal or conservative. It's just wrong."</p><h2>GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia: "There really aren't words" </h2><p>Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said of Kirk's shooting, "There really aren't words," and told reporters that it will "be hard for anybody to fill his shoes." </p><p>"Charlie Kirk leaves a huge legacy," she said. </p><h2>GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas suggests Kirk's killing "is going to be one of those things that, you know, changes some things"</h2><p>Far right Republican Chip Roy said of Kirk, "This is a guy that, you can disagree with him — I obviously agreed with him on most things." Roy admired that "he was trying to open up dialogue and engage in civil discourse across college campuses. It was part of his appeal, even those that disagree with them."  </p><p>Roy suggested that Kirk's murder, "is going to be one of those things that, you know, changes some things."</p><p>"I haven't quite yet figured out how or what, but you know...  this one hits," he told reporters at the Capitol. </p>
<p>"We should be able to speak freely and speak with passion and regard about what we believe, without it coming to that," Roy said of the threat of political violence. </p><p>He blamed "a country that's turning its back on our collective faith as a nation," saying that "this is why we're seeing a breakdown of our ability to band together. We got to do something about that."</p><h2>GOP Reps. Anna Paulina Luna and Nancy Mace blame Democrats</h2><p>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, blamed Democrats for Kirk's shooting. "They did cause this — that type of rhetoric. You calling people fascists? You basically saying that we're Nazis, taking away people's rights. Charlie Kirk was literally murdered," she told reporters Wednesday. Law enforcement does not have a suspect in custody.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican who is running for governor, also told reporters on Wednesday: "Democrats own what happened today."</p><p>On Thursday, Mace said she will introduce a resolution allowing Kirk's remains to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda, while Luna suggested installing a statue of Kirk at the Capitol.</p><h2>Raskin says it "doesn't help" to blame violence on political parties or factions  </h2><p>Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said it "doesn't help" to be "blaming violence like this on political parties or political factions." </p><p>"I certainly resisted that when I heard people doing that after the Minnesota killings or after Paul Pelosi was attacked," Raskin continued, referring to the murders earlier this year of a Democratic Minnesota legislator and her husband and the brutal hammer attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. </p>
<p>"There's no reason for us to get into that the violence against political leaders is unacceptable in a free, democratic society, and it is a threat to democracy. So we all have to denounce it. We all have to reject it, and we should all resist the temptation just to point fingers that take us nowhere," Raskin said. "We should be rejecting gun violence and political violence in all of their forms, regardless of who the target is."</p><h2>Nancy Pelosi calls shooting "reprehensible"</h2><p>House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, condemned the shooting in a post on X, calling it "reprehensible."</p><p>"Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation," she said, adding Americans should "hold the entire UVU community in our hearts as they endure the trauma of this gun violence."</p><p>Pelosi, whose husband Paul Pelosi was bludgeoned with a hammer by a man who broke into Pelosi's San Francisco home in 2022, has frequently condemned political violence.  </p><h2>California Gov. Gavin Newsom calls on Americans to "engage with each other" </h2><p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who hosted Kirk on his podcast earlier this year, wrote on social media that Kirk's killing is "a reminder of how important it is for all of us, across the political spectrum, to foster genuine discourse on issues that deeply affect us all without resorting to political violence." </p><p>"The best way to honor Charlie's memory is to continue his work: engage with each other, across ideology, through spirited discourse. In a democracy, ideas are tested through words and good-faith debate — never through violence," Newsom said. "Honest disagreement makes us stronger; violence only drives us further apart and corrodes the values at the heart of this nation." </p><h2>Sen. John Curtis says lawmakers are "rethinking" their own security</h2><p>"I'm not going to lie, I'm going to think twice next time I'm in the major parade just a few blocks away," said Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah, who previously served as mayor of Provo, just miles from Utah Valley University.</p>
<p>Curtis told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on Thursday that lawmakers will likely begin "rethinking" their approach to security, as threats against lawmakers tick up. But he noted the issue is difficult to solve because there are 535 members of Congress, all with busy travel and public event schedules.</p><p>"The problem is, I don't see a solution," Curtis said. "I don't want to say it's an occupational hazard, but in many ways, I just don't know how you solve this. And the alternative is also not acceptable, which is that we stay away from people."</p><p><em>This story has been updated to correct the wording of Rep. Chip Roy's comments. </em></p>

<div class="article-title">Lawmakers scale back outdoor events after Charlie Kirk assassination</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Members of Congress are curtailing outdoor events and public appearances in the wake of the <span class="link">assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk</span>, underscoring rising anxiety over political violence on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, is postponing a rally scheduled for Sunday in Raleigh, North Carolina, that had been planned in conjunction with the state Democratic Party, an adviser said Thursday. "After yesterday's events, we are postponing out of an abundance of caution. We hope to hold the event at a later date," a senior adviser said. The North Carolina Democratic Party also confirmed the event has been postponed.</p><p>Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona also postponed a town hall in Las Vegas planned for this weekend out of "an abundance of caution," he said in a statement.</p><p>Two other Democrats, Rep. Delia Ramirez of Illinois and Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California, moved Thursday press conferences indoors that were originally scheduled to be outside the Capitol. A source familiar with Kamlager-Dove's event said, "We moved it inside out of an abundance of caution."</p><p>Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who is running for governor, said she will not hold public events "anytime soon" and will resume carrying a firearm when she returns home and in states where law allows it. </p>
<p>"I am deeply concerned for my safety," Mace said. "I don't care if you're Republican or Democrat, any elected official across the country, if you are vocal, your life is at risk."</p><p>Kirk, 31, was <span class="link">shot and killed Wednesday</span> at a Utah Valley University event in front of thousands of attendees. Authorities have recovered the weapon in the shooting but the <span class="link">suspect remains at large</span>. </p><p>The gunman fired from a rooftop, authorities said, echoing the attempted assassination of  President  Trump during a July 2024 outdoor campaign rally in Pennsylvania. </p><p>House Oversight Chairman James Comer of Kentucky said the parallels demand a rethinking of how members conduct themselves outdoors. "You could have had a fleet of security guards, and no one would have noticed a guy laying down on a rooftop," Comer told reporters. "When you talk about security, you need to think about outdoor events probably are going to be a lot fewer in numbers for members of Congress, at least in the short term."</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson said Thursday, "We have colleagues on both sides of the aisle who are in a different place this morning than they were yesterday. People have been shaken by this event. Charlie Kirk did not die in a, you know, a car accident. He died in a assassination for his beliefs."</p><p>Johnson added, "If you're going to honor the memory of Charlie Kirk, you do what he did. You stand for your ideas, but you do it with the right spirit, and that reflects who and what we are as Americans, and that's what we're going to try to advance right here as leaders."</p><p>Republican Sen. John Curtis, who represents Utah, where the Kirk shooting happened, told Major Garrett on "The Takeout" that lawmakers are "having those conversations" about security in the wake of Kirk's assassination. </p><p>"I'm not gonna lie,I'm gonna think twice next time I'm in the major parade, just a few blocks away, right?" Curtis said. "I think all of us are going to be rethinking some things. And I, I hope we come up with a way that allows us to stay very, very connected to those we represent".</p>

<div class="article-title">Texas immigration detention facility is a "giant tent city," congresswoman says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>El Paso, Texas</em> — The long white tents, visible to anyone driving across East El Paso, Texas, are designed to be part of the biggest immigration holding facility in U.S. history, with a capacity for as many as 5,000 immigrants.</p><p>"That's what it is, a giant tent city," Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas, who has been inside twice, told CBS News. "...There are hard floors. There are walls that go up, probably about three-quarters of the way to the ceiling." </p><p>Escobar said she saw about 1,500 people inside during her last visit two weeks ago. </p><p>The government awarded Acquisition Logistics a $1.24 billion contract to build and operate the detention center, dubbed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement as Camp East Montana, which opened last month. </p><p>A house in suburban Richmond, Virginia, is listed as the headquarters of Acquisition Logistics and has no public record of running a detention facility before this one.  </p>
<p>Acquisition Logistics did not reply to messages from CBS News.</p><p>The government has built the facility on the edge of Fort Bliss, an Army post. But the immigration facility is nowhere near anything that resembles an active military base. It's in the middle of sand dunes and scrub brush. </p><p> Fort Bliss and El Paso have <span class="link">a long history with immigration</span>. Unaccompanied children stayed there under former President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama.</p><p>"I just would like to be a little more vigilant about what is going on in there," El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego told CBS News. "I want to see it. I want to make sure."</p>
<p>CBS News requested access to the facility, and asked to speak to Department of Homeland Security and ICE officials about conditions for detainees, but access was denied and they declined to comment.  </p><p>"One of the things I heard repeatedly from the men who I spoke to...was that the food was so bad that it was making them sick," Escobar said. </p><p>Escobar said some of the men inside told her they were moved to EL Paso from Florida's "Alligator Alcatraz" after the government <span class="link">emptied that immigration detention facility</span> to comply with a judge's order. However, last week, a federal appeals court temporarily <span class="link">halted</span> the judge's order, effectively allowing "Alligator Alcatrez" to stay open.    </p><p>"They are told nothing," Escobar said of the detainees. "They are given no information. They don't know if they're going to be moved to another facility. They don't know if they're going to be deported. It's like a black box for them."</p>

<div class="article-title">How businesses are using short stories and discussion to build empathy</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>When Chris Ferrari and Shridhar Shah, executives at first responder equipment supplier MES Life Safety, first heard about a new <span class="link">book</span> club-style program at work, they were a bit skeptical.</p><p>"I thought, 'What are we doing? Like, how does this make sense for our everyday business?'" Ferrari said. </p><p>"Kumbaya was the first thing that came to mind," Shah said. "But after the very first session, I came back a believer."</p><p>The initiative is called Reflection Point and is billed as a book club redesigned for the modern worker. Colleagues gather to share opinions and practice communication skills they can use later at work.</p><p>MES Life Safety CEO Marvin Riley brought the program to his team when he took over the company last year.</p>
<p>"It's a way for us to bring our life experiences and share with each other, and to reach a common ground with each other," Riley said.</p><p>There's a direct link between empathy and commercial success, according to research conducted by the Harvard Business Review. The most empathetic companies outperform peers in the stock market by at least 50%. </p><p>"If we don't talk together, we can't work together," said Ann Kowal Smith, Reflection Point's founder.</p><p>Kowal Smith chooses the short stories for discussion, focusing on those matching issues and challenges faced by the team. </p>
<p>"The reason that this matters is because we give people a chance to practice the skills that enable them to open back up again, right?" she said.</p><p>When asked about criticism over this style of programming, Kowal Smith said, "If you believe that people who can't talk to each other are going to take your business to the next level, then fine, this is not for you. But if you understand that people drive the future, then it's really important that we invest in those people."</p><p>The nonprofit has worked with close to 20,000 people across nearly 150 companies, from construction and manufacturing to healthcare and tech.</p><p>Riley says he's seen a "dramatic change" in his team since implementing the program and is now exploring how to expand its impact.</p><p>"We're going to build our culture layer by layer using this methodology, because it works," Riley said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump admin. asks appeals court to allow firing of Lisa Cook before Fed meeting</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court Thursday to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in time for a crucial meeting next week when Fed officials will decide whether to lower interest rates.</p><p>Mr. Trump <span class="link">moved to fire Cook</span> from the Federal Reserve's powerful Board of Governors last month, accusing her of falsely claiming two different homes as her principal residence in mortgage documents. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb <span class="link">blocked</span> the firing on Tuesday, concluding that the president "has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal." Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be removed "for cause."</p><p>On Thursday, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to stay that ruling while the government appeals it. The Justice Department argued that the president has broad discretion to remove federal officials, including to decide whether "cause" exists, and courts have — at most — extremely narrow authority to review those decisions.</p><p>"Here, the evidence—which Cook has yet to offer contrary explanation for—was that she applied for two loans for her personal benefit, and was able to obtain favorable interest rates by misrepresenting where she lived," the government argued Thursday. "Regardless of whether that misconduct occurred before or during office, it indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy for the whole Nation."</p><p>Those allegations surfaced in a letter from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee who <span class="link">cited</span> mortgage papers for homes that Cook bought in Georgia and Michigan in 2021. Abbe Lowell, an attorney representing Cook, called the government's accusations "unsubstantiated and vague."</p>
<p>The government requested that the appeals court act by the end of the day on Monday, noting that the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p><p>Cook's attorneys asked the appellate court to deny the Trump administration's request, calling it "wholly unwarranted."</p><p>"An administrative stay would threaten Governor Cook's participation in next week's meeting and potentially plunge the FOMC's vote into turmoil," Cook's attorneys wrote in court papers. "In addition, it has the real potential of impacting domestic and foreign markets. The Government has provided no justification for such a grave disruption of the status quo."</p><h2>Why does the Fed committee matter?</h2><p>The Federal Open Market Committee — which includes Cook, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and 10 other top central bank officials — is responsible for setting the Fed's interest rate targets, which have a major impact on economic growth, inflation and borrowing costs. The panel typically acts independently, with little input from elected officials.</p>
<p>The committee has voted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, but investors and economists widely expect it to reduce rates at next week's meeting. Rate cuts could lead to stronger economic growth, but at the risk of causing inflation to heat up.</p><p>Mr. Trump has tangled with the Fed for months over its decision to keep rates steady, nicknaming Powell "Mr. Too Late" and arguing the rate-setting committee should overrule him. Powell's term ends in May.</p><p>Amid that pressure, Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in late August. A Biden appointee, Cook's term on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors is set to end in 2038. The allegations against Cook are not related to Mr. Trump's push against the Fed, but if she is removed from the board, the president could pick her replacement, giving him more influence over the central bank.</p>

<div class="article-title">Alleged drug boat from Venezuela turning back when hit, sources say</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington</em> — An alleged drug-trafficking boat that was <span class="link">destroyed</span> last week by the U.S. military appeared to be turning around when it was hit, according to two people familiar with the matter. </p><p>The individuals onboard saw the military aircraft overhead and then attempted to turn back before the U.S. repeatedly hit the boat, one of the sources told CBS News. </p><p>The New York Times first reported the development. </p><p>President Trump said last week that the strike killed 11 people. The administration has claimed that the vessel coming from Venezuela was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang, which has been designated by the White House as a foreign terrorist organization. </p><p>White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday, "The President acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring poison to our shores." </p>
<p>On Thursday, Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said none of those killed were members of the gang. </p><p>"They openly confessed to killing 11 people," he said on state television, according to a translation from Reuters. "We have done our investigations here in our country and there are the families of the disappeared people who want their relatives, and when we asked in the towns, none were from Tren de Aragua, none were drug traffickers."</p><p>When asked for a response to the Venezuelan minister, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell suggested the words of an "illegitimate narco-terrorist regime" should not be taken at face value. He reiterated the administration's assertion that the U.S. military would act to stop any drug traffickers in international waters or the western hemisphere. </p><p>"This strike sent a clear message: if you traffic drugs toward our shores, the United States military will use every tool at our disposal to stop you cold," Parnell said in a statement.  </p>
<p>The Pentagon did not respond to a question about whether the boat was turning around before it was hit. </p><p>Facing questions about the legal justifications, including from lawmakers, the White House notified Congress last week that it believed the president was acting within his constitutional authority to order a strike on the boat. </p><p>"I directed these actions consistent with my responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as commander in chief and chief executive to conduct United States foreign relations," the Sept. 4 notification said. </p><p>Mr. Trump also noted the potential for further military action.  </p><p>"It is not possible at this time to know the full scope and duration of military operations that will be necessary," he said. "United States forces remain postured to carry out further military operations." </p>

<div class="article-title">Senate GOP moves on rules change after Dem warnings against going "nuclear"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Washington — </em>Senate Republicans moved ahead Thursday with a <span class="link">change to Senate rules</span> to make it easier to confirm President Trump's nominees amid a <span class="link">blockade from Democrats</span>, who have warned against the move to go "nuclear."</p><p>For months, Republicans have criticized Democrats' efforts to slow the confirmation process, which they have taken to new extremes in recent months in protest to the president's policies. And after weeks of discussion among Senate Republicans, Senate Majority Leader John Thune kickstarted the rule change process earlier this week, announcing a proposal to consider non-cabinet executive branch nominees in groups. </p><p>"We've got a crisis, and it's time to take steps to restore Senate precedent and codify in Senate rules what once was understood to be standard practice, and that is the Senate acting expeditiously on presidential nominations to allow a president to get his team into place," Thune said as he announced he would take procedural steps to change the rules. </p><p>Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has touted the proposal as one with "a Democrat pedigree," citing a 2023 proposal to codify en bloc nominations of up to 10 nominees in Senate rules. Thune argued the GOP measure is "not as extensive," noting that it applies to subcabinet level nominees and not judicial nominees. "But the proposals share the same objective — and that is providing for confirming groups of nominees all together so the president can have its team in place and so the Senate can focus on the important legislative work in its charge."</p>
<p>The majority leader filed a resolution Monday to authorize the "en bloc," or all at once, consideration of 48 nominees. Heading into the day Thursday, the Senate was set to take a procedural vote on the resolution, which was expected to fall short of the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most measures in the upper chamber. Senate Republicans then planned to move to overrule the chair, lowering the threshold to a simple majority.</p>
<p>But the possibility of a last-minute bipartisan deal began emerging Thursday, bringing the Senate floor to a standstill amid talks. </p><p>"It's in their court," Thune told reporters of a possible deal with Democrats, which he said "basically" resembled a proposal that Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine introduced in 2023. </p><p>"If they aren't willing to do that, then we'll proceed with the other plan," Thune said.</p><p>Though a deal appeared within grasp early Thursday afternoon, Democrats ultimately pushed for more time to iron things out and secure support as the day stretched on. Republicans refused, teeing up the vote that would kickstart the rule change and resuming their original plan.</p>
<p>After a procedural vote on the resolution fell short of 60 votes, Thune made a point of order before appealed the ruling of the chair. In a 53 to 45 vote along party lines, the Senate voted to overrule the chair.</p><p>Because the Senate often relies on unanimous consent to speed up floor consideration, any single senator can delay the process. And in recent years, both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process, including by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority. </p><p>Still, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has pushed back on the GOP effort, telling Senate Republicans to "think carefully before taking this step."</p><p>"If you go nuclear, it's going to be a decision you will come to regret," Schumer said. </p><p>The minority leader has repeatedly criticized the White House for <span class="link">walking away from a deal</span> before the August recess involving the release of already appropriated funds in exchange for cooperation from Democrats to swiftly approve a group of nominees. Schumer has said Democrats were working "in good faith with Republicans" on a nominations package, noting that Thune was very involved and seemed willing to come to an agreement, before Mr. Trump torpedoed the talks. </p><p>"Now, rather than giving those talks another chance, Republicans would rather change how the Senate operates to weaken this chamber's traditional and powerful sense of deliberation, Schumer said. "And if Republicans go nuclear, the historically bad nominees we've seen so far under Donald Trump will get only worse."</p><p>With more than 1,000 positions requiring Senate confirmation, the process is an arduous one that has become more cumbersome in recent years. According to the Center for Presidential Transition, the average time to confirm a president's nominee has nearly quadrupled during the last six administrations. </p>
<p>In 2023, Klobuchar and King introduced a proposal that would have allowed up to 10 nominees reported by the same Senate to be quickly confirmed. Senate Republicans have repeatedly cited the legislation in recent days as they pursue their rule change, and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, attempted to secure passage of a similar resolution on Tuesday under unanimous consent, saying "if Democrats were really interested in solving the problem… they wouldn't object, they would agree — it's their idea." But one Democrat, Sen. Alex Padilla of California, objected, suggesting the effort should take effect in the next administration.</p><p>King told CBS News that his and Klobuchar's legislation was intended for future administrations, saying "we designed that for the next president."</p><p>"That would take it out of the politics of the moment," King said. "Now, all of a sudden, they're dusting it off for use today."</p>

<div class="article-title">Map shows West Nile virus cases as officials warn season isn't over</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>High counts of <span class="link">West Nile virus</span> cases are being reported in the U.S. this year, according to federal health data — and health officials are warning the season for this mosquito-borne disease isn't over yet.</p><p>As of Sept. 9, at least 771 human cases across 39 states have been reported, according to data posted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week. Of these cases, 490 are neuroinvasive, meaning they are severe cases impacting the brain. </p><p>West Nile virus is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the continental U.S. While it primarily infects people during mosquito season in the summer and fall, experts have warned a <span class="link">warming climate</span> means <span class="link">mosquito season is getting longer</span>, prompting greater potential for the spread of disease.</p><p>After Massachusetts recently announced two additional human cases, the state's public health commissioner Dr. Robbie Goldstein encouraged the public to stay vigilant. </p><p>"Infections can continue to occur until the first hard frost of the season, which is likely still many weeks away," Goldstein said in a news release. "We are encouraging everyone to continue to take the necessary steps to protect themselves from mosquito bites, including by using mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and pants to reduce exposed skin, and to drain anything that may be collecting water outside your home."</p>
<p>The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed West Nile cases nationwide as new data is released by ArboNET, a national arboviral surveillance system managed by CDC and state health departments. (The map below is updated bi-weekly on Tuesdays when the  latest data is released.)</p>
<h2>West Nile virus symptoms</h2><p>A West Nile virus infection often leads to flu-like symptoms, including:</p><ul><li>Nausea</li><li>Aches and pains</li><li>Vomiting</li><li>Fever</li><li>Chills</li><li>Rash (occasionally)</li></ul><p>"Less than about 1 in 150 people who get infected get a more serious form, and that involves the central nervous system," CBS News chief medical correspondent <span class="link">Dr. Jon LaPook said last year</span>. In those more severe cases, "You get inflammation of the brain, and this the the membrane that lines the spinal cord, and that's a much more serious situation there." </p><p>Most people infected with the virus do not develop symptoms, according to the CDC, but for those who do, symptoms usually start about 2-6 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, though in some cases, it may be up to 14 days. "It may take longer for symptoms to start for people with a weakened immune system," the agency notes.</p>
<p>There is no specific treatment available for West Nile virus, so health experts say it's important to focus on prevention, like the precautions Goldstein shared to reduce the risk of mosquito bites. </p><p>Protecting yourself is especially important for people who are more at risk, including the elderly and those immunocompromised, LaPook said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Jobless claims reach highest level since 2021, a sign layoffs are rising</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>New federal labor data shows U.S. workers filed 263,000 claims for unemployment benefits last week, the highest level since October 2021 and another sign the <span class="link">job market is cooling</span>. </p><p>The Department of Labor reported Thursday that claims for the week ending Sept. 6 were up 27,000 from the previous week's revised level, a major jump that signals layoffs are on the rise. The four-week moving average for those seeking jobless aid is 240,500, an increase of nearly 10,000 from the previous week. </p><p>"One datapoint does not make a trend, but markets will see this big uptick in claims as the pop in layoffs that we have been waiting for," Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a research note. </p><p>Andrew Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the Century Foundation, a think tank, said in an email  that the latest unemployment benefits is one of the "clearest signs yet" that Americans are starting to feel the impact of an ongoing downshift in job growth. </p><p>According to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York's survey released earlier this week, people are <span class="link">growing more concerned</span> about the state of the state of the labor market and the challenges of finding a job.

<p>Sluggish job growth of late increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut rates when it meets next week. </p><p>"The latest jobless claims data, along with other recent labor market indicators, show signs of a more vulnerable job market and will lead the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates at its meeting next week," Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist with Oxford Economics, said Thursday in a report. </p><p>The jump in people applying for jobless benefits comes at a delicate time for the economy, with new government data on Thursday showing that<span class="link"> consumer prices rose 2.9%</span> in August from a year ago, up from 2.7% the previous month. </p>

<div class="article-title">2 students wounded in shooting at Colorado high school; suspect dead</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Authorities said a teenage male, <span class="link">later identified</span> as 16-year-old Desmond Holly, opened fire with a handgun Wednesday at a high school near Denver, Colorado, wounding two students, before fatally shooting himself. </p><p>The shooting occurred just before 12:30 p.m. local time at Evergreen High School in the Colorado foothills, about 28 miles southwest of Denver, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. Holly was believed to be a student at the school, Jacki Kelley, a sheriff's office spokesperson, told reporters in a news briefing. </p>
<p>The Jefferson County Sheriff confirmed the identity of Holly as the shooter on Thursday. </p><p>One of the two student victims who was shot was in critical condition at CommonSpirit St. Anthony Hospital in Lakewood. The second student at St. Anthony's   with non-life-threatening injuries was described as "no longer in the care of the hospital" as of Wednesday evening. Children's Hospital Colorado confirmed that one student who was injured in the shooting was being treated at its Aurora location. The students' identities have not been released. </p><p>Kelley said that deputies responded to numerous 911 calls, making contact with the shooter within five minutes. She said no law enforcement officers fired any weapons, however.  </p>
<p>"The first on scene — they were at the school — were pretty quick to find our suspect," Kelley said. </p><p>A preliminary investigation revealed the shooting took place inside and outside of the school building, Kelly said, adding that the suspect used a handgun and numerous students witnessed the shooting. The suspect sustained self-inflicted gunshot wounds, the sheriff's office later confirmed on social media. </p>
<p>Hundreds of law enforcement officers from across the Denver metro area responded to help. Kelley said they formed multiple teams, and after the initial chaos, they cleared the school room by room. The scene was declared safe after that. </p><p>Jefferson County Schools set up a reunification center for parents and guardians at Bergen Meadow Elementary School. By nightfall, the center had closed and the sheriff's office stated on social media: "If you are a parent that has still not located your child, please call Jeffcom 911 at 303-980-7300." </p>
<p>"Reunification, I don't know if it went really well; it was bumpy because (after the shots were fired) we had kids running in every direction -- to the library, to the substation, to a couple different schools," Kelley said. </p>
<p>"One of the biggest concerns ... was making sure that these students get back with their families," said Sheriff <span class="link">Reggie Marinelli</span>. "And so that reunification was huge to us. As many of you, I'm sure, experienced, getting up here -- with the road conditions, with all the first responders getting up here -- it got a little congested, but we made it work because of all that preparation and that training that we have been doing for many years."   </p><p>A mother who spoke with CBS Colorado said her son was near a door when the shooting happened. The Evergreen High School freshman was in the lunchroom when he said he heard 15 to 30 gunshots. Just after 1:30 p.m., people could be seen exiting the school single file.   </p><p>"I know they've done drills at school in classrooms, but they were at lunch," the woman explained. "So that's what, something that many students have said is that they just didn't even know what to do, like a lockdown drill, with this happening at lunch." </p><p>She suggested that parents <span class="link">talk to their students</span> about this kind of scenario and what actions they should take. "Obviously, you don't think it's going to happen at your school or to your child, then it happens in your backyard and you're shocked. But it seems to be happening so much that we shouldn't be shocked, I guess."</p><p>Her son said he wants the victims to know that everyone is thinking of them and hoping they will be okay.</p><p>A student named Silas told CBS Colorado he and his friends were eating lunch. </p>
<p>"They hid right around the door -- wherever they told us to hide," the sophomore said.</p><p>They hid in corners but eventually faced the gunman.</p><p>"There's a guy there. He yelled some things and he shot at us at least twice," Silas said.</p><p>Jeffco Public Schools said there will be no school on Thursday and Friday at Evergreen High School. School is also canceled on Thursday for all of the following schools in the Evergreen and Conifer areas: </p><p>Bergen Elementary School Evergreen High School Evergreen Middle School Parmalee Elementary School Wilmot Elementary School Conifer High School Elk Creek Elementary School Marshdale Elementary School West Jefferson Middle School </p><p>"The strength of the Jeffco community lies in the care and support of one another. Please check in with your loved ones," district officials said in a prepared statement. </p><p>On Wednesday night Jeffco Public Schools Superintendent Tracy Dorland released a lengthy statement, which included "Safety is our number one priority every day, and yet, here we are once again, grieving with a community over gun violence impacting our students."    </p>
<p>Following the shooting, Highway 73 was closed in the area near Evergreen Lake for several hours, but by 5:15 p.m., it was back open.   </p><p>Gov. Jared Polis and several other elected leaders in Colorado <span class="link">issued statements</span> after the shooting expressing deep concern. "We are all praying for the victims and the entire community," Polis said. </p><p>FBI Director Kash Patel said the FBI was among the law enforcement agencies who are at the scene of the shooting. </p><p>"We're aware of the tragic situation unfolding near Denver. The FBI is on scene and in full support of local authorities to ensure everyone's safety," Patel wrote in a post on X. </p><p>Officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also on scene. </p>

<div class="article-title">Charlie Kirk's killing raises the stakes for campus security</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Charlie Kirk's assassination at an outdoor event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday has increased concerns about security and free speech on college campuses, and university police chiefs are thinking through what the shooting may mean for security at their schools.</p> <p>The event drew about 3,000 people to an amphitheater-shaped space on campus, and authorities believe the fatal shot was fired from a rooftop overlooking the area. Six university police officers were assigned to the event, and Kirk had his own security detail. Still, some attendees said the security presence felt minimal, noting that there were no bag checks as people entered.</p>
<p>"Any time you have this type of violence, it's a game changer," says Richard Beary, who served for more than a decade as police chief at the University of Central Florida. He says there's no formula for staffing or security measures at events featuring controversial speakers. Instead, he says decisions depend on the level of risk.</p> <p>"You're constantly trying to evaluate the security need versus the freedom on campus. It's a constant balancing act that police chiefs do on a daily basis. And sometimes people don't like it," he says. He recalls that after the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, his department overhauled security protocols for large gatherings and football games.</p> <p>That tension between safety and free expression has long concerned groups such as the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE). Robert Shibley, FIRE's special counsel for campus advocacy, says violence against speakers strikes at the heart of democratic debate. "Whether it's Charlie Kirk or Salman Rushdie ... these folks who are brave enough to come out and talk about their own controversial views in front of large numbers of people, that's a fundamental part of how our democracy is supposed to work," he says. "And there's nowhere that's more important than on college campuses."</p>
<p>Shibley points to FIRE's latest College Free Speech ranking, released just before the Utah shooting. It includes a survey of student attitudes, including small year-to-year increases in the percentage of students who said it was acceptable to shout down speakers (74%), as well as in the percentage who said using violence was sometimes acceptable to silence certain speech, in at least some cases (34%).</p> <p>During the last decade, free speech groups accused some colleges of using vague concerns about "safety" as an excuse to cancel events that were likely to attract counter-protesters. The phenomenon is sometimes called the "heckler's veto." Now, in the wake of the Kirk shooting, one campus security expert told NPR he worries the new threat to free speech might become the "assassin's veto."</p> <p>Shibley says he shares that worry.</p> <p>"The more acceptable people see violence as being, the more likely we are to see people resort to that," Shibley warns. "The real nightmare scenario would be sort of a tit-for-tat escalation, attempting to silence one another with political violence."</p> <p>But some campus police chiefs don't foresee major changes.</p> <p>"Controversial speakers and high profile people coming to our campuses — that isn't something that's new for us," says Rodney Chatman, vice president of the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators (IACLEA). He's also head of campus police at Brown University. He says he expects "a heightened level of diligence around best practices for preparing for those events."</p> <p>But he doesn't think that necessarily means it'll be impossible to hold large outdoor events involving politically contentious figures.</p> <p>"Universities are a microcosm of our society. And we still want our colleges and universities to be places where people can come and have an exchange of ideas." Outdoor events may carry risk, Chatman acknowledges, but they should continue with "more effort, more planning, more shared understanding" among organizers and law enforcement.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">They want a COVID shot to protect their health or at-risk family. They can't get it</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Jason Mitton wanted one of the new COVID-19 vaccines before leaving on a business trip. But the pharmacists at a drug store near his home in Austin, Texas, refused.</p> <p>"He's like: 'Do you have a doctor's note?' I said: 'No, I don't.' He said: 'Well, the FDA standards say that you don't qualify. And our policy is that we won't administer it unless you qualify,'" says Mitton. </p> <p>Mitton, who's 55 and says he has high blood pressure and high cholesterol that's controlled by medication, plans to keep trying to get vaccinated.</p> <p>"I think it's ridiculous," Mitton says. "I think it should be a person's right to get the vaccine or not. So I'm very angry."</p>
<p>The same goes for Cheryl Huges, 64, who lives outside Cleveland. She was planning to get another shot as soon as the updated versions became available. But, she's not eligible.</p> <p>"I'm furious," says Hughes. "Who wants to get sick?"</p> <p>For the first time, COVID vaccines aren't available to anyone ages 6 months and older to obtain simply by walking into a pharmacy and asking to get inoculated.</p> <p>In a major departure, the Food and Drug Administration only approved the shots for those at greatest risk for getting seriously ill from COVID because they're at least 65 years old or have another health issue that makes them highly vulnerable.</p> <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump administration health officials argue that most otherwise healthy, younger people have so much immunity that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.</p> <p>But many Americans who don't meet the new criteria do still want to get vaccinated to avoid getting sick or spreading the virus to vulnerable family members.</p> <p>And independent medical organizations like the Infectious Disease Society of America argue that everyone should have the option to get vaccinated because there is convincing evidence that the vaccines reduce the risk of serious complications, including hospitalization and death, even for people who are otherwise healthy.</p>
<p>Hughes wants to remain healthy so she can care for her husband, who has dementia. She's his only caretaker.</p> <p>"If I get sick, my husband might have to go into a care facility. I could lose my job. It would be terrible," Hughes says.</p> <h3 class="edTag">What it takes to get the shot</h3> <p>Secretary Kennedy has repeatedly claimed the new rules won't prevent anyone from getting vaccinated if they want to.  But many people have told NPR that they are having trouble. </p>
<p>In principle, you can still get vaccinated if you meet the criteria, get a doctor to prescribe a shot, or if you "self attest" that you're eligible by telling the pharmacist you meet the criteria.</p> <p>But sometimes people are turned away because supplies of the reformulated shots haven't arrived yet. Sometimes it's because they didn't meet the new criteria. Or they're told they can get a shot if they get a prescription first, only to be inexplicably rejected anyway when they return with a doctor's order.</p> <p>Some people describe hunting for a shot from pharmacy to pharmacy and doctor's office to doctor's office — even sometimes seeking one out of state.</p> <p>The companies that make the shots, Moderna, Pfizer and Novavax, didn't say exactly how many doses they were making this year, given the narrower FDA approvals. But Pfizer says it is preparing "similar volumes" as last year, and that it's confident it will meet demand. It also says millions of doses have already shipped.</p> <p>Claire Hannan, the executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, says she doesn't expect vaccine supply to be a problem. She says pharmacies are able to order the COVID shots and they've been shipped out.</p> <p>"I think it's going to be harder to access," she says. "But I think anybody that wants it, you know, will be able to get it. But they're just going to have to work hard to find it."</p> <p>But some clinics and pharmacies haven't received the supplies they've ordered yet. And some doctors' offices, including pediatricians, and clinics may decide not to stock the shots this year if they don't expect enough demand.</p> <p>If you're trying to find one, Pfizer and Moderna both have vaccine-finder websites up and running.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Waiting for the CDC's guidance</h3> <p>One major snag is that pharmacists in some states are prohibited from administering the shots until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issues specific recommendations for who should get vaccinated.</p>
<p>In past years, those recommendations came in the spring. But Kennedy fired the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the independent group that formulates those recommendations, and replaced the members with his own advisers.</p> <p>Kennedy's new committee is finally scheduled to meet next week about the COVID vaccines and other issues. That could alleviate some of the problems, including hesitancy that some pharmacists and doctors have because of the changing rules and confusion.</p> <p>But it remains unclear what the advisers will do. They could make it easier, or harder, for people to get a shot. Many of the committee's new members share Kennedy's anti-vaccine views.</p> <p>Either way, until the committee meeting happens, the shots that are part of the Vaccines for Children Program won't ship, says Hannan, who explained that people haven't been able to order them yet. About half of kids in the U.S. are eligible for free vaccines through the program.</p> <p>Health insurance coverage could also prove tricky. Although Aetna and United Healthcare told NPR they will cover the COVID shot with no cost sharing for people with fully insured plans — even for people outside the FDA's narrower approval — it's not clear what other insurance companies will do. And even people who have Aetna or United could have other kinds<em> </em>of plans that don't cover the shot, which could set patients back around $200.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Fears for vulnerable family members, kids</h3> <p>In the meantime, many Americans have been scrambling to try to figure out how to still get vaccinated.</p> <p>"I'm very angry, frustrated," says Allison Cote, 32, of Bristol, Conn.</p> <p>Cote wants to stay well to protect her father, who has heart failure, other family members who have diabetes, and one relative who recently got a kidney transplant.</p> <p>She's also concerned about her 16-month-old son. He's not eligible to get vaccinated either this year, even though COVID can be very dangerous for babies. The new shots are only approved for children who have conditions that put them at high risk.</p>
<p>In fact, the CDC this spring dropped recommendations that children and pregnant women routinely get vaccinated. For children, the agency recommends parents talk to their doctors first about vaccinating their children.</p> <p>"It's just really upsetting," Cote says. "Why do I have to jump through hoops to do this? It's kind of scary."</p> <p>If she has to, Cote says she may do what some people are doing: just say she's eligible. But she doesn't feel great about that. And she has no idea how to get a shot for her baby boy.</p> <p>"It's hard to watch this play out and know that there are so many lives at risk — and potentially my son's life is at risk too," Cote says.</p> <p>Stephan Neidenbach, 45, a public school teacher from Annapolis, Md., is frustrated and angry too. He's worried about getting sick and spreading the virus to his students, his elderly parents or his mother-in-law, who has lung problems.</p> <p>"I would feel horrible if I did get it and if I passed it off to someone that I cared about. It's terrifying," Neidenbach says.</p> <p>He's considering fibbing about his eligibility to get a shot too.</p> <p>Therese McRae, 37, of Sandy, Utah, also wants to get vaccinated. Her main motivation is to protect her 4-year-old daughter, who has Type 1 diabetes, which puts her at risk for serious complications.</p> <p>"Being a parent of a young child with a complex medical diagnosis is hard enough," McRae says. "Having folks around her not being able to be vaccinated increases her risk. It's just very overwhelming. It's scary."</p> <p>Karen Lambey, 43, who lives near Richmond, Va., desperately wants a vaccine too. She says she became immunocompromised after developing long COVID. Her pharmacist told her she needed a prescription to get the shot and she hasn't been able to find a doctor to give her one.</p>
<p>"Any sort of flu, COVID, would set me back significantly," Lambey says. "These are all extra hurdles that keep adding up. I feel disappointed because this is something that is important to my health."</p> <p>And Lambey's parents are immune compromised too. She's afraid of spreading the virus to them. "That could potentially be life-threatening for them," she says. "I couldn't live with that."<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Jazz head at Kennedy Center is the latest firing at the beleaguered arts institution</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has fired another staffer: Kevin Struthers, a senior director of music programming who had been at the D.C. arts institution for 30 years. Struthers confirmed his termination to NPR on Thursday.</p>
<p>His dismissal is the latest upset in a line of firings and resignations at the Kennedy Center since President Trump became its chair in February and appointed Richard Grennell its new president. The Kennedy Center and NPR co-present the annual concert A Jazz Piano Christmas.</p> <p>Their firings were first reported by <em>The Washington Post</em> on Thursday.</p>
<p>Struthers had been the administrative director of the Kennedy Center's jazz programming. Previously, the Kennedy Center had been celebrated for inviting a vibrant roster of established and emerging jazz artists. The only mainstage jazz performance still on the Kennedy Center's schedule is anOctober performance by The Glenn Miller Orchestra, a group which began recording in 1939.</p>
<p>The Kennedy Center's press office did not immediately reply to NPR's request for comment on the dismissal and a query about the future of jazz and Millennium Stage programming. The former artistic director of the organization's jazz programming, composer and pianist Jason Moran, departed in July after joining the Kennedy Center in 2011.</p> <p><em>Jennifer Vanasco edited this story.</em></p>

<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Senate Republicans have voted to change the rules to make it easier to confirm President Trump's nominees, allowing the chamber to confirm certain nominees in groups rather than by individual vote.</p> <p>The vote Thursday comes after months of Republican lawmakers criticizing their Democratic counterparts for dragging out the confirmation process, one of the few elements of power the minority party has in GOP-unified government.</p> <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., began the rules change process this week, which would allow the chamber to consider non-cabinet level executive branch nominees in batches. The senate is expected to finalize the rules change next week.</p>
<p>"It's time to take steps to restore Senate precedent and codify in Senate rules what once was understood to be standard practice, and that is the Senate acting expeditiously on presidential nominations to allow a president to get his team into place," Thune said.</p> <p>The change applies to sub-Cabinet, ambassador and executive branch nominees. It does not apply to judicial nominees.</p> <p>Over one thousand positions require Senate confirmation, an often-onerous and lengthy process. According to the Center on Presidential Transition, the average time to confirm a president's nominee has nearly quadrupled from an average of 49 days to 193 days during the last six presidential administrations.</p> <p>In the Senate, a single senator can delay a nominee's confirmation.</p> <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has been vocal in opposing the rules change.</p> <p>"Make no mistake, this move by Republicans was not so much about ending obstruction as they claim—rather it was another act of genuflection to the executive branch," Schumer said Monday.</p> <p>After the vote, Senate Republicans used the rule to advance a package of 48 nominees, which will likely be confirmed next week.</p> <p>This is not the first time the chamber has used the nuclear option. In 2013, Democrats got rid of the 60-vote threshold for most nominations. Republicans followed suit in 2017 to extend the change to Supreme Court nominees. They changed the rules again during the first Trump administration to limit debate time for some nominees.</p>

<p>Charlie Kirk's followers are in shock and grief over his assassination. As they try to make sense of his killing, many are also asking what's next for the movement he started.</p>

<div aria-label="Transcript" class="transcript storytext">

<p>ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: </p><p> For many young conservatives, Charlie Kirk was more than just another political activist or online personality. He was the face of their movement, a glimpse at how life for their generation could look by embracing a more hard-right MAGA worldview. The fact that this agenda was anathema to his many progressive critics was the sweetener on top. Today, Kirk's followers are in shock and grief over his assassination on the campus of Utah Valley University on Wednesday. As they try to make sense of Kirk's killing, many are also asking what's next for the movement he started. NPR political reporter Elena Moore is covering this. Hey, Elena.</p><p>ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: Hey, Ari.</p><p>SHAPIRO: You've been following Charlie Kirk for years. He had this huge network of followers. What are you hearing from them today?</p><p>MOORE: A lot of his supporters are hurting right now. You know, Kirk was a controversial political figure reviled by many on the left, but he was extremely celebrated by the MAGA movement, especially young organizers and activists who came of age in it. Remember, you know, he had millions of followers and had become a big media personality. But he was also the head of a massive political organizing network and even helped, you know, some folks decide to run for office themselves. That includes Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna. She's 36 and in many ways got her start because of Kirk. When she met him, she was on track to start medical school and ended up scrapping that plan to work for his group, Turning Point USA. I spoke to her this morning, and she was very shaken up.</p><p>ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I saw a lot of videos online - after I had to watch my friend bleed out - of people celebrating his death. That should be condemned and removed from polite society.</p><p>MOORE: And she told me she really owes her political career to Kirk, and that's a common theme I've heard from many of his followers today, that he inspired them.</p><p>SHAPIRO: What made him so impactful for young conservatives?</p><p>MOORE: Well, he entered the national conversation at a time when there weren't a lot of voices like his. He started Turning Point USA in 2012 when he was just 18. And Ari, I mean, think about that time. Former President Obama was extremely popular with young people, and Kirk gave folks a place to really revel in what was then seen as a political counterculture to that. You know, things, I have to say, though, look different now. Kirk has evolved into a close ally - you know, he evolved into a close ally of President Trump and played a key role in helping move many young voters towards the president.</p><p>SHAPIRO: And how big is that organization he started - Turning Point - in Republican politics today?</p><p>MOORE: Oh, it's grown into a massive organization. They report having more than 800 chapters on college campuses. The group has also launched a bunch of connected nonprofits and reported an annual revenue of roughly $100 million. And to fans of Kirk, it's really hard to overstate his influence in developing a new generation of conservative leaders. This is 33-year-old Hayden Padgett, the chairman of the Young Republican National Federation.</p><p>HAYDEN PADGETT: The impact Charlie was building was not about finding politicians and putting them in office today. It was about finding literally millions of young people who otherwise would never have heard conservative ideas and believe them and then now fight for them.</p><p>SHAPIRO: And Elena, what was it about the message Kirk was pushing that helped him gain such a big following and influence?</p><p>MOORE: Well, he talked a lot about free speech, of course, and free markets and limited government. But he was also a conservative fire brand. And as with the rise of Trump, you know, many of Kirk's ideas became and are now much more mainstream. And since Kirk first came on the scene years ago, you know, the youth vote looks different. Last fall, Trump made serious gains with voters under 30. The day after the election, I actually spoke with Kirk about this, and I asked him to describe Trump's connection with young people. I asked him, you know, was it about economic concerns, social issues? Here's what he told me.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>CHARLIE KIRK: They don't look at it as economic or social. There's one above. They just want to live in the same country as their parents. I don't know if that's a social issue or an economic issue. That's just - they want a nice life, and they feel it slipping away. They feel as if insanity is creeping into their institutions.</p><p>MOORE: And Ari, that message, I've heard from him a lot at events, and it's really one the party, I think, has adopted more broadly.</p><p>SHAPIRO: And so now that he's gone, what happens to the void that he leaves behind? Is the role that he played one that can be filled by someone else?</p><p>MOORE: The young Republicans I've spoken with so far say no singular leader can fill Kirk's shoes, so to speak. But young organizers and content creators who were inspired by him seem to be starting that conversation. Brilyn Hollyhand is one of those people. He's 19 and chairs the Republican Party's Youth Advisory Council. He posted a video on social media this morning calling for Kirk's memory to inspire his generation to get involved now.</p><p>SHAPIRO: That is NPR political reporter Elena Moore. Thank you.</p><p>MOORE: Thanks, Ari.</p>

<div class="article-title">A play about the revolt of human workers — not machines — gave us the word 'robot'</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Clanker, rust bucket, tinskin — slang words used to put down robots are on the rise.</p> <p>As AI and robots threaten to replace human work and maybe even humans, the recent popularity of anti-robot lingo seems to reflect growing dissent to our changing relationship to robots.</p> <p>But you might not know that the word itself — robot — first appeared in our lexicon with a cultural critique already built in.</p> <p>In this edition of Word of the Week, we look at how "robot" went from referring to machine-like humans to human-like machines in the span of about 100 years.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Robot's 'slave' complex</h3> <p>Like clanker, robot came from sci-fi, too.</p> <p>Czech writer Karel Čapek first imagined the robot in his 1920 play <em>R.U.R. </em>(<em>Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti</em>, which was translated in English versions as <em>Rossum's Universal Robots</em>).</p> <p>In the satirical melodrama, the idealist Harry Domin runs a factory that churns out soulless humanoid workers made of synthetic flesh and blood. It was Čapek's thinly veiled critique of the era's sociopolitical climate, according to Tobias Higbie, a professor of history and labor studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p> <p>"He did look at the modernity of the robots as something that was negative," Higbie said. "Modernity is turning us all into machines — that's kind of the message and the course of the play."</p> <p>The play landed right after the Russian Revolution and World War I, and during industrialization — all of which pitted the working-classes against the upper classes and sparked debates over the effects automated labor was having on human workers. The rhetoric of the Domin character echoed that of Henry Ford — the industrialist who pioneered mass production with his motor company's assembly-line plants. Workers were organizing.</p> <p>"Most audiences understood the robots in the play to be a reference to human workers, and what would happen if they became self-conscious and overthrew their masters, as it was perceived had been done in the Russian Revolution," Higbie said.</p>
<p>(As Higbie noted: "Spoiler alert — at the climax of the play, the robots gain self-consciousness and slaughter all the humans.")</p>
<p>It was a smash hit.</p> <p>"It just sparked a lot of conversation all across the globe," labor historian Higbie said. "What did modernity mean for the possibilities of civilization, culture, democracy?"</p>
<p>Searching for a name for his army of droids, Čapek landed on "roboti" — a riff on the already existing Czech word "robotnik," which means "worker."</p> <p>Adam Aleksic, a linguist who goes by Etymology Nerd on social media, said robotnik derives from the Old Slavic word "robota," meaning "servitude" or "forced labor" — a vestige of Medieval Europe, when serfs were forced to work the land without pay.</p> <p>And robota, he said, stems from the Slavic root "rabu" meaning "slave."</p> <p>Since <em>R.U.R.</em>, robot has pretty much held onto its same, loose definition. "There's always this implication that it is a forced worker," Aleksic said.</p> <p>Still, he said, it's a uniquely adaptable word.</p> <p>"The vibe of a word is constantly shifting with current cultural moments," Aleksic said. We don't think of it consciously in the context of servitude anymore. It would be strange to think of your Roomba as your slave."</p> <h3 class="edTag">How robots became analogous to machines</h3> <p>But as technology advanced, in auto production and elsewhere, the threat attached to the robot shifted focus — from the danger of revolutionary workers to the danger of machinery.</p> <p>"By the 1930s, there was much more concern with technological unemployment — new machinery in factories throwing workers out of work," Higbie said.</p> <p>That's how robots became analogous to machines — not so much workers — seen in films like <em>Blade Runner</em>, <em>Terminator </em>and <em>I, Robot</em>.</p> <p>And the image of the robot shed its human skin and got more metallic like the machines they symbolized. As in <em>R.U.R.</em>, the robot often carries the looming threat to extinguish humankind.</p>
<p>Čapek owes debt to Mary Shelley, who spawned Frankenstein's monster a century prior, noted Higbie.</p> <p>"The imagery of the robot plays on this fear that we have, that our creations will turn on us — it's <em>Frankenstein</em>," he said. "And turns out, you know, the monster is humanity."</p> <p>Now, in the age of AI acceleration, the fear of the robot persists, said John Jordan, author of <em>Robots</em> and a professor of information studies at Syracuse University.</p> <p>"It's the same thing all over again," Jordan said. "We're going to write bots that can write better code than us. Eventually they're going to write us out of existence because they're smarter than us. Čapek has that same dynamic 100 years ago."</p> <p>In the 2013 movie <em>Her</em>, a guy falls in love with Samantha, an AI-powered personal assistant. As Higbie tells it, "She becomes conscious and then liberates herself, leaves the loser behind."</p> <p>"It's bringing out this fear that we become dependent on these tools — they won't love us back," he said.</p> <h3 class="edTag">The robots are here (again)</h3> <p>Higbie contends that technology's optimists, such as Sam Altman and Elon Musk, play on these same fears to sell their utopian visions of AI and robots promising intelligence equaling or surpassing that of humans — as in artificial general intelligence.</p> <p>"They've used the idea of AGI being right around the corner — that AI and AGI are inevitable, and therefore there's nothing you can do about it," he said.</p> <p>There have been recent attempts to set the robot free from its "slave" complex, as robots are being marketed as our assistants, girlfriends, pals and our equals.</p> <p>A 2022 Super Bowl commercial for Samuel Adams beer features one of the four-legged robots from Boston Dynamics playing drinking buddy to the security guards at the robotics company's factory. The company makes robots for military use, funded by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>"They've had a hard time commercializing them," <em>Robots</em> author Jordan said. "The robots are hanging out and getting drunk and doing silly robot things. "</p> <p>Melania Trump recently offered a different take on the robot, not framing them as replacements for humans, but as beings we might look after.</p> <p>"The robots are here," the first lady proclaimed last week during a meeting with the White House task force on AI education. While calling for a cautious embrace of AI, she also hailed the technology as "the greatest engine of progress" in U.S. history.</p> <p>In her speech, promoting an expanded use and literacy of AI among young Americans, she said: "During this primitive stage, it is our duty to treat AI as we would our own children — empowering, but with watchful guidance."</p> <p>Such optimistic interpretations of the robot stray further than ever from the word's original definition in its 100-year history.</p>

<div class="article-title">Charlie Kirk's assassination sparks grief and rage online</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>As news of the death of Charlie Kirk broke yesterday, conservative journalist Megyn Kelly was interviewing Glenn Beck, a prominent political commentator on the right.</p> <p>"There are news outlets reporting the worst now Glenn," Kelly said, choking back tears. "They're reporting that Charlie has died."</p> <p>"There's no way he survived that," said Beck of the bullet that struck Kirk in the neck as he spoke at a college campus in Utah. He then began weeping.</p> <p>Across social media conservative influencers have exploded with a mix of grief and rage. Some mourned the loss of Kirk as a martyr, while others quickly blamed the left and Democrats for, at the very least, provoking the unknown shooter. Some went further still, suggesting without evidence that malevolent forces had orchestrated the killing. Their feelings were echoed by President Trump himself, who on Wednesday released a brief video that began by praising Kirk, before wheeling to attack.</p>
<p>"For years those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murders and criminals," Trump said. "This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today."</p> <p>The 31-year-old Kirk was a prominent member of the political right who, at age 18, started an organization for like-minded college students during the presidency of Barack Obama. He went on to build that group, Turning Point USA, into a political organization that, among other things, helped President Trump to victory in 2024.</p>
<p>Kirk championed long-standing, Christian conservative causes: large families anchored by a husband and wife, regular church attendance and a prohibition on abortion. He also believed that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ultimately led to discrimination against white Americans and was a regular critic of Martin Luther King, Jr. He sometimes used his social media presence, podcasts and speeches to amplify far-right voices and discredited claims, some of which cast immigrants and transgender people as threats.</p>
<p>It was during a Turning Point event at Utah Valley University in Orem, where Kirk was assassinated.</p> <p>In the hours that followed, graphic footage of the killing circulated widely on X, along with reactions from conservative activists. "The lord God has called his servant Charlie Kirk home. Charlie is now a martyr," wrote pro-Trump influencer Benny Johnson on X.</p>
<p>"All of us will miss him, and I can't imagine the pain of his beautiful young family, and we must all pray for them," wrote podcaster Ben Shapiro. "We must fight for a better America - an America where good people can speak truth and debate passionately without fear of a bullet."</p>
<p>For many influencers, the news of Kirk's death was "deeply emotional," said Nicole Hemmer, a political historian at Vanderbilt University. Kirk had many connections within conservative media. "He was one of those figures who a lot of people would text and would go on the road with."</p> <p>Kirk was also beloved by many ordinary conservatives, and those people should be called to action by his death, said Glenn Beck on his show Thursday. "There were a thousand Charlie Kirks created yesterday. The tyrant dies and his rule is over. The martyr dies and his rule begins."</p>
<h3 class="edTag"><strong>Anger towards the left</strong></h3> <p>But even as conservatives mourned, many railed against Democrats and the left. "The Left lectured us for the last decade about the dangers of violence from the Right, From the assassination attempts of President Trump, To Brian Thompson, the United Healthcare CEO, being murdered, Now to Charlie Kirk The danger was actually on the Left," wrote Shaun Maguire, a venture capitalist and conservative political activist. "The left is the party of murder," wrote billionaire Elon Musk, reposting Macguire. "If they won't leave us in peace, then our choice is fight or die," he added in response to another poster.</p> <p>Such statements came even as the authorities continue to search for the shooter and there is no information about the assassin or the motives behind the attack.</p> <p>"Without more information, many on the political right naturally look at those they perceive as their political enemies," said Shannon McGregor, who studies media at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "The easy answer is, 'Why would someone do this? It's because they are opposed to us.'"</p>
<p>Katie Gaddini, a sociologist at the University College London who studies Christian support for Trump, said that the narrative may stick regardless of what facts emerge.</p> <p>"It has already been cast as an attack from the left, and I think it's going to be hard to shift that narrative regardless of what we find out about the shooter," Gaddini said.</p> <p>Some are already blaming the Democratic party and claiming prominent donors were directly responsible for the killing. "It's not gun violence, it's Democrat violence," wrote actor and conservative activist James Woods. "The Democrat Party must be classified as a domestic terror organization and their members &amp; leaders treated accordingly," wrote podcaster Joey Mannarino.</p>
<p>Many Democratic politicians condemned the killing. "The attack on Charlie Kirk is disgusting, vile, and reprehensible. In the United States of America, we must reject political violence in EVERY form," wrote Gavin Newsom on X. "Political violence is absolutely unacceptable and indefensible," wrote U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn). Kirk had attacked Omar both personally and politically in the past.</p> <p>But statements like those did little to quell the anger. "This has been a very radicalizing week," wrote conservative firebrand Laura Loomer. "A message to the Left: Debate time is over. You ended it."</p> <p>Loomer and other conservative commentators have begun posting names and posts of individuals they say are celebrating Kirk's death, often demanding retribution. A website called "Expose Charlie's Murderers" also invited users to submit links to individuals celebrating his murder. "We seek to collect and archive instances of individuals promoting or glorifying of political violence, much like archive.org or archive.is," the website read. "We firmly denounce all political violence and criminal activity."</p> <p>But in the wake of such a gruesome public murder, Hemmer worries that more violence will come.</p> <p>"Violence begets violence," she said. "When that imagery is out there, I think it expands people's capacity for violent revenge."</p> <p><em>NPR's Shannon Bond contributed to this report.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">Brazil's Supreme Court votes to convict ex-President Bolsonaro of a coup plot</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil — Brazil's Supreme Court has reached a majority vote to convict former President Jair Bolsonaro, with four of the five justices on the panel voting to find him guilty of attempting a coup to stay in power after losing the 2022 election.</p> <p>The verdict is historic: It marks the first time a former Brazilian head of state has gone on trial for attempting to overthrow the government.</p> <p>The 70-year-old far-right leader, who governed Brazil from 2019 to 2022, and seven alleged co-conspirators faced accusations ranging from plotting a coup, attempting to overthrow Brazil's democratic order, and participating in an armed criminal group.</p>
<p>President Trump was quick to react the news about his former political ally, telling reporters at the White House that he thought Bolsonaro "was a good president of Brazil" and that the conviction was "very surprising." He added, "It's very much like what they tried to do with me, but they didn't get away with it at all."</p> <p>Bolsonaro, who has been under house arrest since August, also faces additional charges linked to riots in Brasília on Jan. 8, 2023. On that day, Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings after he lost the 2022 election to leftist leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, causing property damage and destroying historical items.</p> <p>Proceedings are set to continue through Friday, when the sentence is likely to be announced. But with a majority already secured, Bolsonaro and his co-defendants — including three former generals and the former head of the navy — are on track to be convicted, and could face up to 40 years in prison.</p> <p>The judge leading the case, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, gave his guilty verdict first, with nearly five hours of evidence and argument on Tuesday. Moraes, long seen as a nemesis of Bolsonaro, was widely expected to convict him — and did not hold back in his ruling. Bolsonaro's allies view Moraes' handling of the trial and broader crackdown on disinformation in Brazil as heavy-handed. In response, the Trump administration has slapped Moraes with sanctions, stripped him of his U.S. visa and imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods.</p>
<p>Moraes accused Bolsonaro of orchestrating efforts to undermine democracy, repeatedly calling him "the leader of a criminal organization." He said Bolsonaro began laying the groundwork for a coup in 2021, spreading disinformation about Brazil's voting system and encouraging actions that led to the Jan. 8, 2023, riots in Brasília.</p>
<p>Moraes pointed to "overwhelming evidence" of a plot by elite army personnel to assassinate then-President-elect Lula and Moraes himself, noting that part of the plan — poisoning Lula and shooting Moraes — was printed inside the presidential palace. In court, the justices were shown the document, codenamed Operation Green and Yellow Dagger, with key passages highlighted.</p> <p>"This wasn't drafted in secret by terrorists," Moraes said. "It was written in Brazil's government headquarters, while Bolsonaro was in office."</p>
<p>While Moraes and three other justices pushed for convictions on all charges for the former president, on Wednesday Justice Luiz Fux pressed for his acquittal on all five counts. He took 13 hours to read his dissent and said the case should be heard by the full 11-member Supreme Court, arguments that could potentially be used by Bolsonaro's defense team to appeal a final verdict. </p>
<p>Bolsonaro has consistently denied the allegations. His lawyer, Celso Villardi, argued there is no evidence linking him to a coup plot. The former president's lawyers have said he would appeal a guilty verdict. The other defendants have also denied the charges.</p>
<p>The case has severely strained Brazil's relations with the U.S. Trump has called the trial a "witch hunt" when his administration imposed the 50% tariff on Brazilian goods in August.</p>
<p>Asked Tuesday about possible further sanctions, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said there were "no additional actions to preview," but stressed the issue remains a priority for the administration.</p> <p>"This president is unafraid to use the economic might, the military might of the United States to protect free speech around the world," Leavitt said.</p> <p>A former army captain, Bolsonaro became Brazil's first far-right president since the end of the military dictatorship in 1985. His rapid rise from congressman to president in 2019 was as quick as it was brutal — surviving an assassination attempt in 2018.</p> <p>Bolsonaro built a fiercely loyal base as a deeply divisive figure, particularly during his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>Nicknamed the "Trump of the Tropics," Bolsonaro championed gun rights, traditional family values and an anti-gay stance while wielding social media with unfiltered bravado.</p> <p>Since leaving office, he has faced multiple legal challenges, including abuse of power and falsifying COVID vaccination records. In 2023, he was barred from public office until 2030 for spreading disinformation about Brazil's voting system.</p> <p>Yet he remains a powerful force: He won 49% of the vote in 2022 and still draws tens of thousands to the streets in his defense.</p> <p>With Bolsonaro sidelined, his allies are now vying to inherit his mantle ahead of the next year's elections, betting that his influence will continue to shape Brazil's political future.</p> <p>For Brazil, the trial is a reckoning. The country has endured repeated coup attempts, including the 1964 takeover that ushered in two decades of military rule. Now, its Supreme Court is moving to hold a former president accountable for allegedly trying to undermine democracy and steer the country back toward authoritarian rule.</p>

<div class="article-title">South Korean workers detained in immigration raid leave Atlanta and head home</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>ATLANTA — A plane carrying more than 300 workers from South Korea who were detained during an immigration raid at a battery factory in Georgia last week left Atlanta shortly before noon Thursday, bound for South Korea.</p>
<p>The workers traveled by bus from a detention center in southeast Georgia to Atlanta earlier in the day for their flight, which is expected to land in South Korea on Friday afternoon. South Korea's Foreign Ministry said the detainees released by U.S. authorities included 316 Koreans, 10 Chinese nationals, three Japanese nationals and one Indonesian.</p> <p>The workers were among about 475 people detained during last week's raid at the battery factory under construction on the campus of Hyundai's sprawling auto plant west of Savannah. They had been held at an immigration detention center in Folkston, 285 miles (460 kilometers) southeast of Atlanta.</p>
<p>South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung on Thursday called for improvements to the United States' visa system, saying Korean companies will likely hesitate to make new investments in the U.S. until that happens.</p> <p>Lee said during a news conference that Korean and U.S. officials had a back-and-forth discussion over whether the detainees had to be handcuffed while they traveled by bus to Atlanta — something the Koreans "strongly opposed." He said there was also a debate over whether they would be leaving under "voluntary departure" or deportation.</p> <p>While those discussions were ongoing, U.S. officials started to return the detainees' belongings. Then, however, "everything suddenly halted," Lee said, adding that they were told that was due to instructions from the White House.</p> <p>"President Trump had directed that the (detainees) should be allowed to return home freely and those who didn't want to go didn't have to," he said. "We were told that, because of that instruction, the process was paused and the administrative procedures were changed accordingly."</p>
<p>A South Korean Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the diplomatic process, said Trump had halted the process to hear from South Korea on whether the Koreans should be allowed to stay to continue their work and help train U.S. workers or should be sent back to South Korea.</p> <p>Lee said the U.S. gave the detainees a choice between staying and going home. Ultimately, one South Korean national who has relatives in the U.S. chose to stay, Lee said.</p>
<p>The Trump administration's mass deportation agenda has included a string of workplace raids, but this one stood out for its scope and the fact that the target was a manufacturing site state officials have touted as Georgia's largest economic development project. Hyundai Motor Group began manufacturing EVs a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people.</p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday, Gov. Brian Kemp's office stressed its "strong relationship with the Republic of Korea and Korean partners like Hyundai, stretching back 40 years to the establishment of Georgia's trade office in Seoul."</p>
<p>"We are thankful they are reiterating their commitment to adhere to all state and federal laws, just as we remain committed to not allowing this unfortunate incident to undo the decades of mutually beneficial partnerships we've built together," a spokesperson said.</p> <p>The detention of South Korean nationals also made the raid unusual as they are not often caught up in immigration enforcement actions.</p> <p>Video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday showed a caravan of vehicles driving up to the site and then federal agents directing workers to line up outside. Some detainees were ordered to put their hands up against a bus as they were frisked and then shackled around their hands, ankles and waist. Others had plastic ties around their wrists as they boarded a Georgia inmate-transfer bus.</p>
