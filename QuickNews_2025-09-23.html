<div class="article-title">King Charles’ former butler says Prince Harry’s account of royal life ‘doesn’t add up’</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>King Charles III’s former butler, who served the monarch for seven years, said he was surprised by Prince Harry’s claims in "Spare."</p><p>Grant Harrold has written a memoir, "The Royal Butler: My Remarkable Life in Royal Service," where he details his time working with and befriending King Charles and Queen Camilla. The etiquette expert told Fox News Digital he was stunned when he first read Harry’s 2023 memoir, where the Duke of Sussex described his struggles with royal life.</p><p>"I’ve openly talked about this because … his memories and mine are very different," said Harrold. "You think we [were] in two different households because I talked about this happy family … with his stepmother and everything. He’s saying he didn’t. I never witnessed that."</p><p>"I saw some magazine [clippings] the other day … from the king’s wedding," said Harrold. "When you look at these pictures of Harry around his stepmother, both leaving Windsor and chasing after the cars, that’s not somebody who’s unhappy. If he was really that unhappy, I know people who wouldn’t even go to weddings or wouldn’t even get involved because they’re unhappy. And I was there the night before. There was a dinner for [Prince] William, Harry and the king. ... it was a lovely occasion … There were no issues."</p><p>A spokesperson for Archewell, which handles the office of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, previously told Fox News Digital they would not be commenting on Harrold’s book.</p><p>In "Spare," Harry describes in detail his sibling rivalry with his brother William, heir to the British throne, and the death of their mother. In the opening chapter, Harry wrote that his father, then Prince Charles, broke the news of his mother’s accident but didn’t hug his son. He also wrote that he and William both "begged" their father not to marry Camilla, worried she would become a "wicked stepmother."</p><p>Harrold stressed he never witnessed any unhappiness from Harry during his time as a working royal. The Duke of Sussex and his wife stepped back as senior royals in 2020 and moved to California. The couple cited the unbearable intrusions of the British press and a lack of support from the palace as their reasons for leaving.</p><p>It's unknown if the father of two simply kept his private thoughts about his royal life to himself until now, Harrold noted.</p><p>"With mental health, you sometimes have no idea someone is unhappy about anything," said Harrold. "He could have been pretending. … I’m not saying he’s not [sincere], but all I know is there was no evidence of him being unhappy at all or suffering from any kind of mental health issues. But it’s a silent thing, so it’s possible. But nobody knew."</p><p>"My memories are definitely very different from his," said Harrold. "It’s almost as if it were a different household, but it wasn’t. That was his household, it was his home. And it’s where I spent a lot of time as well." </p><p>"It’s interesting because the queen said, ‘recollections may vary,’" Harrold continued. </p><p>"She talked about that toward the end of her life about the situation. And it’s true. My memories and Harry’s are obviously very different. It’s up to people to read my book and make their own minds about it. But I think … if they read what I’ve put, look at press clippings or any TV footage from back in the day, they can then make their minds up. And I think it’ll be quite obvious that something, as I keep saying, doesn’t add up."</p><p>In televised interviews before the publication of "Spare," Harry accused Camilla of leaking private conversations to the media to improve her reputation, The Associated Press reported. He said members of the royal family got "into bed with the devil" to gain favorable tabloid coverage. He singled out Camilla’s efforts to rehabilitate her image after her longtime affair with his father.</p><p>"That made her dangerous because of the connections that she was forging within the British press," Harry, 41, told CBS. "There was open willingness on both sides to trade information. And with a family built on hierarchy, and with her on the way to being queen consort, there was gonna be people or bodies left in the street."</p><p>Buckingham Palace never publicly responded to Harry’s book.</p><p>Harrold worked in the king’s household from 2004 to 2011. He was invited to Charles and Camilla’s wedding in 2005 as a guest.</p><p>"At the end of the festivities, Charles and Camilla were catching a flight to head straight to Birkhall," he recalled in his book. "We all went outside to wave them off and laughed as we saw William and Harry had decorated their car with ‘Just Married.’ As they drove off through the arches to cheers, the boys raced after the car, followed by the media."</p><p>Harrold described Charles as a "fantastic father," a doting parent who looked after his sons after they lost their mother, Princess Diana, in a tragic accident. The late Princess of Wales died in 1997 from injuries in a Paris car crash. The princes were 15 and 12 years old at the time.</p><p>"A lot of people assume that he wasn’t hands-on, or he wasn’t around," Harrold explained to Fox News Digital. </p><p>"Yes, his duties were very different, especially after the divorce, to what Princess Diana was doing. But equally, they both made time for the boys. They both were hands-on, they both did things in their own way. Diana might have taken them to a water park, for example, but the king would [also] take them up to Balmoral to do a bit of shooting or fishing in the countryside, which they loved."</p><p>"Both parents brought something very different to the table, but the boys liked that," said Harrold. "I think their characters have been shaped by both parents and grandparents. I was talking about Harry the other day, and someone said, ‘He comes across as being quite stubborn.’ I said, ‘Well, you could say that’s from his grandfather, Prince Philip… because his grandfather was quite stubborn. His mother stood her ground. You could argue that side as well. But this is what’s great about them."</p><p>"William’s got a bit of shyness and a bit of quietness, which comes from his mother and, to a degree, from his father," Harrold continued. </p><p>"But when I was there, I did witness a father who was hands-on. He was very funny with them. He was very sweet with them. And he definitely tried to fill a gap, 100 percent. He was trying to fill that space their mother’s death had left. He was definitely trying, not to replace her, but to fill that space."</p><p>Harrold said he remains grateful for his experience working at the palace and for witnessing another side of the royals.</p><p>"I suppose the thing that surprised me was probably … how normal he is," said Harrold, referring to the king, 76. </p><p>"Like everybody else … you see them, you read stuff, and you hear stuff. And we all make up our minds about what those people are like. And they always say, don’t meet your idols because it’s not what you imagine. But luckily for me, meeting this family that I followed throughout my childhood and teenage years, it was exactly what I hoped they would be."</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Young conservatives fear campuses unsafe after Charlie Kirk killing, but vow to press on</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Young conservatives are reflecting on how Charlie Kirk inspired them to boldly and unashamedly stand up for their beliefs.</p><p>Fox News Digital attended the Texas Youth Summit in The Woodlands, Texas, to speak with attendees about the legacy Kirk leaves behind following his assassination.</p><p>"Charlie Kirk was one of the first people who got me into politics," said Fred, a college student and the Vice Chair of Special Affairs for the Young Conservatives of Texas. "I started watching when I was a freshman in high school a few years ago. And Charlie... he was my inspiration for getting involved on campus at [Southern Methodist Univerity]." </p><p>Braelunn from Montgomery, Texas, said, "I believe that the assassination of Charlie Kirk was not only an attack on someone I watched, and I adored, but is an attack on my First Amendment right."</p><p>Paul, who is originally from California but now resides in Houston, said he was familiar with Kirk's work as the founder of Turning Point USA, but in the wake of the assassination, he got to know his story better.</p><p>"Since what's happened last week, I think I've got to learn more about his life and his legacy, and he's almost even more of an inspiration now," he said.</p><p>Shaylin, originally from Canada, shared how Kirk was a model to her. </p><p>"Charlie Kirk is someone who I've been watching for 10 years in my life, and he has been the one that has showed me what it looks like to live a radical life of being grounded in morals and truth and what it means to be even bold in your faith," she said.</p><p>Natalie attends Austin College, which she described as very liberal, but Kirk's legacy inspired her to not fear speaking out. </p><p>"He has helped in encouraging me to speak up about my beliefs and have civil discussions with people who may not agree with you and, even if the person that disagrees with you, backlashes with violence or aggressive insults or cursing, obviously, to keep it respectful," Natalie told Fox News Digital. </p><p>Following the assassination of Kirk, these young conservatives said they are more determined than ever to share their views openly.</p><p>Noel, a student at Dallas Baptist University, said, "I do not think they are safe on campus, but as a believer and as a fellow conservative myself, I think conservatives now more than ever are bolder and standing for what they believe in, despite the fact that they know that they are in trouble. And it's sad that we've gotten to that point."</p><p>However, Noel shared the importance of being bold in your values. </p><p>"We're standing up bolder, stronger, more than we've ever known…  As Christians, we're guaranteed that persecution in this life, but that's part of the cost, and we know that," he told Fox News Digital. "We were prepared for that, and I think truly now we understand that it's there, but we also understand that our mission is greater and the consequences that could happen."</p><p>Ella, a student at Lone Star College, said, "So in the past, I used to be kind of nervous, but I mean, I have God in my life and I know I'm going to be spreading His word in my politics and in the way that He has shaped my life and who I am as a person, and I'm not afraid of anybody, the only person I'm afraid of is God."</p><p>Will, a Young Conservatives of Texas state board member, said he's troubled by where the country is heading.</p><p>"I think a lot of schools are going to start putting in more security," Will said. "We're taking it a lot more serious now. Never before in America did you have to worry about getting shot for your opinions, but now we're there, I guess. It's sad."</p><p>Fred added that his school, Southern Methodist University, is working to keep students safe and is confident about other campuses in the Lone Star State. </p><p>"I'm sure administrators across the state of Texas and across the nation can see that and will work with their students and conserve these awards to make sure that students are safe," he said.</p><p>Paul said following the assassination of Kirk, he is anticipating a similar response for college safety to the response that 9/11 had on airport security. </p><p>Braelunn said, "I truly, I hope that it changes safety. I hope there should be no person, right or left, no matter which side of the spectrum you're on, that should feel threatened for expressing their beliefs."</p><p>Noel said he felt encouraged to continue his mission.</p><p>"The whole situation has definitely been hard," he said. "But at the same time, to see a leader like that who died for something you truly believed in encourages me to go even harder. So the mission keeps going."</p><p><i>Fox News' Alba Cuebas-Fantauzzi contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Trump to give 'tough talk' on globalism 'failures,' while highlighting 'return of American strength' at UNGA</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>President Donald Trump will highlight the "return of American strength" in his second administration during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly Tuesday, while delivering "blunt" and "tough talk" about the "failures of globalism," a White House official told Fox News Digital.</p><p>The president is scheduled to deliver his first address of his second administration at the UN General Assembly in New York City Tuesday just before 10 a.m.</p><p>A White House official gave Fox News Digital an exclusive preview of the president’s address.</p><p>"President Trump has effectively restored American strength on the world stage," a White House official told Fox News Digital. "His historic speech at the United Nations General Assembly will highlight his success in delivering peace on a scale that no other president has accomplished, while simultaneously speaking bluntly about how globalist ideologies risk destroying successful nations around the world."</p><p>The president is expected to highlight his successful efforts to negotiate peace around the world—specifically, Armenia and Azerbaijan; Thailand and Cambodia; Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; among others.</p><p>The president is also expected to highlight his strikes against narcoterrorists from Venezuela.</p><p>Earlier this month, a U.S. military strike blew apart a Venezuelan drug boat in the southern Caribbean, leaving nearly a dozen suspected Tren de Aragua narcoterrorists dead. And last week, the president announced that the U.S. military had carried out its second kinetic strike on Venezuelan drug trafficking cartels.</p><p>Also last week, the president announced that he ordered a lethal strike on a vessel allegedly linked to a designated terrorist organization conducting narcotrafficking in the U.S. Southern Command’s area of responsibility. That strike left three narcoterrorists dead.</p><p>"Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage en route to poison Americans," Trump posted to his Truth Social announcing the strike.</p><p>The president is also expected to highlight his "Operation Midnight Hammer," which marked the largest B-2 operational strike in history and represented the United States’ move to deliver a decisive blow against Iran’s nuclear program back in June.</p><p>Trump’s historic precision strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites hit their targets and "destroyed" and "badly damaged" the facilities’ critical infrastructure—an assessment agreed upon by Iran’s Foreign Ministry, Israel, and the United States.</p><p>Trump is also set to detail his work to "deliver historic peace deals in decades-long conflicts," the official told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Meanwhile, the president’s speech will also feature "some blunt, tough talk about the failures of globalism."</p><p>"This will include the global migration regime, energy and climate, and how these ideologies pushed by globalists are on the verge of destroying successful nations," a White House official told Fox News Digital.</p><p>The president is also expected to discuss America’s position as a "defender of western civilization."</p><p>"As the president delivers peace in major conflicts around the world, what has the United Nations been doing?" the official said.</p><p>After his speech at the United Nations, the president is expected to have meetings with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy; the president of Argentina, Javier Milei; and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.</p><p>The president is also scheduled to have a multilateral meeting with leaders from Qatar, Jordan, Turkey, Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia.  </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Daniel Penny attorney calls progressive policies 'homicidal,' says Charlotte train murder was preventable</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p> One of the lawyers who successfully defended New York City subway hero Daniel Penny is calling out what he terms the "dysfunctional homicidal policies of the radical left," arguing that progressive criminal justice policies that keep violent, mentally ill repeat offenders on the streets lead to preventable tragedies like the recent Charlotte train stabbing in North Carolina.</p><p>"These are homicidal policies," said Thomas Kenniff, a partner at Raiser Kenniff &amp; Lonstein. "If you are unwilling to support criminal justice policies that where circumstances require you have the incarceration or institutionalization of violently dangerous people, understand you're making a choice and you're standing for something that is going to get innocent people like this poor young woman in Charlotte, killed."</p><p>Decarlos Brown Jr., a 34-year-old with a history of mental illness and more than a dozen prior charges, allegedly stabbed 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska in the neck from behind in an unprovoked attack on a light rail train on Aug. 22, according to authorities.</p><p>He was released without bail for a prior misdemeanor charge of allegedly misusing the 911 system.</p><p>"The alleged assailant in this case, my understanding is at least 14 arrests, prior psychiatric commitments, jail sentences — he was able to walk out of that courtroom with, you know, signing a note, 'I promise to come back,'" Kenniff told Fox News Digital. "Daniel Penny, after having served his country for four years in the Marine Corps, attending college, no prior criminal record... we had to post $100,000 bond."</p><p>Kenniff has long warned that the persecution of Penny would put a chilling effect on other potential good Samaritans, who not only have to worry about their personal safety when intervening to stop a violent crime, but may also be afraid of being targeted by left-wing prosecutors.</p><p>Jurors found Penny not guilty of criminally negligent homicide in December, after he put a mentally ill man named Jordan Neely, 30, in a chokehold on a subway car. Neely had schizophrenia, was behaving erratically, high on drugs and threatening riders. He died after the encounter.</p><p>Zarutska, the Charlotte victim, was a refugee who came to the U.S. after fleeing the war in her native Ukraine. Video shows she collapsed to the ground and bled out in front of at least a half-dozen bystanders in an unprovoked stabbing. She was on her way home from work at a pizzeria, looking at her phone from a seat on the train when video shows a man in red open a pocket knife behind her immediately before the stabbing.</p><p>While police statistics show major crimes, including homicides, are on the decline, Kenniff said they don't paint a full picture.</p><p>"The only statistic that should matter is how many preventable, otherwise preventable crimes are occurring," he told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Kenniff noted that even Brown's family wanted him off the streets before the stabbing.</p><p>"From what I've read, his own mother tried to commit him involuntarily and had a judge, whose job it is to uphold the law and collateral to that obviously protect the public, release that person on a note that they'll come back to court," he told Fox News Digital. "And [to] not look at that as a man-made preventable crime — that did not need to occur."</p><p>Brown faces first-degree murder in North Carolina as well as a federal charge of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system.</p><p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday that the Justice Department will seek the maximum penalty for Brown, saying that the Aug. 22 attack was a "direct result of failed soft-on-crime policies that put criminals before innocent people."</p><p>"We will seek the maximum penalty for this unforgivable act of violence," she said. "He will never again see the light of day as a free man."</p><p>Republican lawmakers in North Carolina have also proposed a bill to change how judges set bail and bond, according to the Charlotte News &amp; Observer newspaper.</p><p>The proposed bill, Iryna's Law, would make it harder for people accused of violent crimes to get pretrial release and imposes stricter conditions on them if they make bond. It would also expand the state's authority to have mentally ill people forcibly committed.</p><p><i>Fox News' Sarah Rumpf-Whitten contributed to this report. </i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Democrats likely to chip away at razor-thin House GOP majority in special election showdown</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The special election on Tuesday in Arizona’s 7th Congressional District is widely expected to narrow the GOP’s already slim majority in the U.S. House.</p><p>Democrats enjoy a nearly two-to-one voter registration advantage over Republicans in southern Arizona's left-leaning congressional district, which stretches from Yuma to Tucson and includes almost the entire length of the state's border with Mexico.</p><p>Democratic Pima County Supervisor Adelita Grijalva, the daughter of the late congressman, is facing off in the special election against small business owner and contractor Daniel Butierez, the Republican nominee, with two third-party candidates also on the ballot.</p><p>"In Congress, I commit to fight Trump’s cruel agenda, like the Big Ugly Bill that took away coverage from nearly 383,000 Arizonans and 142,000 children," Grijalva pledged in a social media post, as she took aim at President Donald Trump, congressional Republicans, and their sweeping domestic policy measure.</p><p>Butierez, meanwhile, has been promoting himself as the change candidate in a district controlled by Democrats since the seat was created over two decades ago.</p><p>"This is your chance to actually get a Representative who will represent everyone. If you vote we win, if you don't only the radicals will have representation," he wrote on X.</p><p>The winner will serve out the remaining 15 months of the term of the elder Grijalva, who died in March following complications from cancer treatment.</p><p>Republicans currently control the House 219-213, with three vacant seats. </p><p>Besides Arizona's 7th Congressional District, there's also a vacancy in the Texas 18th Congressional District, a heavily Democrat-dominated district in Houston, following the March death of Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner. The special election to fill the seat will be held on November 4, which is Election Day 2025.</p><p>Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, a right-leaning seat where Republican Rep. Mark Green stepped down in July to take a job in the private sector, is also currently vacant. The special election to fill the seat will be held on December 2.</p><p>In Arizona, the younger Grijalva, thanks in part to her family name and her support from national progressive rock stars Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, grabbed over 60% of the primary vote this summer in a five-candidate showdown.</p><p>Progressive activist and social media influencer Deja Foxx came in a distant second.</p><p>Grajalva, if elected, would become Arizona's first Latina in Congress.</p><p>Butierez, who as the 2024 GOP congressional nominee lost to the elder Grijalva while Trump narrowly carried the southwestern battleground state at the top of the ballot, easily won this summer's Republican primary in the special election.</p><p>While Trump carried Arizona last year after losing it in 2020, 2024 Democratic presidential nominee and then-Vice President Kamala Harris won the district by 23 points. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">MORNING GLORY: How will 'the news' cover Charlie Kirk's service?</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>"How do we cover that?"</p><p>That had to have been the topic on the table at the Monday morning meeting of news network executives, producers and hosts, and probably will be today and for at least a week to come.  </p><p>I hope the producers and hosts have the courage to call it what it was: the most watched Christian service of witness and forgiveness, mourning and testimony as has ever been watched and listened to in history. </p><p>Look past the more than 100,000 people who attended in person and began to line up outside of Phoenix’s State Farm Stadium before dawn, a stadium which filled to the acceptable capacity of 70,000 and left tens of thousands in an adjacent arena or watching on their cellphones. </p><p>I haven’t seen any estimates of U.S. audience or online views, much less the international reach or the audience for clips during the days of echoing that will follow in the virtual world. The numbers will be enormous if there is even any way of compiling them. </p><p>That Sunday would be a unique day of mourning was already widely understood by the end of last week. President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth would be the biggest names among the eulogists, along with the heartfelt tributes of Charlie’s friends and colleagues, teachers (Dr. Larry Arnn, president of Hillsdale College) and older mentors, (Dr. Ben Carson, elder statesman of the politically active evangelical conservative community) and of course, his colleagues at Turning Point USA plus an extraordinary musical backdrop from the world of Christian ministry and superb production values from a tested TPUSA team used to big events. </p><p>But what how will the media describe it?</p><p>Having dipped in and out of covering faith in America since 1990, with a couple of books and documentaries on the subject and a PBS series in 1996, "Searching for God in America," I’m well aware that America’s newsrooms are not overflowing with journalists accustomed to the language of evangelical Christianity of any kind. </p><p>I’m multilingual when it comes to Christianity, describing myself for decades as an evangelical Roman Catholic Presbyterian, as I am a faithful member of Pope Leo XIV’s legions and an ordained elder in the Presbyterian Church, (U.S.A.) — one river, two banks and I’m welcomed on both. I’m just a "mere Christian" as C.S. Lewis put it. Not a theologian, but a lawyer-journalist who has covered world religions and made an effort to keep up with doctrinal arguments within my own, arguments which have consumed most of the past few decades. </p><p>More than 60% of Americans identify as Christians, according to Pew Research Center’s 2023-2024 survey. The world is currently home to more than 2.5 billion Christians. Whatever one makes of the faith, it is the primary shaping force of Western civilization. Whatever one makes of Christianity’s truth claims, Charlie and the vast majority of those who watched Sunday believe them, as I do. </p><p>But, much of post-modern media lacks basic fluency in the language used by many of the speakers Sunday. The vice president and secretaries of State and War made explicit testimonies to their belief in the objective truth of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. </p><p>Trump underscored Charlie’s role as an evangelist. </p><p>Erika Kirk made a heart-breaking and deeply moving public forgiveness of her husband’s assassin —perhaps the hardest of all Christian commandments which Jesus laid down in his famous Sermon on the Mount: "I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven." </p><p>At that moment, Erika Kirk was modeling the words of the first Christian martyr, St. Stephen, as he prayed for his persecutors, even as Jesus did for the Romans crucifying him in Jerusalem 2000 years ago. </p><p>So what is the impact going to be of Charlie’s murder and of his evangelical witness amplified by Sunday and a hundred or a thousand other commentaries like this one?</p><p>I don’t know and it would be foolish to guess. Here is an example of why. </p><p>The Christian view is a large one and its timelines are not "news cycles." This year, for example, I had occasion to worship in an old Baptist church in Maine that had commissioned George Dana Boardman —"Apostle to the Karens" (yes, an actual ethic group in Myanmar) in 1825. </p><p>Boardman and his wife took ship to Calcutta 200 years ago, then on to what was then deemed Burma, learned the language for two years and spent three to four years evangelizing the people before George died of tuberculosis. An unremarkable life of a forgotten Christian missionary? Hardly. </p><p>There are hundreds, if not thousands, of "Karen congregations" around the world because of a missionary’s efforts 200 years ago. The Karen Baptist Convention (KBC) is a major denomination in Myanmar and a reliable source for figures there. More than a decade ago, the KBC included 1,829 churches with a membership of over 287,000 in Myanmar with hundreds more congregations in Thailand. There are hundreds of such churches in the US alone. George Boardman’s mission was unnoticed by most at the time. I doubt even many American Baptist Church folk know of him today. Religious "coaching trees" are very difficult to trace. But they are everywhere. </p><p>Point being: Nobody has any idea what Charlie’s life and his memorial service will mean in the hearts and minds of millions who watched it and how their lives will change as a result and thus change the lives of others. </p><p>But reporting on the size of the outreach is a start and asking authorities on faith for their assessment is so much more interesting and compelling than trying to smash the story into a "political" or "cultural box." </p><p>The "world-wide religious impact" box of stories doesn’t get taken off the shelf very often — deaths of popes and conclaves are one of the few occasions that come to mind — but, the uniqueness of the Christian celebration of the life of Charlie Kirk ought to draw the attention of serious people. </p><p>There are hundreds of experts on whom networks and news platforms of all sorts can rely who are close at hand: Dr. Albert Mohler, Bishop Robert Barron, former Senator Ben Sasse and perhaps even Pope Leo XIV could be approached for assessment and comment.  </p><p>What I expect is that most news organizations will flee the scene or force it into a political moment because Charlie was assassinated for overtly political causes in a time of increasing political violence. </p><p>But the "story" is one that Christians routinely refer to as "the greatest story ever told" and one which we believe to be objectively true. Bravo to the outlets with the courage to grapple with the most consequential part of Charlie Kirk’s life: His impact on the infinite timeline of millions of human souls. </p><p><i>Hugh Hewitt is host of "The Hugh Hewitt Show," heard weekday mornings 6am to 9am ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>CNN’s Abby Phillip said Saturday that liberals need to "actively acknowledge" their role in pushing cancel culture and censorship if they want the nation to move forward.</p><p>The "Table for Five" host and her panel discussed ABC’s suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel after he made controversial comments regarding Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin, which triggered backlash from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and two major broadcast affiliate owners. </p><p>Though Phillip criticized Republicans for celebrating despite their push for free speech, she agreed with another panelist who argued liberals have been, by contrast, "too censorious" in the past. </p><p>"I think that’s something more liberals should say," Phillip said. "I think it would help. They should acknowledge, not just in passing, but actively acknowledge where things went wrong. That’s the only way to move forward, I think, in a way."</p><p>When asked what liberals should admit, Phillip said they must recognize that cancel culture was an issue before Kimmel’s suspension.</p><p>"It was actually a thing, and it’s not just enough to say, well, my cancel culture was fine, but yours is wrong," Phillip said. "There has to be an acknowledgment that, yeah, now I think everybody understands what free speech really looks like and what it means, and then you have to apply that thinking to what was happening four, five, six years ago in this country and say something about it."</p><p>CNN political commentator and former Biden official Ashley Allison disagreed with Phillip, saying that, unlike Republicans, a Democratic president did not attempt to "cancel" somebody.</p><p>"Joe Biden wasn’t canceling somebody, Kamala Harris wasn’t canceling. It might’ve been individual citizens, and individual citizens actually have the ability to say, ‘I don’t like it’ and let their dollars, let their viewership, let their subscriptions [decide]," Allison said.</p><p>Liberals and media commentators have attacked ABC and parent company Disney’s decision to suspend Kimmel’s show, claiming that they had capitulated to the Trump administration and its FCC to silence a Trump critic.</p><p>Though some conservative commentators celebrated Kimmel’s suspension, others expressed caution about potential government overreach.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">SEAN DUFFY: Trump's crime crackdown is giving Democratic leaders a blueprint to follow</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The deadly stabbing of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte’s light rail last month demonstrates everything President Donald Trump has warned about violent crime.</p><p>The 34-year-old suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., had previously been arrested an astonishing 14 times. This career criminal, however, had been free to roam the streets thanks to Democrats controlling law enforcement in Charlotte at every level. Victims like Zarutska are sacrificed when crime goes unpunished. </p><p>As President Donald Trump’s transportation secretary, I've seen firsthand how leadership can transform chaos into order. From building an all-new air traffic control system to cleaning up D.C.’s Union Station, we've proven American decline isn’t inevitable; it’s a choice. Nowhere is this clearer than in the fight against crime. So I formally launched an investigation into the Charlotte transportation authorities’ safety and security plans. But we’re not just looking at North Carolina.</p><p>Anarchy has infected transit networks everywhere. Americans see it every day. But Trump’s decisive actions in Washington, D.C., demonstrate how, with the right policies, we can reclaim our cities from the grip of disorder. We will not sit by and wait for the next Iryna. That’s why today, I’ve also reminded leaders in Boston and Chicago that federal dollars come with strings attached. If local leaders want federal funding, they will meet federal safety standards. The status quo is unacceptable. America’s patience has run out.</p><p>Just last month, the president declared an emergency in our nation's capital, surging federal law enforcement officers to restore public safety. It was a direct response to skyrocketing crime rates that turned D.C. into a symbol of urban failure under years of Democratic mismanagement. By tapping agencies like the FBI, DEA and U.S. Marshals, and even deploying the National Guard, Trump showed crime isn't unstoppable — it's a policy failure to be reversed.</p><p>The results speak for themselves: within weeks, violent crime dropped, encampments cleared and even D.C.'s Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser admitted the federal presence has helped. Trump's approach underscores a fundamental truth: crime and urban decay are choices. Leftist policies which prioritize criminals over victims — defunding police, lax prosecution and tolerance for open-air drug markets — have turned once-vibrant cities into war zones.</p><p>Homelessness, too, isn't just a social ill; it's exacerbated by the same permissive attitudes that allow tents to block sidewalks and public parks to become havens for addiction and disorder. Trump's surge in Washington proves cracking down on debauchery and prioritizing public order can turn the tide.</p><p>Even some Democrats are starting to realize this reality. Take Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, whose state has been plagued by Baltimore crime. For weeks, Moore sparred with the president over offers to send in the National Guard, calling the president's rhetoric "performative" while waving off federal help. Yet, just days ago, Moore did an about-face, ordering additional state police into Baltimore to fight local crime. He welcomed support from agencies like the FBI but drew the line at the Guard — perhaps to save face politically. Baltimore is a prime example of how blue-city policies have failed: high homicide rates, rampant drug use and homelessness that spills into streets, driving businesses and families away. Moore's move, while belated, implicitly concedes Trump's point: on-the-ground reinforcements work. If a leftist like Moore can admit the truth, why can't others?</p><p>It's time for accountability. Trump's surge in D.C. isn't just a win for the capital; it's a blueprint for the nation. Governors like Moore are quietly adopting it because the American people have been force-fed blue pills long enough. Minorities are not falling for the routine lie that crime cannot be lowered, while Republicans who are trying to fix the problem are unrepentant racists. There’s a reason Trump nearly doubled his support among Black voters last fall and increased the Hispanic share by a third since 2020. They are waking up and liberal politicians had better wake up soon. Blue-state leaders must choose: continue enabling chaos, or follow Trump's lead and make safety a priority. Our cities deserve better than excuses. They deserve action.</p><p>As we rebuild America's infrastructure under this administration, let's remember that safe streets are the foundation of prosperity. Crime is a blue pill choice — and it's one we can reject.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">LIZ PEEK: Trump sets trap for Democrats on crime, and they’re walking right into it</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Do Democrats really want to repeat their humiliating defeat of 1988? They might if they continue putting criminals ahead of citizens. President Donald Trump will make sure of it.</p><p>President Trump, whose political instincts are excellent (witness his turns serving fries at McDonald’s or driving a garbage truck during last year’s campaign), is pushing clueless Democrats into a trap. By sending the National Guard into Washington, D.C., and cleaning up our nation’s capital, he has shown what is possible. By resisting his offers to help their cities, Democratic officials in Illinois, California, New York and other blue states are telling their residents they care more about criminals than the people they represent. They will pay for that.</p><p>In the presidential election of 1988, Republican George H.W. Bush crushed his Democratic rival, winning 426 Electoral College votes to Michael Dukakis’ 111 — one of the worst drubbings of all time.</p><p>Bush portrayed his rival as soft on crime. The Republican nominee ran an infamous and highly effective TV ad saying Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis "…allowed first-degree murderers to have weekend passes from prison." One example that was highlighted was Willie Horton, who murdered a boy in a robbery, stabbing him 19 times. Despite a life sentence, Horton received 10 weekend passes from prison. Horton fled, kidnapped a young couple, stabbing the man and repeatedly raped his girlfriend. The ad concluded: "Weekend prison passes — Dukakis on crime."</p><p>Some say the ad, which also featured a chilling photo of Horton, changed the course of criminal justice in America, leading to more than a decade of ‘tough on crime’ policies.</p><p>Bill Keller, editor-in-chief of The Marshall Project, a group dedicated to criminal justice reform, said the ad "taught Democrats that this was an issue where they had to be more Catholic than the Pope; tougher than tough." </p><p>Six years later, President Bill Clinton followed through by signing the 1994 Crime Bill, which called for nearly $10 billion to build more prisons and add 100,000 police officers. The bill was largely written by Delaware Democrat, then-Sen. Joe Biden. </p><p>Democrats have forgotten the lesson of 1988. They argue that after a spike during the post-COVID years, crime is down, but voters aren’t buying it. A recent AP poll shows two-thirds of Americans think crime is a major problem. Some 81% see it as a major concern in cities, including 96% of Republicans and even 68% of Democrats.</p><p>Bottom line: After decades of backing crime-busting policies and watching the number of violent offenses drop, Democrats have gone soft again.</p><p>Led by former President Joe Biden, they have worked to reverse the impact of the 1994 bill, endorsing cashless bail, shielding juveniles from being charged as adults for even the most heinous crimes, and allowing petty criminals to get off scot-free.</p><p>Some, like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, also advocate closing prisons. Asked in 2020 whether he thought prisons were obsolete, then-New York state Assemblyman Mamdani replied: "I think that frankly — I mean — what purpose do they serve? I think that we have to ask ourselves that." </p><p>Newsom has already closed four prisons in California and wants to shutter a fifth, despite more than two-thirds of voters approving Proposition 36, a measure demanding tougher treatment and longer sentences for certain crimes.</p><p>Democratic officials in cities like New York make it nearly impossible for cops to do their jobs, discouraging law enforcement by releasing repeat offenders back onto the streets, all but encouraging them to reoffend.</p><p>The breakdown of law and order is promoted by judges who side with criminals and district attorneys who refuse to prosecute crimes. Judges like New York’s Jeffrey Gershuny, an appointee of Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio, recently released—defying prosecutors’ requests—a criminal on parole who had already been arrested 34 times for robbery. Thirty-four! And D.A.s like Alvin Bragg, who, on his first day in office, published a long list of offenses he would ignore, including fare-skipping, trespassing, resisting arrest and prostitution.</p><p>In protesting Bragg’s announcement, the head of New York’s police union said, "There are already too many people who believe that they can commit crimes, resist arrest, interfere with police officers and face zero consequences."</p><p>Democrats are committing the gravest of political sins: not listening to their voters. In Chicago, Brandon Johnson was elected mayor two years ago in a race dominated by concerns about safety; 71% of voters listed crime as their top issue, far outranking jobs or anything else. Despite his previous "defund the police" rhetoric and promises to cut law enforcement spending, Johnson won.</p><p>Today, he and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker are refusing President Trump’s offer to help rein in Chicago’s horrific crime. Johnson recently argued, "Jails and incarceration and law enforcement is a sickness that has not led to safe communities." No wonder he has the lowest approval rating of any mayor in the U.S.</p><p>He’s not alone in sounding foolish. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, says committing a crime does not make someone a criminal, while colleague Rep. Jamie Raskin. D-Md., says he opposes Trump’s crackdown because "crime has always been part of our history." Does that comfort the victims?</p><p>In 2028, the GOP candidate for president could well repeat history by running an ad showing the horrifying murder of Iryna Zarutska, the Ukrainian refugee who sought safety in the United States only to be fatally stabbed by suspected assailant Decarlos Brown Jr. Brown had been arrested at least 14 times and had served time for crimes including felony larceny, armed robbery and assault. He also has a history of mental illness.</p><p>Voters will ask: Why was he not locked up? Why did Zarutska have to die because woke judges and prosecutors prioritized their social justice crusade over her life? </p><p>Just as in 1988, Democrats will have no answers.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Why ABC brings back Jimmy Kimmel today after its debacle over free speech</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>In the end, Disney and ABC had absolutely no choice but to rehire Jimmy Kimmel.</p><p>The reason the late-night host is returning to the air tonight is that this whole thing has been an utter PR debacle for ABC, and more personally for Disney chief Bob Iger, who even got whacked by his predecessor as CEO, Michael Eisner, accusing him of bowing to "out-of-control intimidation."</p><p>I don’t think I’m going out on a limb in saying that Iger’s reputation is shattered forever.</p><p>The company became the poster child as a high-profile opponent of free speech — a deadly label for a news organization like ABC.</p><p>So the "indefinite" suspension is over.</p><p>I could sniff that things were moving in this direction when I learned the two sides were talking. And when Disney asked Kimmel for a second meeting the other day, I knew the only question was which day he’d be back.</p><p>Let’s revisit the dumb and inaccurate comment that got Kimmel in trouble. And remember, like Stephen Colbert, he is so vociferously anti-Trump that he surrendered half his audience:</p><p>"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them."  </p><p>First, it was beyond tone-deaf, with feelings rubbed so raw over Charlie Kirk’s assassination. And the killer is not "MAGA," just another crazed lunatic who said he was acting out of "hatred" for Kirk, but also sympathetic to gays and transgender people like his roommate and romantic partner.</p><p>At the same time, there was pressure from the FCC, with Chairman Brendan Carr blundering by saying he would act on Kimmel if ABC didn’t. Even Carr’s allies, like Ted Cruz, said he sounded like a mob boss by declaring "we can do it the easy way or the hard way."Nice little network you got here – be a shame if anything happened to it. Carr walked it back the next day.</p><p>What Kimmel said wasn’t the worst thing ever uttered on the air, and maybe in a month it would have passed unnoticed. But not so soon after the targeted assassination.</p><p>With that kind of blatant government pressure, ABC caved and took Kimmel off the air as he was about to tape last Wednesday’s show – and was said to be preparing an even tougher monologue about the Kirk killer. Again, he failed to read the electronic room.</p><p>It was downhill from there.</p><p>For anyone who believes in free speech – and that includes some Democrats who don’t agree with Kirk on just about anything–Disney and ABC were now the enemy.</p><p>Howard Stern, Kimmel’s closest friend – their families vacation together – said yesterday he had canceled his Disney+ subscription, as did Robin Quivers. After conferring with Kimmel, he said on his first live show since the suspension:</p><p>"When the government says, 'I'm not pleased with you, so we're going to orchestrate a way to silence you,' it's the wrong direction for our country. It isn't good."</p><p>Stern called the suspension "horrible" and "outrageous" for such a "big talent… You can't support this kind of a move. I don't care whether you like Jimmy or not. It's about freedom of speech. If ABC wanted to fire Jimmy because they didn't like him, or he had low ratings — they didn't want to fire him. They're being pressured by the United States government. We can't have that, not if we're going to have a democracy."</p><p>Howard has an awful lot of followers on Sirius XM that would take their cue from him. </p><p>Some 400 celebrities signed an ACLU letter calling this "a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation." These include Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman, Robert De Niro, Jane Fonda, Selena Gomez, Tom Hanks, Olivia Rodrigo, Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Keaton, Regina King, Diego Luna, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Natalie Portman, Maya Rudolph, Martin Short and Kerry Washington.</p><p>This is the kind of thing that Hollywood really cares about, the bold-faced names.</p><p>Kimmel is said to be concerned about the jobs of dozens of producers, staff members and contractors who would lose their livelihoods if the show was deep-sixed.</p><p>Disney made a point of saying in its statement that Kimmel was suspended because "we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive." But "thoughtful" conversations led to Jimmy’s return.</p><p>Whether you like Kimmel or not, no company can withstand that kind of pressure, even if it goes against the wishes of Donald Trump, who celebrated the suspension.</p><p>Now here’s the challenge Kimmel and Disney/ABC faced.</p><p>The suits had already been urging Kimmel to tone down the attacks against Trump. But Kimmel, who has hosted the program since 2003, and parlayed that into Oscars-hosting gigs, has always insisted on his independence. He’s arguably the most famous face at the network.</p><p>I played a small role in this last year by asking Trump about Kimmel after the Oscars, and the candidate slammed him, escalating their feud. Jimmy even took a swipe at me (horrors).</p><p>So perhaps with a wink and a nod, Kimmel has now agreed to tone things down a tad and the brass has agreed to let him basically say what’s on his mind.</p><p>Jimmy Kimmel is the only clear winner in this.</p><p>Everyone else – Disney, Bob Iger, Brendan Carr, ABC – is unmistakably a loser and will forever be branded, fairly or otherwise, as cowardly opponents of free speech.</p><p>And hey, ratings for tonight’s show should be through the roof. </p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Monday for her first interview since her loss to Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. </p><p>Harris, 60, didn’t hold back, calling her Republican opponent a "tyrant" and lambasting American CEOs for, what she deemed, capitulation to Trump. </p><p>"I worked closely with the private sector over many years, and I always believed that if push came to shove, those titans of industry would be guardrails for our democracy, for the importance of sustaining democratic institutions," Harris said. "And one by one by one, they have been silent. They have been, you know, yes, I use the word feckless." </p><p>Harris ridiculed the idea that the billionaire class would lose their yacht or their house in the Hamptons if they spoke out against Trump. She argued that capitalism thrives better under democracy than under authoritarian regimes. </p><p>"Democracy sustains capitalism. Capitalism thrives in a democracy. And right now, we are dealing with – as I called him at my speech on the ellipse – a tyrant. We used to compare the strength of our democracy to communist dictators. That's what we're dealing with right now under Donald Trump. And these titans of industry are not speaking up," she said. </p><p>Harris said she understood their hesitancy to speak out against the president, noting that his administration has gone after his critics. </p><p>"But at some point, they’ve got to stand up for the sake of the people who rely on all of these institutions to have integrity and to at some point be the guardrails against a tyrant who is using the federal government to execute his whim and fancy because of a fragile ego," Harris said. </p><p>Monday night’s interview on MSNBC came a day before the release of her new book, "107 Days," which will recount her tumultuous experience replacing former President Joe Biden as the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee after he dropped out of the race. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Lions sack Lamar Jackson 7 times while rushing for 225 yards in win over Ravens</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Detroit Lions went into Baltimore on Monday night and came away with a high-scoring victory, 38-30, over the Ravens. </p><p>The Lions moved to 2-1, while the Ravens are now 1-2 after faltering late in this game. </p><p>Being that these are two of the most explosive offenses in the NFL to start the new year, it was expected to be a shootout at M&amp;T Bank Stadium, and that’s exactly what football fans got from the Ravens and Lions. </p><p>It was Detroit getting on the board first with its opening drive, going 11 plays and 67 yards with Jahmyr Gibbs finding the end zone for the first time on the night with a one-yard run. But the Ravens’ opening-drive script was even better thanks to their Pro Bowl running back. </p><p>Derrick Henry, who had just 23 yards rushing in the win over the Cleveland Browns last week, broke that mark with a 28-yard touchdown run to even the score after the extra point. </p><p>After punts by both teams on their next drives, the Lions found themselves on their own two-yard line late in the first quarter. Baltimore was hoping to make it a quick punt given the circumstances, but Detroit was simply better at the line of scrimmage as they stayed true to the run game and managed to go 98 yards in 18 plays for a touchdown. </p><p>It was David Montgomery, Gibbs’ counterpart in the backfield, punching it in to cap a drive that took just under 11 minutes of first-half clock off the board to make it 14-7. </p><p>It appeared momentum would totally be on the Lions’ sideline, especially after being able to stop the Ravens near the goal line on four tries to get a turnover on downs. However, Lamar Jackson and company were able to tie things at 14 apiece with 24 seconds left in the second quarter after Rashod Bateman was found wide open in the front of the end zone. </p><p>As the second half began, Baltimore got right to work, going 11 plays and 73 yards where Jackson threw a seed to tight end Mark Andrews for the touchdown lead. But just like in the first half, Detroit had the answer with a touchdown of their own, as Goff placed the ball perfectly to Amon-Ra St. Brown, who was streaking down the right sideline into the end zone. </p><p>At 21 apiece entering the fourth quarter, and both offenses clearly clicking, this game felt like it was going to come down to the wire. The Lions got their lead back after a gadget play on fourth-and-1 from the Baltimore four-yard line, as St. Brown flipped it back to Gibbs for the score. </p><p>The Ravens were able to get a field goal and a timely punt, as they had 8:31 left in the fourth quarter and a four-point deficit to overcome. But Henry fumbled on the first play, as Aidan Hutchinson punched the ball out from behind. </p><p>Luckily, a facemask penalty by a Lions offensive lineman stalled a potential game-sealing drive, with Detroit forced to have Jake Bates nail a field goal to get their seven-point lead back. </p><p>Jackson and the Ravens needed another answering score, but the Lions’ defense was relentless and forced a three-and-out as the defensive front just kept getting Jackson down to the turf – something we’re certainly not used to seeing. </p><p>The Lions were able to sack Jackson seven times, with Al-Quadin Muhammad getting 2.5, while Hutchinson, Derrick Barnes, Trevor Nowaske and Jack Campbell each tallied one. </p><p>Detroit had the opportunity to seal their victory after forcing the punt, and they didn’t just get necessary first downs. Montgomery, who led the game with 151 yards rushing on 12 carries went 31 yards to the house to make it a 38-24 game. </p><p>The Lions also went for it on fourth down the play prior to the score, with Goff placing another great pass for St. Brown to not only keep the drive going, but not give Jackson the ball at midfield. Goff finished the game 20-of-28 for 202 yards with St. Brown leading the Lions with 77 yards on seven catches. </p><p>Detroit also had 225 rushing yards, with Gibbs going for 67 on 22 carries while also catching five passes for 32 yards. </p><p>For the Ravens, they had a touchdown drive with just seconds left on the clock, but it was too little too late in the end. </p><p>Jackson finished 21-of-27 for 288 yards with three touchdown passes, two of which going to Andrews who led the game with 91 receiving yards on six catches. Henry was held to just 50 yards on 12 carries as well. </p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital’s </i><i>, and subscribe to </i><i>.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris offered a lukewarm endorsement for New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in a Monday interview.</p><p>Harris sat down with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow for an interview where they discussed her new book "107 Days," which will release on Tuesday. Maddow highlighted a portion of Harris’ book that discussed the former VP’s "stars project," where she met with and identified rising stars in the Democratic Party.</p><p>Maddow asked Harris for her opinion on the socialist candidate as a rising star and whether she supported him.</p><p>"Look, as far as I’m concerned, he’s the Democratic nominee, and he should be supported," Harris began.</p><p>"Do you endorse his candidacy?" Maddow pressed.</p><p>"I support the Democrat in the race, sure," Harris said. </p><p>Harris quickly followed by saying that Mamdani was not the only "star" in the Democratic Party and hoped people would pay attention to other races throughout the country.</p><p>"But I mean, there are people like Barbara Drummond in Mobile, Alabama, Helena Moreno in New Orleans. They’re all running for mayor, too, and they are stars. So, I hope that we don’t so over index on New York City that we lose sight of the stars throughout our country who are right now running for mayor and many other offices, governor and so on. So that’s where I am. We got a big tent, and we got a lot of stars," Harris said.</p><p>Despite being the Democratic candidate for New York City mayor, Mamdani has yet to receive endorsements from major party leaders such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, both of whom also represent New York.</p><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul endorsed Mamdani on Sept. 14 after three months.</p><p>"New York City deserves a mayor who will stand up to Donald Trump and make life more affordable for New Yorkers. That’s @ZohranKMamdani," Hochul wrote on social media.</p><p>Mamdani has faced criticism from more moderate Democrats for his progressive proposals, such as city-owned grocery stores and his refusal to condemn the anti-Israel slogan "globalize the intifada."</p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Wild video released by the Prince George’s County Police Department shows what officers describe as "illegal car takeovers" that have been causing chaos in Maryland.</p><p>The aerial footage captures dozens of people standing within feet of cars spinning wildly at high speeds in places like shopping center parking lots.</p><p>The video landed amid an ongoing political battle over crime in Maryland.</p><p>Gov. Wes Moore has invited President Donald Trump to take part in a "safety walk" in Baltimore to highlight crime-reduction efforts.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, has criticized Moore, accusing him of failing in public safety and posted on Truth Social in August that he would send in the troops.</p><p>"After only one week, there is NO CRIME AND NO MURDER IN DC! When it is like that in Baltimore, I will proudly ‘walk the streets’ with the failing, because of Crime, Governor of Maryland. P.S. Baltimore is ranked the 4th WORST CITY IN THE NATION IN CRIME &amp; MURDER," the president wrote.</p><p>The release of the footage also came as local police charged 18-year-old Naef Salmo of Millersville in connection with a crash that seriously injured a woman during one of these types of car takeovers.</p><p>Authorities said the incident happened around 1:45 a.m. on Sept. 14 at a shopping center on the 8500 block of Landover Road.</p><p>Investigators allege Salmo was spinning his car in circles when he struck a spectator. Instead of stopping, police say, he fled the scene, leaving the victim behind.</p><p>She was hospitalized with serious injuries but has since been released. Detectives later identified Salmo and located the vehicle.</p><p>According to police, he attempted to cover his tracks by spray-painting the car a different color.

Additional charges may still be filed as the investigation continues.</p><p>"We know these illegal vehicle takeovers may seem harmless to some, but the fact is, they can be dangerous," Prince George’s County Police Chief George Nader said in a statement.</p><p>"In this case, a young woman suffered serious injuries. We’ve also investigated a fatal shooting at a car takeover in recent years," he added.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Prince George's County Police for further comment.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A Colorado jury has ordered a local theme park and others to pay $205 million to the family of a 6-year-old girl who fell more than 100 feet to her death from a ride.</p><p>The verdict, issued Friday at Garfield County District Court, is among the largest wrongful death awards for a single plaintiff in state history.</p><p>Wongel Estifanos, from Colorado Springs, was visiting Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park with her family over Labor Day weekend in 2021 when tragedy struck on the Haunted Mine Drop.</p><p>Investigation paperwork reviewed by Fox News Digital shows Estifanos was not buckled into her seat properly before the ride started.</p><p>Instead, she was seated on top of still-buckled restraints that had been left by a previous rider. Even though a warning alarm sounded, an operator overrode the system and started the ride, according to the documents.</p><p>The Haunted Mine Drop, which was the first drop ride of its kind to plunge riders underground, dropped passengers 110 feet into a darkened shaft. Riders used to sit together on a bench-like seat in a dim chamber. </p><p>After being secured with seat belts, the lights would go out and the attraction would simulate a ghostly presence sending them plummeting downward in total darkness. </p><p>The freefall ended with glowing lanterns illuminating the mine walls before riders were brought back to the loading platform.</p><p>Following the 2021 incident, the Haunted Mine Drop was permanently closed. </p><p>"For four long years, Glenwood Caverns has denied fault for the death of Wongel, who was dropped ten stories to her death from a ride. Wongel’s parents took this case to trial to prove what really happened and to try to save others," Caplis added.</p><p>According to court documents, the family’s 2022 lawsuit alleged not only operator negligence, but also that Glenwood Caverns ignored repeated customer complaints about unsafe practices on the ride.</p><p>Investigators also concluded that multiple staff errors led to Estifanos’ death, including failing to prepare the seat belts before boarding began.</p><p>Glenwood Caverns marketing director Kimberly Marcum said in a statement that co-defendant Soaring Eagle Inc. had "manufactured the Haunted Mine Drop with a defective restraint system that caused this heartbreaking accident."</p><p>Marcum also indicated the manufacturer had certified the attraction as safe despite a defective restraint system. </p><p>"Our hearts go out to the family of Wongel Estifanos," Marcum said, while stating Glenwood Caverns was "exploring all options so that we can attempt to continue to operate, serve our guests, and continue to give back to the community."</p><p>Prosecutors declined to pursue criminal charges against Glenwood Caverns, citing challenges in proving manslaughter, but the civil trial gave Estifanos' family its day in court.</p><p>"They are grateful to the people of Garfield County for being so kind to them during this long trial," added Caplis in his statement.</p><p>Fox News Digital also contacted Soaring Eagle Inc for comment, but did not hear back.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>A new study from Media Research Center’s NewsBusters shows that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" had a strong liberal bias, with conservatives bearing the brunt of 92% of the late-night host’s political jokes while Democrats were largely spared. </p><p>An analysis of 7,797 political jokes across 369 episodes found that Republicans, Trump allies and right-leaning media outlets were overwhelmingly targeted, while liberal figures and networks were rarely mocked.</p><p>More specifically, right-leaning people were the subject of 7,189 jokes, compared to 565 about left-leaning figures and 43 that took aim at nonpartisan targets.</p><p>At the same time, the findings showed only one Democrat – former President Joe Biden – made the list of Kimmel's top ten favorite targets, with 336 instances.</p><p>President Donald Trump ranked first on Kimmel's list, with 3,584 jokes at his expense.</p><p>Other Republicans and Trump affiliates who made the list include former New York Rep. George Santos, First Lady Melania Trump, former DOGE lead Elon Musk, MAGA supporters and more.</p><p>NewsBusters also reported that 97% (61 out of 63) of Kimmel's guests since Sept. 2022 have been liberals.</p><p>The findings come after Kimmel's show was indefinitely suspended over remarks the late-night host made in the wake of Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk's assassination. </p><p>Amid pressure from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Disney confirmed the decision to Fox News Digital last week after the host accused conservatives of reaching "new lows" by trying to affiliate Kirk's alleged assassin, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, with left-wing ideology, despite prosecutors reaffirming those ties during his indictment.</p><p>"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it," Kimmel said.</p><p>Nexstar Media Group, which owns hundreds of television stations, announced earlier it would preempt Kimmel's show on its ABC affiliates starting last Wednesday night "for the foreseeable future" and replace it with other programming over his comments about Robinson.</p><p>"Mr. Kimmel’s comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views or values of the local communities in which we are located," Nexstar's broadcasting chief Andrew Alford said in a press release.  </p><p>"Continuing to give Mr. Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time, and we have made the difficult decision to preempt his show in an effort to let cooler heads prevail as we move toward the resumption of respectful, constructive dialogue." </p><p>Late-night hosts, celebrities and some lawmakers have rallied behind Kimmel after his suspension, arguing that the FCC and the Trump administration have hindered free speech rights with their influence on the matter.</p><p>Some Republicans, including Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, have been critical of the development as well, raising First Amendment concerns.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Disney, ABC's parent company, for comment but did not immediately receive a response. </p><p><i>Fox News' Joseph A.

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>The Department of Homeland Security is criticizing Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker for failing to assist in responding to a chaotic anti-ICE riot in a Chicago suburb that forced federal authorities to deploy tear gas and other non-lethal measures.</p><p>In a Monday statement, the department claimed that police "under JB Pritzker’s sanctuary jurisdiction refused to answer multiple calls for assistance."</p><p>Fox News Digital reported last Friday that federal officials clashed with a group of protesters who were blocking ICE vehicles from entering and exiting a processing facility in Broadview, Illinois.</p><p>DHS labeled the protesters "rioters" and said that so far, federal law enforcement has arrested 16 rioters. The agency said that the "rioters and sanctuary politicians obstructed law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, rocks, bottles, and fireworks, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property." DHS said that rioters also assaulted law enforcement officials.</p><p>Matt Hill, a spokesperson for Pritzker, responded by telling Fox News Digital that "it's completely false to suggest the state or local municipalities have been obstructing federal officials." </p><p>"The state has not received multiple calls for assistance from the federal government and would remind them of the importance of coordinating with local law enforcement to protect public safety," said Hill. He added, "Governor Pritzker has been clear that violence is unacceptable and everyone needs to follow the law, which includes federal agents respecting constitutional rights to peaceful protest."</p><p>"The media needs to use extreme caution before reporting what the Trump administration is saying given their record of lies, lack of transparency, and failure to coordinate with the state and local law enforcement," said Hill. </p><p>The DHS statement said the protest disrupted an operation targeting "some of the worst of the worst—including criminals convicted of drug trafficking, domestic abuse, drinking and driving, and assault," who were being processed at the facility.</p><p>The agency highlighted some of the criminal illegals who were being processed when the protest broke out.</p><p>Among those was Andres Ventura-Uvaldo, a criminal illegal and Mexican national, who the agency said was previously arrested for felony DUI and domestic violence.</p><p>Another, Alberto Algeria Barron, also a Mexican national, was previously removed from the U.S. in 2014 and was convicted for domestic battery twice, according to DHS.</p><p>Erwin Jose Roa-Mustafa, an illegal alien from the Dominican Republic, was also being processed at the facility after pleading guilty on federal charges of conspiracy and intent to distribute a controlled substance and possession with intent to distribute fentanyl.</p><p>DHS said that ICE was also processing another alleged drug trafficker, Ibis Alberto Testa Nunez, from Mexico, who was previously arrested by the Drug Enforcement Administration for cocaine possession and possession with intent to distribute.</p><p>Two others, Salvador Alcantar-Alcantar, from Mexico, was previously arrested for DUI, trespassing and assault, and Carlos Eduardo Chavez-Cardenas, from Bolivia, was previously convicted for DUI and possession of drugs, according to DHS. </p><p>"These heinous criminals, including domestic abusers, drug traffickers, violent offenders, and drunk drivers are some of the illegal aliens being held in the ICE Broadview Processing Center," said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.</p><p>"These rioters in Illinois are fighting to keep rapists, murderers, and other violent criminals loose on Illinois streets," said McLaughlin. "Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers who every single day wake up and make our communities safer."</p><p>This comes as DHS says that ICE officials are facing a more than 1,000 percent increase in assaults as they conduct operations across Illinois. </p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-title">Mourners reflect on Charlie Kirk’s legacy: ‘He went into the literal lion's den on a regular basis’</div>
<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Supporters of Charlie Kirk who are mourning his assassination are reflecting on his legacy and how it can be preserved.</p><p>"He was a rare talent in that he went into the literal lion's den on a regular basis," Christopher Jackson told Fox News Digital Sunday outside the Turning Point USA headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona. </p><p>"He made it his life purpose to go into the lion's den and civilly, in a time when a lot of it is not civil, to civilly have conversation with the other side, especially the impressionable young that are taught the complete opposite of what he felt and somehow in a relatively small amount of time turned it into where it was a crowd that was there to bash on him to where the crowd was mostly there to see him," Jackson added. </p><p>As mourners walked up to the Turning Point USA headquarters to pay their respects, they were greeted by a woman who owns a pop-up florist business and brought donated roses, baby’s breath, and other flowers so that each person could make their own bouquet in memory of Kirk. </p><p>"My brother donated 300, and then I allowed other people to give because in giving we receive," Terrie Overstreet, who runs The Flower Bus by Terrie, told Fox News Digital. </p><p>She said that her family donated flowers so that she could fill her blue and white 1964 Vintage Volkswagen bus with donated flowers for people to make bouquets. </p><p>"So I opened that up to the rest of my family and to my boyfriend's family and that they completed my goal, which was to fill the bus and so the bus is filled with family," Overstreet added. "And yeah, and I'd love to be able to say these are blossoms of blessings for Charlie."</p><p>Mourners from across the country visited Kirk’s headquarters to pay their respects, and leave flowers, notes, candles, and other mementos of appreciation to honor the 31-year-old co-founder and CEO of Turning Point USA, who was shot and killed Sept. 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University during his American Comeback Tour.</p><p>Even though Kirk was one of the youngest conservative leaders in the country, he had quickly become a defining influence in the movement and was a crucial figure in President Donald Trump's 2024 election victory. He founded Turning Point USA in 2012 as an 18-year-old with encouragement from Tea Party activist Bill Montgomery.</p><p>The key to having Kirk’s legacy live on is to live how he lived, Jackson said. </p><p>I’m just hoping I feel like more and more people are learning to not be silent," Jackson said. "And I think that's the answer to not be pushovers and to speak our mind and stand for what we believe like he did. And if anything I feel like that's the lasting legacy he left was to stand up for what you believe and not sheepishly let a lot of the ideology that the left espouses become the norm." </p><p>Ryan Elwood, who also spent time outside Turning Point USA’s headquarters to pay tribute, said that Kirk was a fair and honest communicator. </p><p>"He really brought to light truth, justice, and facts, and that was one of the big things that the world needs to hear is the facts and the truth behind the issues, and once you have the facts, the truth, you should be able to make your own opinion from there," Elwood said. "And I think he was very good about keeping it as unbiased as possible and making people come to their own conclusions." </p><p>Joel Freda told Fox News Digital that those who believed in Kirk’s mission must make it theirs in order for his legacy to endure. </p><p>"I think it's gonna take everybody that ever was involved with TPUSA, it's gonna take people that ever watched him," Freda said. "And he's not somebody that is replaceable... It's going to take a lot of people. And it's a massive effort. But I think he, through the work that he did for – what was it, 13 years when he started – he was like 18, 17. He built that foundation so that now it's there, the structure's already there for people to do that."</p></body></div></body></html>

Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show’s potential return," the company’s statement read.</p><p>Sinclair, which operates 30 ABC affiliates, previously joined Nexstar, another owner of ABC affiliates, in preempting Kimmel’s show last week after he made controversial comments regarding Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin.</p><p>"Mr. Kimmel’s remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country," Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith said in a statement.</p><p>At the time, Sinclair said that it would not lift its suspension until after discussions with ABC.</p><p>"Sinclair also calls upon Mr. Kimmel to issue a direct apology to the Kirk family.

"Regardless of ABC’s plans for the future of the program, Sinclair intends not to return ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ to our air until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform."</p><p>Kimmel's late-night show was pulled off the air entirely last Wednesday after Kimmel's remarks about the alleged assassin of Charlie Kirk sparked outrage and a veiled threat from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). </p><p>Disney decided to suspend the show after Sinclair and Nexstar pulled its airings of Kimmel, and Kimmel reportedly had told executives he would not apologize for his comments.</p><p>Disney reversed course on Monday and announced that Kimmel’s show would return in a statement Monday.</p><p>"Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country.  It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.  We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday," a Disney spokesperson told Fox News Digital.</p></body></div></body></html>

<div class="article-source">Latest &amp; Breaking News on Fox News</div>
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Brittany Aldean felt a range of emotions while attending Charlie Kirk's memorial service in Arizona on Sunday.</p><p>Brittany, 37, joined husband Jason Aldean and nearly 100,000 others at State Farm Stadium to mourn the loss of the Turning Point founder, who was shot and killed while speaking outside of Utah Valley University on Sept. 10.</p><p>The former "American Idol" star admitted the day "was overwhelming," but that she was inspired by how Kirk "impacted people" as she detailed the service for her social media followers on Instagram.</p><p>"Yesterday we went to Charlie's funeral service in Arizona, and it was vastly different than what I anticipated in the sense that it was just so faith-based," Brittany began. "I knew it was going to be but everyone was worshiping … everybody. There was just something different in the room."</p><p>President Donald Trump, Charlie's wife Erika Kirk, and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. were just a few of the speakers to eulogize Kirk Sunday.</p><p>"This man's legacy that he has left, the impact that he's had on so many people … Like, I knew he had impacted a ton of people, but this feels different," Brittany said. "His death does feel like – everyone said in the services – a revival. It's putting more people in touch with their faith, and just making such a difference in so many different lives, and it was very apparent yesterday."</p><p>She noted, "It was overwhelming. I expected to go in there and cry the whole time. I brought this big thing of tissues, and instead, it was weirdly positive and extremely sad, but it was awesome to hear stories about him personally and … how he's impacted people, and how he's going to be so missed, but that his legacy was so large."</p><p>"He had a different purpose in life, and it was just so good to hear people say that. There was just a different plan that was greater for him that God knew," she said. "It left me feeling more positive after the service, and he's obviously so missed. Something's different about this."</p><p>Brittany left her followers with the note, "They keep saying live like Charlie, so I'm going to really try to do that daily."</p><p>The Aldeans were just a few of the prominent figures who paid their respects to Kirk at his memorial service in Glendale.</p><p>During an appearance on "Fox &amp; Friends," Savannah Chrisley — who was set to join Kirk on a college campus tour before his assassination — opened up about the impact the conservative activist had on her life and explained why it is important to continue his fight. </p><p>"I think when this assassin did take Charlie's life, that was the turning point for him," Chrisley said. "He thought he was ending Charlie's life, but he really just created millions and millions of Charlie's followers to fight. To fight for our freedom, to fight for us to have a voice. For me to watch it, it's so sad and it breaks my heart. To see Erika [Charlie's wife] step in as a woman and take on this role, Charlie knew that if he couldn't do it, she was the only one that could do it."</p><p>Chrisley said that Kirk "gave [her] a voice in times when she felt she didn't have one."</p><p>"I was so excited to get to sit next to Charlie and open up to him and get to know him on a more personal level, like a lot of my friends who got to know him," she said. "But above all else, Charlie has been a voice for our country." </p><p>The reality TV star said it is remarkable to see how Charlie's legacy at Turning Point USA has impacted young adults, including her brother. </p><p>"To watch my 19-year-old brother and watch all these college kids now show up and be loud and not be afraid because, at the end of the day, our lives are on the line," she said. "2028 is coming up. And Charlie, he wants us to fight. He wants us to be loud. And he said it himself, 'If you don't correct evil, if you don't speak about evil, when evil is happening, then that in itself is evil.' So it's my job to stand up, be loud, and really I don't care who likes it and who doesn't."</p><p>"I keep saying that above all else, Charlie Kirk and his wife Erika, are Christians," she continued. "Isn't that really the message? I think bringing Christianity back into households is the only thing that's going to save us as a country. I know for me, my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, I don't know where I would be today without it. And so watching Erika, I don't know how she spoke the word of God after losing her husband. I mean, I was in such awe to know that she is now the leader of Turning Point. I mean, we only go up from here."</p><p>Authorities identified Kirk's murder suspect as Tyler Robinson, 22. Robinson was arrested and charged with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily harm, and two counts of obstruction of justice, according to a court affidavit. A judge ordered that he be held without bail.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Christina Dugan Ramirez contributed to this report.</i></p></body></div></body></html>

<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody"><p>Deion Sanders is focused on his quarterback situation with the Colorado Buffaloes, but he made a bold prediction about his son Shedeur Sanders’ NFL future with the Cleveland Browns.</p><p>"Coach Prime" said he believes his son will start for the Browns at some point this season.</p><p>Sanders shared his thoughts Monday on the "New Heights" podcast, telling hosts Jason and Travis Kelce he has "got a feeling when it’s going to go down."</p><p>When asked what advice he’s given Shedeur, who is waiting his turn behind Joe Flacco and Dillon Gabriel, Deion said: "Be patient and be ready." He declined to reveal when he expects Shedeur to make his first start, and the Kelces did not press him.</p><p>Head coach Kevin Stefanski has given no indication of a quarterback change. Flacco has led the Browns to a 1-2 record through three games, with the offense inconsistent but the defense among the league’s best.</p><p>Shedeur isn’t even the primary backup at this point. Gabriel, selected two rounds earlier in the 2025 NFL Draft, earned that role after preseason evaluations, Stefanski said.</p><p>Deion also revisited draft-night drama, confirming that Shedeur slid to the fifth round before being picked by Cleveland. He said the Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles both showed interest.</p><p>Cam Newton, the former No. 1 overall pick, recently noted the Eagles’ pursuit of Shedeur. As for the Ravens, Deion essentially confirmed reports that his son told executive vice president Ozzie Newsome he wasn’t interested in sitting behind Lamar Jackson long-term.</p><p>"How in the world can somebody fault [Shedeur] for saying or thinking, ‘Why in the world would I go back up Lamar for 10 more years?’" Deion said on the podcast. "I’ve never sat on the bench and said, ‘Well, I learned a lot today.’"</p><p>The Browns drafted Shedeur with the expectation of developing him for the future, with Flacco seen as a stopgap until one of their rookies is ready. So far, the coaching staff believes Gabriel is ahead, but the season is still young.</p><p>For now, Shedeur remains third on the depth chart, though Deion remains confident his son will eventually get his chance.

<div class="article-title">Sean "Diddy" Combs has served enough time in prison, defense tells judge</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Lawyers for music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs urged a New York federal judge Monday to sentence him early next month to no more than 14 months in prison for his conviction on two <span class="link">prostitution-related charges</span>, meaning he'd go free almost immediately if the judge agreed.</p><p>The lawyers made their arguments in a written submission to Judge Arun Subramanian, who has already rejected a proposed $50 million bail package, signaling that he doesn't believe the Grammy-winning artist is close to being released.</p><p>"Mr. Combs's celebrity status in the realms of music, fashion, spirits, media, and finance has been shattered and Mr. Combs's legacy has been destroyed," the lawyers wrote, saying their client has been punished enough.</p><p>The submission provided new information about what life behind bars for nearly 13 months has been like for Combs, what's happened to his businesses and other interests and explains why he turned down a plea-deal offer from prosecutors prior to his trial.</p><h2>Combs will learn his sentencing fate on Oct. 3</h2><p>Combs faces an <span class="link">Oct. 3 sentencing</span> after his July conviction by a Manhattan jury on two Mann Act charges that outlaw interstate commerce related to prostitution. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>The Bad Boy Records founder was exonerated on more serious racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that would have required a minimum of 15 years in prison and the possibility of a life sentence.</p><p>In their submission, Combs' lawyers argued that a jury sent a loud message to the judge by exonerating him of the most serious charges.</p><p>"Put simply, the jury has spoken. Its verdict represents an 'affirmative indication of innocence,'" the lawyers said.</p><p>"He has served over a year in one of the most notorious jails in America - yet has made the most of that punishment. It is time for Mr. Combs to go home to his family, so he can continue his treatment and try to make the most of the next chapter of his extraordinary life," they added.</p>
<p>Prosecutors, who will submit their recommendations prior to the Oct. 3 sentencing, have already said they'll urge Combs stay imprisoned substantially longer than the four to five years they originally thought.</p><p>Defense lawyers, though, wrote in their submission Monday that prosecutors "have lost all perspective."</p><h2>Combs's career and reputation are ruined, lawyers say</h2><p>"Mr. Combs's career and reputation have been destroyed," they wrote. "His life outside of jail has been systematically dismantled."</p><p>Among other things, they noted that he had to let go over 100 employees from his businesses and many of them have been unable to get new jobs because of their past association with Combs.</p><p>His seven children, they said, have faced "devastating consequences," including lost business opportunities in acting, television, fashion and concerts, with some of them being included in some of the nearly 100 civil lawsuits filed against Combs since his arrest.</p><p>The lawyers also noted that Combs and his family were set to star in a Hulu show about their lives, but the show was cancelled once the allegations against him became public.</p><p>Combs was removed from the boards at three charter schools he created in Harlem, the Bronx and Connecticut and was stripped of an honorary doctorate degree from Howard University, which plans to return his prior donations, they said.</p>
<h2>Inmate approached Combs with a shiv, lawyers say</h2><p>Meanwhile, Combs's <span class="link">life in prison</span> has been harrowing at times, even as it has allowed him to become sober for the first time in 25 years, his lawyers said.</p><p>On one occasion, another inmate approached Combs with a shiv, accusing Combs of sitting on a chair that the inmate wanted to sit on, before Combs defused the situation and calmed the man and his makeshift weapon down, the lawyers said.</p><p>They said he has been under constant suicide watch, meaning every two hours he must present his identification card to guards to show he is alive and well and is awakened from sleep in a brightly lighted cell by a guard to ensure he is well.</p><p>He also has limited access to clean water, leaving him to heat the water that he drinks to ensure it won't make him sick and he must sleep within two feet of other inmates in a dorm-style room containing a bathroom and no door, the lawyers wrote.</p><p>"Mr. Combs has not breathed fresh air in nearly 13 months, or felt sunlight on his skin, often walking with a limp due to a painful knee injury that requires surgery," they said. And the food, they added, sometimes contains maggots.</p><h2>Lawyers say Combs had no choice to face trial after plea offer</h2><p>Prior to trial, the lawyers said, prosecutors offered Combs a plea deal that would have recommended a prison sentence of at least 25 years and required him to plead guilty to crimes of which he was acquitted.</p><p>They portrayed their client as a changed man, who had realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in.</p>
<p>"Without minimizing Mr. Combs's conduct, this is in many ways a 'sex, drugs, and rock n' roll' story," they said. "Mr. Combs had severe substance abuse problems throughout the entirety of the offense conduct and participated in a high-octane celebrity lifestyle."</p><p>The music maven's trial featured lengthy testimony from two former girlfriends of Combs who said they felt forced to participate in drug-fueled sex marathons with male sex workers as Combs watched and sometimes filmed the dayslong encounters.</p><p>R&amp;B singer Cassandra "Cassie" Ventura testified that she participated in hundreds of the meetups that were referred to as "freak-offs" while she was his most frequent girlfriend from 2007 to 2018.</p><p>Another ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym "Jane," said she also felt pressured to perform sexually with male sex workers while she dated Combs from 2021 until his arrest at a New York hotel a year ago.</p><h2>Lawyers say a sober Combs looks to new future unlike his past</h2><p>There was also extensive testimony during the trial about Combs beating his girlfriends and using violence and the fears of it to control those around him.</p><p>Defense lawyers at trial conceded there was domestic abuse but said the charges brought by prosecutors were not proven.</p><p>While he was once so depressed in jail that "there were days when he was unable to get out of his bed or even talk to the psychology department," his lawyers said he looks forward to the future.</p>
<p>They said he has begun teaching other inmates essential skills in business management, entrepreneurship and personal development.</p><p>The lawyers wrote that the education program has become "one of the most impactful and important endeavors of his life" and he hopes to expand it to state-run facilities once he is released.</p><p>"He is a humbled man who understands that the most important things in life are his devotion to and quality time with his family and his contributions for the benefit of others," they said.</p><h2>Possibility of a pardon</h2><p>Combs' lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, <span class="link">told CBS News in July</span> that he has not had any conversations with the Trump administration about seeking a pardon for his client after another attorney for Combs, Nicole Westmoreland, told CNN it was her understanding that the defense team "had conversations in reference to a pardon." </p><p>But Agnifilo told CBS News, "I have nothing to do with a possible pardon."</p><p>"I have had conversations with nobody," Agnifilo said. "I have not spoken to the president. I have not spoken to anybody who speaks to the president about Sean Combs. I have not."</p><p>He says he hasn't discussed it with Combs either, except to tell him what's in the news.</p>
<p>"He says, 'Go tell him (Mr. Trump) that I need a pardon,'" Agnofilo said. "'Go tell him I deserve a pardon.' That's what he said."</p>

<div class="article-title">Quest for Queen Cleopatra's lost tomb reveals a sunken ancient harbor</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Cairo —</em> Archaeologists say they have discovered evidence of an ancient, long-submerged Mediterranean port that was linked to the <span class="link">Taposiris Magna Temple</span> near Egypt's northern coastal city of Alexandria. The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced the discovery last week, expanding on what's known about the temple complex about 30 miles west of Alexandria that dates to the Ptolemaic period, more than 2,000 years ago.</p><p>The Egyptian-Dominican archaeological mission, led by Dr. Kathleen Martinez from the Universidad Nacional Pedro Henriquez Ureña, along with Dr. Robert Ballard, who located the Titanic shipwreck in 1985, has been conducting geological and archaeological surveys of the coastal area surrounding the temple.</p><p>Working in collaboration with Dr. Larry Mayer, from the University of New Hampshire, and the Egyptian Navy Hydrographic Department (ENHD) and the Egyptian Department of Underwater Antiquities, it was this team that uncovered the evidence of an ancient submerged port.</p>
<p>Martinez told CBS News that after mapping the seabed with state-of-the-art sonar technologies, and then using software to simulate pre-submersion conditions, the team revealed a submerged ancient shoreline about 2.5 miles from the present coast, including a site with an old inner harbor that would have been protected by coral reefs.</p><p>Their research also revealed an extension of a tunnel linking the temple, the remains of which are about half of a mile from the current coastline, to the old port. The tunnel extended to an area known as "Salam 5," where divers found basalt base fragments similar to those from statues inside the sanctuary.</p><p>The team also found several stone and metal anchors of various shapes and sizes scattered near the reef, along with numerous broken amphorae that were recovered from inside the sunken harbor, all dating to the Ptolemaic period.</p>
<p>Martinez told CBS News that, along with the discovery of seven shafts connected to an underground passage near the sanctuary of Taposiris Magna, linked with other subsurface structures and some contemporary buildings in front of the sanctuary, the findings "strongly indicate that Taposiris Magna functioned as an active maritime zone with at least an inner harbor in antiquity."</p><p>"The development of peripheral harbors, towards the decongestion of the central one in Alexandria, would be a matter of necessity. Taposiris Magna would be part of the network of peripheral harbor towns, providing access to Egypt from the west, and assisting in the distribution of Egyptian products across the Mediterranean," she said.</p>
<p>As no ancient texts refer to a harbor at Taposiris Magna, the results of the research represent a significant contribution of new knowledge, throwing open an entirely new chapter in the history of the site, Martinez said.</p><h2>The quest for Cleopatra's tomb</h2><p>But while discovering the port is important, she's looking for something else. Like many other archaeologists, Martinez wants to find the tomb of Egypt's last queen, <span class="link">Cleopatra VII</span>, who ruled from about 51 B.C. - 30 B.C. </p>
<p>While many of her contemporaries in the field have long focused their hunt for Cleopatra's tomb among the ruins of <span class="link">Alexandria's Royal Quarters</span>, Martinez has trained her sights for the last 20 years on Taposiris Magna.</p><p>"I dedicated 10 years previous to that to studying Cleopatra's life and death," said Martinez.</p><p>The ancient queen allied herself with Roman general Mark Antony after Julius Caesar's death, to jointly face Caesar's heir Octavian (or Octavius). </p><p>When they were defeated at the Battle of Actium, they fled to Egypt. Octavius pursued them, and in 30 B.C. they both committed suicide separately, but they are believed by many historians to have been buried together in Alexandria.</p><p>Martinez, however, believes the tomb is actually in Taposiris Magna, about 30 miles further southwest down Egypt's Mediterranean coast. She considers it "the perfect final resting place for Queen Cleopatra." </p><p>When she started the project, Martinez presented her hypothesis to Egyptian officials. </p><p>"Of course, they didn't believe me," she told CBS News. </p>
<p>She said she predicted they would find a necropolis at the site, likely from the time of Cleopatra. </p><p>"We did," she told CBS News. "We have already discovered and excavated 21 catacombs. We have a projection that at least we have 20 or 25 more…  We have more than 600 human remains and more than 30 mummies… And we will discover the tomb [of Cleopatra]."</p>
<p>There are archeologists who disagree with Martinez and stand by the theory that Cleopatra's tomb is in the Royal Quarters, in the center of ancient Alexandria. But she's unmoved.</p><p>"It's not there, because the Romans hated Queen Cleopatra. And they wanted desperately to take her to Rome and parade her," Martinez told CBS News. "Octavius would have done anything to bring Cleopatra to Rome and parade her in chains, and maybe give her the most horrible death that the Romans could inflict."  </p><p>"But Cleopatra didn't want to go to Rome, and she tried to find a way to escape from that destiny and she wanted to stay in Egypt."</p><p>Martinez said the new Roman emperor could have taken her alive, or brought her remains to Rome, so she needed to secure a location where her remains could not be easily discovered, which she believes would have made the Royal Quarters a very unlikely choice.</p><p>Taposiris Magna was built as a temple dedicated to the goddess Isis, and Cleopatra, Martinez said, "presented herself always, as the new Isis."</p>
<p>She explained that the location had a strong religious context, and crucially, it was not under the control of the Romans at the time, unlike the Royal Quarters.</p><p>"She outsmarted the Romans," said Martinez.</p><p>Martinez told CBS News that the team will continue their exploration of the harbor site in about a week, and it is set to go on for at least another two months.</p>
<p>"This is the first time that we're going to actually excavate underwater. It is going to be very exciting," she said, adding that nobody is known to have ever dived at the site before. "We don't know what we're going to discover there because this is the beginning of the search."</p><p>"It's a mystery. There was very little information about this place," she said. "The site itself sometimes leads you in a certain direction." </p><p>For two millennia, Cleopatra has been successful in hiding the location of her remains, not just from the Romans, but from archaeologists.</p><p>Martinez has no hangups about dedicating herself to the quest for Cleopatra for nearly three decades.</p>
<p>"Well, it's a 2,000-year-old puzzle, and you are putting the pieces together,"  she told CBS News, adding that she remains "100% convinced that it's a matter of time" before her work finally pays off.</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Gabrielle strengthened into a major hurricane on Monday, days after forming in the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season.</p><p>The Miami-based National Hurricane Center said Gabrielle was likely to head further out into the Atlantic, posing no threat to land. No watches or warnings have been issued, but the NHC said the powerful hurricane would continue to generate swells that would affect the coasts of Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast, from North Carolina northward to Canada for a few days.</p><p>"These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions," the center said.    </p><h2>Hurricane Gabrielle forecast and path</h2><p>By Tuesday morning, Gabrielle was more than 300 miles east of Bermuda, tracking northeast at about 13 mph, the hurricane center said.

<p>Tropical-storm-force winds extended outward some 140 miles from Gabrielle's center, the hurricane center said. The storm is forecast to turn more to the northeast on Tuesday, the center said.</p>
<p>Gabrielle took shape about one week after what was historically considered the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs annually from June 1 to Nov. 30 and has in the past become most active around Sept. 10. </p><p>Officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration initially predicted the 2025 season would be busier than usual and produce more named storms than an average year.

<div class="article-title">Copenhagen Airport shut down for hours by large, unidentified drones</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>Copenhagen, Denmark</em> — Flights at Copenhagen Airport resumed early Tuesday after being suspended or diverted overnight because of drone sightings. Police reported two to three large, unidentified drones were seen Monday night, forcing outgoing flights at Scandinavia's largest airport to be grounded and others diverted to airports nearby.</p><p> "Copenhagen Airport has reopened after being closed due to drone activity. However, there will be delays and some canceled departures. Passengers are advised to check with their airline for further information," the airport's website said.</p><p> Local media showed a significant police presence in the vicinity of the airport.</p><p> A drone incident the same evening at the Oslo, Norway, airport forced all traffic to move to one runway, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK. Traffic later returned to normal and it's unclear who was responsible.</p><p>The unknown perpetrator in Copenhagen was a capable drone pilot with the ability to fly them many miles to reach the airport, Jens Jespersen of the Copenhagen Police said during a news conference Tuesday morning. The pilot seemed to be showing off their skills, he said.</p>
<p>"The number, size, flight patterns, time over the airport. All this  together... indicates that it is a capable actor. Which capable actor, I  do not know," Jespersen said.</p>
<p>Police chose not to shoot down the drones due to the risk posed by their location near the airport full of passengers, planes on runways and nearby fuel depots, he said.</p><p>Investigators are looking at how the drones reached the airport — whether it was by land or possibly on boats coming through the strategic straights into the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>Jespersen said authorities could not rule out the possibility of the drones being part of a Russian hybrid attack.</p><h2>Russian drone and warplane incursions into Europe raise concern</h2><p>Security concerns in northern Europe have been heightened following an increase in Russian <span class="link">sabotage activities</span> and multiple drone and fighter jet incursions into NATO airspace in recent weeks, which have seen some of America's European NATO allies accuse Moscow of serious provocations amid the ongoing <span class="link">Russian invasion of Ukraine</span>. </p>
<p>Russian drones were <span class="link">shot down by Polish and allied NATO warplanes</span> after crossing into Polish airspace on Sept. 9. Ten days later, Estonia said several Russian fighter jets entered its airspace.</p><p>Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said on social media that Russia was testing NATO's political and military response and aiming to reduce Western support for Ukraine by compelling countries to redirect resources toward the defense of alliance countries.</p><p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday denied that Russian planes entered Estonia's airspace, saying they remained in international airspace and accusing European nations of "escalating tensions and provoking a confrontational atmosphere."</p><p>Jonatan Vseviov, who heads the Estonian foreign ministry, told the country's ERR public broadcaster, however, that the government had "irrefutable evidence" of the Russian incursion, adding: "The fact that Russia is provocatively and dangerously violating the airspace of a NATO country is one thing. The fact that it is openly lying to the whole world about it is another."</p>

<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A man arrested in connection with a shooting at a television station building in Sacramento faces federal charges and made a federal court appearance on Monday after he was arrested by the FBI over the weekend.</p><p>Sacramento police say officers responded to the 400 block of Broadway, the ABC10 building, just after 1:30 p.m. local time on Friday to investigate reports of shots fired. At the scene, police say officers found that the building had been struck by gunfire. Police say at least three rounds struck the building, apparently hitting a window. No injuries were reported. </p><p>Police classified the incident as a drive-by shooting, saying it appeared a vehicle drove by the building, fired, then drove away. </p><p>Anibal Hernandez-Santana, 64, was arrested by the Sacramento Police Department on three charges related to a drive-by shooting at the ABC10 building in Sacramento on Friday. </p><p>He was arrested on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, shooting into an occupied building, and negligent discharge of a firearm, according to the Sacramento Police Department. By Saturday afternoon, Hernandez-Santana was released on bail, listed at $200,000. </p>
<p>Hernandez-Santana was arrested later the same day by the FBI, a spokesperson confirms to CBS Sacramento, on probable cause of willfully or maliciously interfering with or causing interference to a radio communications station.</p><p>Monday, FBI Director Kash Patel commented on the arrest in a post on X. </p><p>"Targeted acts of violence are unacceptable and will be pursued to the fullest extent of the law," Patel wrote. </p><p>The <span class="link">defense attorney for Hernandez-Santana</span> said Sunday that he was caught off guard by the FBI's involvement in the case. </p>
<p>Hernandez-Santana made his initial appearance in federal court in Sacramento on Monday, and now also faces charges of possession and discharge of a firearm within a school zone. </p><p>The motive for the shooting remains under investigation, the department said. But <span class="link">the federal complaint released on Monday</span> revealed some details. Prosecutors stated there was a handwritten note, which references FBI Director Kash Patel, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi, as well as Jeffrey Epstein, and reads: "For hiding Epstein &amp; ignoring red flags. Do not support Patel, Bongino, &amp; AG Pam Bondie [sic]. They're next. – C.K. from above."</p><p>He will make his first appearance on the local charges in Sacramento on Tuesday.   </p>
<p>KXTV Channel 10 is an ABC affiliate station owned by Tegna. ABC sparked controversy this week when it <span class="link">suspended "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"</span> after the host's comments about the <span class="link">death of Charlie Kirk</span>. </p><p>"We haven't had a lot of attacks on our media partners, and we'd like to keep it that way," said Anthony Gamble, a public information officer for the Sacramento Police Department. "This is unacceptable behavior. And so you know, to those that may have been responsible for this, and I hope you see this, we're not going to stop looking for you. This is unacceptable behavior. It's not going to be tolerated in Sacramento."</p><p>"While details are still limited, importantly all of our employees are safe and unharmed," said Molly McMahon, a spokesperson for Tegna. "We are fully cooperating with law enforcement and have taken additional measures to ensure the continued safety of our employees."</p><p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office issued a statement on X after the governor was briefed on the shooting. </p>
<p>"While no injuries have been reported, any act of violence toward journalists is an attack on our democracy itself and must be condemned in the strongest terms," Newsom's office said. "We stand with reporters and staff who work every day to keep communities informed and safe!"</p><p>In a statement Monday, Sacramento County District Attorney Thien Ho announced his office would be filing felony charges of discharging a firearm into an inhabited dwelling and assault with a semi-automatic firearm -- along with a personal use of a firearm allegation -- against Hernandez-Santana. </p>

<div class="article-title">Man charged with shining laser pointer at Marine One with Trump aboard</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>A man accused of shining a laser pointer at presidential helicopter Marine One with President Trump aboard was arrested on federal charges Monday.</p><p>Jacob Samuel Winkler, 33, of Washington, D.C., is charged with aiming the beam of a laser pointer at an aircraft, a felony punishable by a maximum prison sentence of five years. Online court records don't list an attorney representing him.</p><p>Marine One was airborne on Saturday after departing the White House when a U.S. Secret Service patrol officer spotted Winkler walking on a sidewalk, shirtless and loudly talking to himself, the officer wrote in an affidavit. The officer said he shone a flashlight at Winkler, who allegedly retaliated by flashing a red laser beam at the officer's face.</p><p>As Marine One flew over their heads, Winkler looked up and shined the laser pointer at the helicopter, according to the officer. </p><p>"This placed Marine One at risk of an airborne collision," the Secret Service officer wrote.</p>
<p>After the officer handcuffed him, Winkler repeatedly said phrases like "I should apologize to Donald Trump," the affidavit alleges.</p><p>Winkler allegedly told investigators that he points the laser "at all kinds of things, such as stop signs," and didn't know he couldn't point it at Marine One, the affidavit says. Investigators also found a small knife in his possession, according to the officer.</p><p>"This behavior endangers Marine One and everyone on board," U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, the top prosecutor in D.C., said in a statement to The Associated Press. "If you engage in this act, you will be identified and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."</p><p>The court filing doesn't say if anybody aboard the helicopter noticed the laser. But the officer said Winkler's conduct could have temporarily blinded or disoriented a pilot, placing Marine One at risk of an airborne collision with other helicopters in the area.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration says lasers pose a "serious safety threat" to aircraft because they can incapacitate pilots. The agency has recorded 5,913 laser incidents so far this year — or about 28 per day — and 12,840 last year.</p>

<div class="article-title">Meet the 2025 Fat Bear Week contenders</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The bracket for Fat Bear Week 2025 has been revealed, and 12 bears at Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska are looking for votes from all over the world — but only one will be crowned the champion of the fat bears. </p><p>For more than a decade, the Fat Bear Week contest has been highlighting some of the largest brown bears on the planet living along Brooks River inside the national park as they prepare for hibernation. The annual vote for fattest bear of the year begins Tuesday, Sept. 23, and will continue through Sept. 30. People can vote online between 12 and 9 p.m. ET each day.</p><p>Bear lovers can also watch the fattened animals in their natural habitats in a series of livestreams on Explore.org, a multimedia organization that partners with the National Park Service to host the bear competition.</p>
<h2>What is Fat Bear Week?</h2><p>Fat Bear Week began in 2014 as a one-day event, Sarah Bruce, a park ranger at <span class="link">Katmai National Park and Preserve</span>, told CBS News.</p><p>"It's a really great way to kind of showcase these bears that we have in southwest Alaska," Bruce said. "It's very difficult to get to, so the cameras and Fat Bear Week make this park more accessible for folks who are unable to visit."</p><p>It was started by Explore.org resident naturalist and former park ranger Mike Fitz, who saw the size difference in the park's bears from late June to July — when they are most active along the river — compared to later in September.</p>
<h2>How fat do the bears get?</h2><p>Scientists have estimated that the bears can pack on as much as 700 pounds as they get ready to hibernate for the winter, Bruce said. That means the bears can end up weighing more than 1,400 pounds.</p><p>"They get super fat, and it's really important to get fat. A fat bear is a healthy bear," she explained. "So they're eating about a year's worth of food within the span of five to six months. When they go into hibernation, they're not eating anymore, so they survive on their fat stores."</p><p>And what does the winner of Fat Bear Week get?</p><p>"Their prize is winning and surviving another winter season, which is the most difficult season for these bears," Bruce said.</p>
<h2>Meet the 2025 Fat Bear Week contenders</h2><p>Fat Bear Week contenders were announced during a livestream on Monday without issue, after last year's bracket reveal was <span class="link">postponed following a skirmish</span> between two Alaskan grizzlies that led to the death of one of the animals.</p>
<p>While around 80 bears frequent the Brooks River during their active season, 12 bears are chosen for Fat Bear Week because of certain criteria, including whether there are before and after photographs of the bears, park ranger and photographer Ashleigh Monaco said Monday.</p><p>Fitz said the competition is subjective and voters can place their vote for their favorite bear.</p><p>These are the bears vying to be this year's champion:</p><h3>128 Jr.</h3>
<p>Fat Bear Jr. winner 128 Jr., or "Biggie," is the offspring of 128. The dark fur bear is about 1 1/2 years old. She had a sibling who was unable to survive last summer, according to Monaco.</p><p>"While it is tragic that that cub didn't survive, it just goes to show 128's strength and resiliency in overcoming the challenges of living on the Brooks River herself," Monaco said.</p><h3>609</h3>
<p>Going against 128 Jr. in the bracket's first quadrant is 5-year-old 609, the daughter of 909 and the champion of Fat Bear Jr. 2022. She has noticeably large round ears and a long nose.</p><h3>602</h3>
<p>Either 128 Jr. or 609 will face off against 602, a newbie to the competition. </p>
<p>He loves lounging and taking long naps by the river, Monaco said, and he dominated the category of size and strength this summer. Nicknamed "Flow-tato," 602 is often spotted doing "a little stomping dance," possibly a response to high adrenaline or excitement.</p><h3>503</h3>
<p>In the bracket's second quadrant is 503. The 12-year-old is resourceful, playful and tolerant, allowing the younger bears to sometimes take his leftovers.</p><h3>901</h3>
<p>This 7-year-old bear has "never been fatter," said Naomi Boak, a media ranger at Katmai. In 2023, 901 had three cubs, but none of them survived. </p><p>"But she's back, and she's big," Boak said, adding that cubs could be in her future next season.</p><h3>32 Chunk</h3>
<p>Either 503 or 901 will have to face 32 Chunk, the runner-up of last year's Fat Bear Week. He was among the most dominant bears last year, but this year he is healing from a broken jaw, possibly from an altercation with another male over a female, according to Boak. </p><p>"That's a typical injury, and it's not an easy injury to live with, but he has powered through his injury," Boak said. "He is fishing and he is getting fatter than ever."</p><h3>26</h3>
<p>In the third quadrant is 26, a mother bear with twins "with plenty of energy and spunk," said photographer Christine Loberg.</p>
<h3>909</h3>
<p>This is the daughter of the 2018 Fat Bear Week champion, 409 Beadnose. 909 loves catching fish by the waterfall, simply catching them with her mouth.</p><h3>128</h3>
<p>The mother of this year's Fat Bear Jr. champion is approximately 20 years old. Also known as Grazer, she stands out with her blond fur.</p><h3>99</h3>
<p>Bear 99 is identifiable by his chocolate milk-color coat, according to Bruce. While he's still quite young, he has got enough fish this year to land him in the fat bear bracket.</p><h3>856</h3>
<p>The next bear in the fourth quadrant is 856, who Bruce called "the old man of the river." He's one of the oldest bears on the Brooks River.</p><h3>910</h3>
<p>The last 2025 Fat Bear Week contender is 910. She's described as a rectangle and a cruise ship because of how large she is.</p>

<div class="article-title">NASA introduces 10 new astronaut candidates</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>NASA on Monday introduced 10 new astronauts, four men and six women selected from more than 8,000 applicants, to begin training for future flights to the International Space Station, the moon and, eventually, <span class="link">Mars</span>. </p><p>"One of these 10 could actually be one of the first Americans to put their boots on the Mars surface, which is very, very cool," Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, also NASA's acting administrator, said in welcoming remarks.</p><p>"No pressure, NASA, we have some work to do," he said.</p>
<h2>Meet the astronauts</h2><p>This is NASA's first astronaut class with more women than men. It includes six pilots with experience in high-performance aircraft, a biomedical engineer, an anesthesiologist, a geologist and a former SpaceX launch director.</p><p>Among the new astronaut candidates is 39-year-old Anna Menon, a mother of two who flew to orbit in 2024 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon as a private astronaut on a commercial, non-NASA flight.</p><p>"I am so thrilled to be back here with the NASA family," Menon said. "As more and more people venture into space ... we have this awesome opportunity to learn a tremendous amount to help support those astronauts ... and help keep them healthy and safe. So it's an exciting time to be here."</p>
<p>Menon worked for NASA for seven years as a biomedical researcher and flight controller before joining SpaceX in 2018. She served as a senior engineer and was later selected as the onboard medical officer during the commercial <span class="link">Polaris Dawn</span> mission, chartered by billionaire Jared Isaacman.</p>
<p>She married her husband, Anil, in 2016 while both were working for NASA. A former Air Force flight surgeon, Anil Menon joined SpaceX as its first medical officer in 2018. He joined NASA's astronaut corps in 2021 and is now assigned to a long-duration space station crew scheduled for launch aboard a Russian Soyuz next summer.</p><p>Anna and Anil Menon are among several couples who served in the astronaut corps at the same time. But only one couple ever flew in orbit together — shuttle astronauts Mark Lee and Jan Davis in 1992.</p><p>The other members of the 2025 astronaut class are:</p><ul><li>Army Chief Warrant Officer 3 Ben Bailey, 38, a graduate of the Naval Test Pilot School with more than 2,000 hours flying more than 30 different aircraft, including recent work with UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47F Chinook helicopters.</li><li>Lauren Edgar, 40, who holds a Ph.D. in geology from the California Institute of Technology, with experience supporting NASA's Mars exploration rovers and, more recently, serving as a deputy principal investigator with NASA's Artemis 3 moon landing mission.</li><li>Air Force Maj. Adam Fuhrmann, 35, an Air Force Test Pilot School graduate with more than 2,100 hours flying F-16 and F-35 jets. He holds a master's degree in flight test engineering.</li><li>Air Force Maj. Cameron Jones, 35, another graduate of Air Force Test Pilot School as well as the Air Force Weapons School with more than 1,600 hours flying high-performance aircraft, spending most of his time flying the F-22 Raptor.</li><li>Yuri Kubo, 40, a former SpaceX launch director with a master's in electrical and computer engineering who also competed in ultimate frisbee contests.</li><li>Rebecca Lawler, 38, a former Navy P-3 Orion pilot and experimental test pilot with more than 2,800 hours of flight time, including stints flying a NOAA hurricane hunter aircraft. She was a Naval Academy graduate and was a test pilot for United Airlines at the time of her selection.</li><li>Imelda Muller, 34, a former undersea medical officer for the Navy with a medical degree from the University of Vermont's Robert Larner College of Medicine; she was completing her residency in anesthesia at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore at the time of her astronaut selection.</li><li>Navy Lt. Cmdr. Erin Overcash, 34, a Naval Test Pilot School graduate and an experienced F/A-18 and F/A-18F Super Hornet pilot with 249 aircraft carrier landings. She also trained with the USA Rugby Women's National Team.</li><li>Katherine Spies, 43, a former Marine Corps AH-1 attack helicopter pilot and a graduate of the Naval Test Pilot School with more than 2,000 hours flying time. She was director of flight test engineering for Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. at the time of her astronaut selection.</li></ul><p>The new astronaut candidates will spend two years training at the Johnson Space Center and around the world with partner space agencies before becoming eligible for flight assignments.</p>
<h2>Astronauts join space race in uncertain times</h2><p>The new astronauts are joining <span class="link">NASA</span>'s ranks at a time of great uncertainty given the Trump administration's budget cuts, <span class="link">plans to retire the ISS</span> at the end of the decade and challenges faced by the agency's <span class="link">Artemis moon program</span>.</p>
<p>Under the Trump administration's planned budget cuts, future NASA crew rotation flights have been extended from six months to eight, reducing the total number of flights through the end of the program. In addition, crew sizes are expected to be reduced.</p><p>It's not clear how many of the new astronauts might be able to fly to the ISS before it's retired or how many might eventually walk on the moon. Whether NASA can get there before the Chinese, who are targeting the end of the decade for <span class="link">their own moon landing mission</span>, is also uncertain.</p>
<p>But Duffy assured the new astronaut candidates that NASA will, in fact, beat China back to the moon.</p><p>"Some are challenging our leadership in space, say, like the Chinese," he said. "And I'll just tell you this: I'll be damned if the Chinese beat NASA or beat America back to the moon. We are going to win ... the second space race back to the moon, with all of you participating in that great effort."</p><p>As for flights to Mars, which the Trump administration supports, flights are not yet on the drawing board, and most experts say no such NASA mission is likely to launch within the next decade and probably longer.</p>

<div class="article-title">Trump executive order labels antifa a "domestic terrorist organization"</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump signed an executive order Monday labeling antifa a "domestic terrorist organization" — though the move's legal impact is unclear.</p><p>The executive order directs Trump administration officials to investigate and thwart "any and all illegal operations" allegedly carried out by antifa members, and to pursue people who "fund such operations" or provide material support to them.</p><p>The president <span class="link">promised to designate antifa</span> as a "major terrorist organization" last week in the wake of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, although officials have not said there was a link between his killing and any left-wing groups. </p><p>It's not clear what happens next. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, typically refers to a loose affiliation of mostly left-wing activists, and isn't generally considered to be an organized group with a clear leadership structure. And the U.S. doesn't have a statute that gives the president the power to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations or charge people with domestic terrorism, legal experts <span class="link">told CBS News</span> last week.</p><p>In a fact sheet, the White House argued antifa "has a long history of terrorizing our communities." It listed out several attacks on or threats against law enforcement agencies and pro-Trump events in recent years, some of which were allegedly carried out by people who self-identified with antifa. </p>
<p>The White House also cited Kirk's assassination as an example of a "trend of Radical Left violence." Authorities say Kirk's suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, had become "more political" in recent years and lashed out against Kirk's "hatred" in text messages, though they have not released evidence tying Robinson to antifa.</p><p>In 2020, the Congressional Research Service called antifa a "decentralized" movement made up of "independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals" who typically believe in socialism, communism and anarchism. It said followers of antifa lack a singular organizational structure, set of ideological views or common list of enemies.</p><p>University of Pittsburgh professor Michael Kenney told CBS News last week there is "no single organization called antifa," adding: "There's tremendous variation inside that movement, even on issues like political violence."</p><p>The antifa movement's roots date back to opponents of neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan in the 1980s, and an Oregon-based group became the first organization to use the term "antifa" in its name in 2007, according to the Congressional Research Service. The group gained more attention a decade later, during the clashes between far-right groups and their opponents in Charlottesville, Virginia, early in Mr. Trump's first term.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump and his appointees first vowed to crack down on antifa in his first term, with the president calling for antifa to be designated a terrorist group in 2020. He did not follow through on that threat.</p><p>In 2017, then-FBI Director Chris Wray told Congress the agency was carrying out "anarchist extremist investigations" against suspects "who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology," CRS notes. Three years later, Wray described antifa as a "movement or an ideology," not a singular group.</p><p>Mr. Trump's latest push could face legal hurdles. Unlike with foreign terrorist organizations, there isn't a legal mechanism for the president to designate a domestic terrorist group, Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, told CBS News last week. But the administration could choose to make antifa-related incidents a higher priority for federal law enforcement, he noted.</p><p>Domestic terrorism also is not a chargeable offense under federal law, though most states have a domestic terrorism statute, and other federal criminal statutes could be applied to alleged domestic terrorists.</p><p>"You can't prosecute an ideology," Baumgartner said.</p>

<div class="article-title">White House slashes medical research on monkeys, sparking fierce debate</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p><em>This story is a CBS News collaboration with the Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina.</em></p><p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million of federal grants for animal testing as major federal health agencies are phasing out research on live animals in favor of new alternatives, a joint investigation by CBS News and The Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, has found.</p><p>"We're witnessing a watershed moment right now," said Justin Goodman, the senior vice president of White Coat Waste, an animal rights nonprofit. "We have an administration that's skeptical of spending, skeptical of establishment science. … We are trying to slash and burn as much animal testing funding as possible." </p><p>The pressure for change comes from an unlikely coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan members of Congress who want to halt what animal rights groups estimate as $20 billion a year in federal spending for animal experiments. Long considered a cause of the left, the animal rights movement has expanded and gained steam under the Trump administration. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is leading the charge against high drug costs, vaccine safety and the grinding approval process required to bring innovations to market.</p>
<p>Animal tests, often involving painful experiments that end in euthanasia, have played a crucial role in developing novel vaccines for <span class="link">COVID-19</span>, malaria, polio and popular medications such as Tylenol and <span class="link">Ozempic</span>, which ushered in a craze for <span class="link">weight-loss drugs</span>.</p>
<p>"In conventional medicine, those procedures, those diagnostics, those therapeutics, for the most part, were discovered in animals," said Steven Marks, the dean of the veterinary school at Clemson University. "But they're changing the landscape of human health right now." </p><p>No one knows where it will end.</p><p>Since President Trump <span class="link">took office</span>, all major federal health agencies have promised to phase out animal research, with varying degrees of effectiveness. The Veterans Administration says it is on track, as promised, to end all primate research that's been used to develop new treatments for neurological disorders, alcoholism and mental problems.</p><p>The sprawling National Institutes of Health has agreed to phase out experiments with dogs, cats and primates, but watchdogs have found recent examples of the agency launching new animal research. Federal money has continued to flow to incomplete research projects and to contractors who breed and care for thousands of animals bound for laboratories.</p>
<p>The effort has sparked uncertainty in South Carolina, where a research company maintains a free-ranging monkey colony on secluded Morgan Island, where nearly 4,000 federally owned rhesus monkeys bask in the sun until they are shipped off to federal laboratories. </p><p>U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, a Charleston Republican, has been a leader in the animal rights fight, joined by White Coat Waste, a group that counts billionaire <span class="link">Elon Musk</span> among its supporters. Mace has introduced legislation to end federally funded animal research. She also recently inserted language in a House spending bill to force the NIH to justify continued spending on Morgan Island, which is more popularly known as "Monkey Island." </p><p>"Honestly, it's heartbreaking," Goodman told CBS News and The Post and Courier on a recent visit to waters surrounding the island.</p><p>As Goodman watched, rhesus mothers and babies romped on the island's sandy beach and stared down from palmetto trees. But each year, hundreds are "taken from this wild habitat with their friends, with their families and shipped to laboratories. They're gonna be socially isolated in tiny cages by themselves and subjected to some of the most barbaric painful experiments you can imagine," he said.</p><p>His group's mission, Goodman said, is to "slash as much animal funding as possible."</p><p>Patients who stand to benefit from continued animal research hang in the balance. Animal experiments have helped develop breakthrough drugs, like the immunotherapy that's saving the life of 11-month-old Max Harbin of Folly Beach, South Carolina. Max has a spinal condition that once ranked as the leading genetic cause of infant deaths.</p><p>Before Max's therapy was approved for pediatric use in 2019, it went through years of studies with mice and monkeys. A Food and Drug Administration official described the therapy as a way to "change the lives of those patients who may have faced a terminal condition."</p>
<p>Max's mother Laura, an animal lover, said she was unaware of the rigorous animal experiments that led to human approval for Zolgensma, a single-dose therapy made by Novartis.</p><p>"It's odd to think that it's a step in the process, but it's a necessary one, and without it, my son would be in a very, very different place. I'm definitely grateful there's a way to test it so we know it's safe."</p><p>Now, the FDA is now among the agencies promising to make a "paradigm shift" in how new drugs are approved.</p><p>It wants to use new techniques like AI-based computational modeling, lab testing on human organs and data analysis to "get safer treatments to patients faster and more reliably while also reducing R&amp;D costs and drug prices," said FDA commissioner Martin Makary. "It is a win-win for public health and ethics."</p><p>There's still a major hurdle with phasing out all federal animal research. The science behind alternatives is rapidly evolving, but many experts say it's not yet ready to serve as the only gauge of safety and effectiveness in humans.</p><p>"I want to see us get out of the business of using animals in research," said Paul Locke, who is an environmental health lawyer at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and serves on the board of the school's Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing. "The question is when. When can we do that and reach the double goal of having better science and virtually no animals? The answer is not tomorrow."</p>
<p>Locke testified this year at a congressional hearing organized by Mace about the need for federal agencies to step up in support of alternative research and "set the global standards in these fields."</p>
<p>The hearing won more attention, including supportive social media posts from President Trump, about Mace's charge that the federal government spent more than $10 million to create transgender mice and other animals and study their behaviors.</p><p>Parents like Justin and Rosalyn Porcano in San Rafael, California, are watching the debate with concern. Their 7-year-old daughter Lia has a rare genetic disorder, Usher Syndrome 1B. She was born deaf and is facing blindness, with no treatments currently available. Without medical advancements in treatment of the disorder, she will likely go blind by the time she's in high school. </p>
<p>The Porcanos found a primate researcher at the Oregon National Primate Research Center who, with the family's help, is developing a model that will allow for development of an effective treatment. The lab work is ongoing as the debate in Washington intensifies.</p><p>The couple, who run a nonprofit called Save Sight Now that is dedicated to finding treatments for Usher Syndrome 1B, said they would prefer an alternative to animal testing, but it makes no sense to them to pause research until a better solution comes along. Lia doesn't have that luxury of time, Rosalyn Porcano said.</p><p>"Until technology and science has a better solution for testing, I think that's idiotic," said Justin Porcano. "You can't just stop testing in all animal models right now. It's a crazy concept."</p><p><em>Post and Courier Reporter Mitchell Black contributed to this report.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">As Trump makes autism announcement, Tylenol maker and medical experts push back</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>President Trump announced the Food and Drug Administration believes the use of acetaminophen — the active ingredient in Tylenol and many cold and flu medications — during pregnancy can be associated with an increased risk of autism, though medical experts have said the medication is safe.  </p><p>"Effective immediately, the FDA will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism," the president said. "So, taking Tylenol is not good, alright? I'll say it. It's not good. For this reason, they are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary."  </p><p>"Ideally, a woman won't take Tylenol," he said, and pivoted to discussion of childhood vaccination, saying vaccines should be given in "smaller doses" and spread out "over a period of years," without citing medical evidence for his claims about vaccines. On his various vaccine recommendations, the president said, "You know, I'm just making these statements from me, I'm not making them from these doctors."</p><p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the FDA based its decision on acetaminophen on "clinical and laboratory studies" that "suggest a potential association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes," including one study in the public health journal Environmental Health, but added that "NIH [National Institutes of Health] research teams are currently testing multiple hypotheses."</p><p>However, in a major study published last year, researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found that acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.</p>
<p>After Mr. Trump's announcement, the FDA shared an open letter encouraging physicians to "consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy for routine low-grade fevers" — though the agency was more cautious than some of the president's statements.</p><p>"To be clear, while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature," the letter states, calling the issue an "ongoing area of scientific debate."</p><p>The letter also stated physicians should balance the possible risks of acetaminophen with the fact that it is still safer than other over-the-counter painkillers and fever-reducing drugs during pregnancy, like aspirin and ibuprofen.</p><p>The announcement comes after Kennedy said in April that HHS <span class="link">would undertake</span> a "massive testing and research effort" to determine the cause of autism. Kennedy at the time said the plan was to release a comprehensive report in September. However, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya <span class="link">said later that month</span> it could be as long as a year before the findings are released.</p>
<p>"To meet the president's challenge, I ordered HHS to launch unprecedented, all-agency effort to identify all causes of autism, including toxic and pharmaceutical exposures," Kennedy said.</p><p>FDA Commissioner Marty Makary also announced FDA approval of the drug <span class="link">leucovorin to treat autism</span> in children. It has previously been used off-label for that purpose.</p><p>Autism has become <span class="link">more prevalent</span> in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there is no scientific consensus on the reasons why. Most experts say it is likely due to a combination of factors, including changes in the way the condition is diagnosed.  </p><h2>Tylenol maker responds to autism claims</h2><p>In a statement to CBS News, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said "independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism."</p><p>"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise," the statement continues, highlighting what the company says is the greater health risk for expecting mothers from other conditions if they give up on taking the drug. "Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives."</p><p>"The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism," the company said, adding that it "will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children." </p><h2>Medical experts on acetaminophen and autism research</h2><p>In a statement to CBS News when reports of the administration's plans first surfaced, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) said, "There is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues." </p>
<p>Following the administration's announcement Monday, ACOG President Dr. Steven J. Fleischman said in a statement: "Suggestions that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism are not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients, including those who may need to rely on this beneficial medicine during pregnancy."</p><p>"Today's announcement by HHS is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children," Fleischman said. "It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data."</p><p>"The best evidence does not show an association between Tylenol and autism," said Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. "The medical community, the scientific community has the same consensus, which is that Tylenol, acetaminophen, is safe in pregnancy."</p><p>Gounder said acetaminophen is considered the safest option for treating issues like pain and high fever during pregnancy.</p><p>"If you have a high fever during pregnancy, that can cause neurodevelopment issues in the baby, so you don't want to let that fever go untreated," Gounder explained, adding she's worried that expectant mothers may turn to other options that would be less safe. </p><p>"Will women end up taking other medications like aspirin or ibuprofen during pregnancy? Those actually can be dangerous, especially in the third trimester, you can end up with kidney issues, cardiac issues in the baby," she said.</p><p>While some previous research suggested there could be a possible association between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, those studies involved relatively small groups and did not prove a link. Larger and more robust studies have found no connection.</p>
<p>"Any association between acetaminophen and autism is based on limited, conflicting, and inconsistent science and is premature given the current science," the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement. </p><p>The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents some of the largest makers of over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, said, "Safety is the top priority for manufacturers," and "the well-established profile of acetaminophen is supported by decades of research and real-world use."</p><p>"Scientific and medical authorities around the world recognize acetaminophen as the only analgesic considered safe for use during pregnancy when used according to the Drug Facts label, which specifically reminds pregnant women to always consult their healthcare provider before use," the group said.</p><h2>What is leucovorin?</h2><p>FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said autism "may also be due to an autoimmune reaction to a folate receptor on the brain not allowing that important vitamin to get into the brain cells." </p><p>He announced FDA approval of the drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid (also known as folate or vitamin B9), to treat autism in children. Leucovorin is an inexpensive, generic drug that was previously approved to ease the side effects of cancer chemotherapy. </p><p>Pregnant women are prescribed multivitamins with folic acid to prevent neural tube defects. The neural tube develops into the brain and spinal cord. </p><p>Specialists say <span class="link">leucovorin can be helpful</span> in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.</p>
<p>"You can have a perfectly normal folate level in your blood, but it may not be getting into the brain, and so there's a defect in the transport of folate into the brain. Leucovorin works around that," Gounder explained. "Not all children with autism have this defect, so there's a test you can do to assess whether that's what's at play. For those kids, leucovorin has been shown to help, particularly with speech, getting kids to be more verbal than they were before."</p><p>Leucovorin isn't a cure for autism, but "it could really have a substantial impact on a very good percentage of children with autism," Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, <span class="link">told CBS News earlier this year</span>.</p>

<div class="article-title">"Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to air Tuesday, Disney says</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>After being <span class="link">pulled off the air nearly a week ago</span>, "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return on Tuesday, The Walt Disney Company announced Monday.</p><p>The late-night show had been "pre-empted indefinitely" last week following comments Kimmel made on the show in response to <span class="link">the shooting death</span> of conservative activist <span class="link">Charlie Kirk</span>.</p><p>In a statement Monday, The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, said Kimmel's show was suspended "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country," adding that some of the host's comments were "ill-timed and thus insensitive."</p><p>"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday," Disney said.</p><p>Kimmel had not yet commented on Monday on his show's return.</p>
<p>The late-night host made the remarks in his monologue on Sept. 15, saying: "We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it." He also mocked Mr. Trump's reaction to the shooting.</p><p>Before Disney announced last week that Kimmel's show was "pre-empted indefinitely," Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr called the remarks "some of the sickest conduct possible," and said there was a "path forward for suspension over this."</p><p>"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at," he said during a podcast interview, telling host Benny Johnson: "We can do this the easy way or the hard way."</p><p>Kimmel faced criticism from conservatives over his comments. Mr. Trump last week had congratulated ABC for "finally having the courage to do what had to be done." </p>
<p>ABC parent company Disney has faced fallout in Hollywood over the move: Other <span class="link">late-night hosts</span> have publicly sided with Kimmel, A-listers like Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro signed an open letter calling it a "dark moment for freedom of speech," and screenwriter and "Lost" co-creator Damon Lindelof vowed not to work with Disney unless Kimmel's show is restored. <span class="link">Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner</span>, who led Disney for more than two decades, spoke out and defended Kimmel last week, writing on X: "Where has all the leadership gone? If not for university presidents, law firm managing partners, and corporate chief executives standing up against bullies, who then will step up for the first amendment?" </p><p>Carr's comments on Kimmel drew pushback on First Amendment grounds, with the FCC's sole Democrat-appointed commissioner, Anna Gomez, arguing the agency had used Kimmel's "inopportune joke as a pretext to punish speech it disliked." <span class="link">Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas also sharply criticized Carr</span> for urging ABC to crack down on Kimmel, calling the Trump appointee's comments "dangerous as hell" and "right out of 'Goodfellas.'" Cruz chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.</p><p>ABC's announcement last week came after media giant Nexstar announced that it would preempt Kimmel's show indefinitely on all its stations over Kimmel's remarks. Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division, said the comments were "offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located."</p><p>Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it. A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision was "made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision."</p><p>Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.</p><p>"Regardless of ABC's plans for the future of the program, Sinclair intends not to return 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' to our air until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform," Sinclair said last week in a statement. </p><p>On Monday night, Sinclair posted a statement on X saying it will preempt "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be "replacing it with news programming" beginning Tuesday night. "Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return," Sinclair said.</p>

<div class="article-title">Here's what immigration attorneys say about Trump's $100,000 H-1B fee</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Trump administration's <span class="link">new $100,000 fee</span> for H-1B visa applications is sowing confusion among some immigrant workers and their employers, including whether it's safe for current holders of the visa to travel outside the U.S.</p><p>The new fee, which President Trump announced in a proclamation on Friday, represents a major change to a 35-year-old program that has enabled millions of immigrants to work legally in the U.S. The visa has become a mainstay in the technology industry, including among bellwethers such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, and is also widely used in the financial sector.</p><p>Over the weekend, the White House sought to clarify the new policy, stating that the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and that it is a one-time cost required only when initially applying for the visa.</p><p>White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said the addition of a $100,000 charge for H-1B visas on top of the existing fees reflects President Trump's promise "to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages."</p><p>She added, "The text of the proclamation is very clear, and it is unfortunate that uninformed reporters and corporate lawyers attempt to sow chaos and confusion. Americans have another reason to celebrate unprecedented action by President Trump to protect Americans from cheap foreign labor."</p>
<p>After the White House outlined the new policy on Friday, some tech companies including Google and Microsoft this weekend instructed H-1B employees who were traveling outside the U.S. to return immediately, expressing concern they might not be allowed to re-enter without the $100,000 payment, according to workers and immigration lawyers. </p><p>Despite the White House's clarification that the new fee applies only to new visa applications, not existing H-1B holders, there remains "a great degree of uncertainty on the ground," Parul Koul, president of the union that represents employees at Google owner Alphabet, said during a press conference on Monday to address the new policy. </p><p>CBS News spoke with attorneys and other sources about the new policy — here's what to know. </p><h2>Who pays the $100,000 fee? </h2><p>Under current H-1B rules, employers pay the application fees on behalf of workers. Assuming that approach continues, that could deter many employers from picking up the additional $100,000 fees — roughly 10 times what they previously paid for an applicant, Emily Neumann, an immigration attorney and managing partner at Houston-based Reddy Neumann Brown, told CBS MoneyWatch. </p>
<p>"Very few employers would be willing to shell out that kind of money," she said. </p><p>Such an outcome would appear to align with the White House's goals of spurring employers to hire within the U.S. rather than recruiting foreign workers.</p><p>"It is therefore necessary to impose higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers," Mr. Trump said in his order. </p><h2>When does the fee go into effect? </h2><p>The new fee must be paid in submitting any new H-1B visa application and went into effect at 12:01 am EST on Sept. 21, according to a White House statement. </p><p>Each year, the federal government approves 85,000 H-1B visas for highly skilled non-U.S. workers, who typically require at least a bachelor's degree and a skill in a highly specialized field, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. An estimated 700,000 people in the U.S. hold a H-1B visa, according to Capital Economics.</p><p>The USCIS says it has already reached its applicant cap for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. That means those applications would be excluded from having to pay the fee, but new applicants filing during the next fiscal year would be subject to it, Neumann explained.  </p><h2>What are the main issues for current H-1B holders? </h2><p>According to the White House, the proclamation "does not prevent any holder of a current H-1B visa from traveling in and out of the United States."</p>
<p>H-1B visas are valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years. A White House official said the one-time $100,000 fee is only charged when applying for a visa for the first time — the payment is not required for current visa holders or those renewing the document, and those fees aren't changing. </p><p>Yet the new rules leave some gray areas for current H-1B holders, Neumann said. For instance, the new fee is targeted at new visa applicants residing outside the U.S. That raises questions about whether current H-1B visa holders who are applying for changes, such as a visa renewal or a change of employer, might be caught up in the new requirement if they leave the U.S., Neumann and other immigration attorneys said.</p><p>"Where the question comes in is, what if after September 21 they file that extension and then they need to travel — are they going to be expected to pay that in order to get back into the U.S.?" she said. "That's kind of an open question right now."</p><p>Although the White House said the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and won't impact their travel, Neumann said she believes more guidance is needed because the White House's Sept. 21 FAQ notes the fee applies to "any other H-1B petitions submitted after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025."</p><p>"This makes it sound like it could apply to an employee who travels with any petition filed after September 21, 2025. Although it seems clear that it does not apply to individuals currently in the United States, it is not clear how it impacts those who later travel and have a petition filed after the relevant date," she said.</p><p>For now, Neumann said she is advising her corporate clients to direct their H-1B employees not to leave the U.S.. That was echoed by Jeff Joseph, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association and an immigration attorney.</p><p>"Until we have more clarification, which hopefully we'll have soon, we're telling people to just sit tight and not travel," Joseph said.</p>
<p>Asked about the issue of H-1B holders who are applying for a change and who travel outside the U.S., the White House said the one-time $100,000 fee doesn't apply to renewals or current visa holders.</p><h2>How does the new fee impact the H-1B program? </h2><p>The $100,000 fee is likely to have a "chilling effect" on skilled foreign workers moving to the U.S.<strong>,</strong> Joseph of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said.</p><p>Although the tech industry has long been the biggest beneficiary of the H-1B program, the visa is designed for highly skilled workers across many industries, he added. Employers who rely on the visa include those in health care, which often recruit medical professionals outside the U.S. in areas where they have shortages, he said.</p><p>More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders come from a range of countries, including Canada, South Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a 2022 USCIS report.</p><h2>What about the national security exemption?</h2><p>A provision in Mr. Trump's proclamation exempts some workers, companies and even entire industries from the new $100,000 fee if they are deemed to support the "national interest" and are adjudged not to pose a threat to the security or welfare of the U.S. </p><p>For now, however, it's unclear how to receive such an exemption, including which federal agency will be charged with approving them, Neumann said. </p><p>"There's no guidance out there yet," she said. "What are the national interest exemptions going to be? How would a company apply for that, if they can get the entire company to get the exemption? How would the individual apply?"</p>
<p>The White House didn't respond to questions about how the national security exemption would be applied or which agency will be handling the issue.</p>

<div class="article-title">Shrimp sold in 31 states recalled due to possible radioactive contamination</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>AquaStar (USA) Corp. is recalling more than 85,000 bags of shrimp due to insanitary conditions where the products may have been contaminated with cesium-137, a radioactive element.</p><p>In an alert posted Sunday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the recall included approximately 49,920 bags of "Kroger Raw Colossal EZ Peel Shrimp," approximately 18,000 bags of "Kroger Mercado Cooked Medium Peeled Tail-Off Shrimp" and approximately 17,264 bags of AquaStar Raw Peeled Tail-on Shrimp Skewers.</p><p>The items were sold between June 12 and Sept. 17, 2025, at several retail locations including Kroger, Ralphs, Fred Meyer, Fry's, King Soopers and more across 31 states, including: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Wyoming.</p><p>Specific UPC and lot codes as well as photos of the recalled shrimp products can be found on the FDA's website.</p><p>While the shrimp could be contaminated with a radioactive isotope called cesium-137, the FDA said that no products as of yet have tested positive for it.</p>
<p>Cesium-137, or cs-137, is the radioactive form of the element cesium, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Produced by nuclear fission, it's used in medical devices and is also a byproduct of nuclear fission in nuclear reactors and weapons testing, the EPA says. </p><p>"The primary health effect of concern following longer term, repeated low dose exposure (e.g., through consumption of contaminated food or water over time) is an elevated risk of cancer, resulting from damage to DNA within living cells of the body," the FDA announcement stated. </p><p>So far, no illnesses have been reported, according to the FDA, but consumers who purchased any affected shrimp should not consume it. Instead, the agency advises disposing the product or returning it to the place of purchase for refund. </p><p>The products were imported from Indonesian company PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati, which was also responsible for <span class="link">a recent recall of frozen shrimp sold at Walmart</span>.</p>
<p>The agency said it issued the warning about Walmart's Great Value shrimp after it had detected cesium-137 in a single shipment of frozen shrimp from PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati.</p><p>In the latest alert, the FDA reshared a statement from the previous recall, which stated no product testing positive with cesium-137 has entered the U.S. commerce at this time. </p>

<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>The Army has released the names of <span class="link">four soldiers who were killed lasat week</span> when the military helicopter they were on <span class="link">crashed</span> near Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state.</p><p>The victims are chief warrant officers Andrew Cully and Andrew Kraus, and sergeants Donavon Scott and Jadalyn Good, the Army said Monday in a release.</p><p>Cully, 35, was from Sparta, Missouri. Kraus, 39, was from Sanibel, Florida. Scott, 25, was from Tacoma, Washington, and Good, 23, was from Mount Vernon, Washington.</p><p>They were part of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, an elite team that does nighttime missions, when their MH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crashed at about 9 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 17.  </p>
<p>The helicopter was on a routine flight training west of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, according to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command. The base is about 10 miles south of Tacoma under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Joint Base Headquarters.</p>
<p>The cause of the crash remains under investigation. The skies in the area were mostly clear with light winds from the south around the time of the crash, according to the National Weather Service.</p><p>Cully was commissioned in May 2013 as a U.S. Army aviation officer from Missouri State University and was deployed to serve in Operation Atlantic Resolve and Operation Swift Response, according to the Army. Kraus joined the Army in 2017 and has supported multiple training missions and deployed in support of contingency response operations. Scott enlisted in the Army as a UH-60 helicopter repairer, and has served on two support missions to Operation Inherent Resolve. Good served as a helicopter maintainer and was "instrumental in the success" of numerous training missions, the Army said.</p><p>All four soldiers earned multiple awards, including the Meritorious Service Medal and the Army Service Ribbon.</p><p>The soldiers "embodied the unwavering dedication, selflessness, and excellence that define the very spirit of the Army and Army Special Operations," Col.

<div class="article-title">What the research says about Tylenol and autism</div>
<div class="article-source">CBS News</div>
<html><body><div><section class="content__body">
<p>Recent reports in the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal say President Trump and Health Secretary <span class="link">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</span> are <span class="link">expected to announce</span> that the use of Tylenol by pregnant women may be linked to autism in children. But many top medical experts in the field say the evidence does not support that.</p><p>This comes after Kennedy said in April that HHS <span class="link">would undertake</span> a "massive testing and research effort" to determine the cause of autism. Kennedy at the time said the plan was to release a comprehensive report in September. However, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya <span class="link">said later that month</span> the findings could take up to a year.</p><p>Kennedy has in the past made the unfounded claim that autism is a "preventable disease," drawing heavy criticism from many medical experts, who say evidence shows there are multiple factors, including genetics, that play a role. </p><p>In a statement provided to CBS News on Sept. 5, an HHS spokesperson said, "We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America's unprecedented rise in autism rates. Until we release the final report, any claims about its contents are nothing more than speculation."</p><h2>What does Tylenol maker Kenvue say about autism?</h2><p>In response to the WSJ story on Sept. 5, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol — whose active ingredient is acetaminophen — said: "We have continuously evaluated the science and continue to believe there is no causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and leading medical organizations agree on the safety of acetaminophen, its use during pregnancy, and the information provided on the label."</p>
<p>Kenvue added, "We appreciate the Secretary acknowledging media coverage on the upcoming HHS report is 'nothing more than speculation.'" </p><p>In another statement on Sept. 21, the company said:</p><blockquote><p>"We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.</p><p>Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives. </p><p>The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism. We stand with the many public health and medical professionals who have reviewed this science and agree. We will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children."</p></blockquote><h2>What do medical experts say?</h2><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement provided to CBS News that "there is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues." </p><p>"Neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular, are multifactorial and very difficult to associate with a singular cause," ACOG said. "Pregnant patients should not be frightened away from the many benefits of acetaminophen, which is safe and one of the few options pregnant people have for pain relief."</p>
<p>Dr. Christopher Zahn, ACOG's chief of clinical practice, said, "Pregnant patients should not be frightened away from the many benefits of acetaminophen, which is safe and one of the few options pregnant people have for pain relief."</p><p>"If you have a high fever during pregnancy, that can cause neurodevelopment issues in the baby, so you don't want to let that fever go untreated," said Dr. Céline Goudner, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. She said pregnant women should talk with their OB-GYN, especially if they're needing it frequently, and use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time.</p><p>While some research suggested there could be a possible association between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, those studies involved relatively small groups and did not prove a link. Larger and more robust studies have found no connection between acetaminophen and autism.</p><p>"I spoke this afternoon to a researcher who was part of a major study published just last year that followed 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years," CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said after the WSJ report came out. "He said use of acetaminophen ... was not associated with an increased risk of autism in children." </p><p>LaPook said he is looking forward to reading the upcoming report pledged by Kennedy, "especially the evidence behind any conclusions and recommendations."</p><p>Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there is no scientific consensus on the reasons why.  </p><p>Research shows the causes of autism "are complex," Dr. Christine Ladd-Acosta, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the vice director for the Wendy Klag Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities, told CBS News in an interview.</p>
<p>"There have been a few dozen studies looking at Tylenol and whether use during pregnancy is associated with risk of autism in those women's children, and the evidence has been really kind of conflicting," Ladd-Acosta said. "Some studies have shown no association. Some have shown a positive association. Some have shown negative associations. And I think part of that is because it's really hard to tease apart ... whether it's the medication itself that is influencing autism risk in the child, or if it has to do with the condition ... the mother is using the medicine to treat that is the thing that is important in autism risk." </p><p>Ladd-Acosta noted that the dosage, the length of time that pregnant women take Tylenol, and the "specific condition" they are taking it for are all factors that have been considered when attempting to determine if there is a potential association between the medication and autism. </p><p>"There have been some associations, but there has been no conclusive evidence I've seen to show that Tylenol itself causes autism definitively," Ladd-Acosta said. </p>

<div class="article-title">Did Amazon trick people into paying for Prime? Federal case goes to trial</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Amazon and the U.S. government are facing off in a Seattle courtroom over Prime, the company's lucrative subscription service. The government alleges that the company "tricked" people into paying for Prime memberships that were purposefully hard to cancel.</p> <p>The lawsuit marks one of the biggest federal cases pursuing one of the world's largest companies. Somewhat unusually for a dense antitrust case, a jury will determine whether Amazon broke the law. Oral arguments are expected to begin on Tuesday in the trial that's slated to last for nearly a month. </p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission has accused Amazon of violating consumer-protection and competition laws in how it got people to sign up for Prime, the subscription service that costs $139 a year or $14.99 a month. Amazon denies any wrongdoing.</p> <p>In 2021, the company said more than 200 million people worldwide subscribed to Prime. That was the last time it publicly disclosed membership figures.</p> <p>This Prime case is a prelude to the FTC's second and sweeping lawsuit that has accused Amazon of functioning as a monopoly. Amazon has said that suit is "wrong on the facts and on the law." That trial is slated for early 2027, in front of the same judge, John Chun of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Government says Amazon knew it trapped people</h3> <p>The FTC alleges that millions of people signed up for Prime unintentionally thanks to Amazon's use of what's known as dark patterns, which the lawsuit describes as "manipulative design elements that trick users into making decisions they would not otherwise have made."</p> <p>One example regulators offered showed a large yellow button "Get FREE Two-Day Shipping" as a swift way to sign up without much detail about recurring membership costs, while a small blue hyperlink "No thanks, I do not want fast, free shipping" would avoid signing up for Prime.</p>
<p>And on the other end, the FTC describes a "four-page, six-click, fifteen-option" journey to cancel a Prime membership, which it alleges Amazon employees internally called the "Iliad Flow," referring to the epic ancient Greek poem about the long and arduous Trojan war.</p>
<p>"Millions of consumers accidentally enrolled in Prime without knowledge or consent," the FTC says in its trial brief, "but Amazon refused to fix this known problem, described internally by employees as an 'unspoken cancer' because clarity adjustments would lead to a drop in subscribers."</p> <h3 class="edTag">Amazon says it acts like other subscription services</h3> <p>Amazon argues its Prime members are drawn by the program's benefits, not design tricks. It says its designs and disclosures are in line with — or even clearer than — the rest of the subscription industry.</p>
<p>"Occasional customer frustrations and mistakes are inevitable — especially for a program as popular as Amazon Prime," the company's trial brief says. "Evidence that a small percentage of customers misunderstood Prime enrollment or cancellation does not prove that Amazon violated the law."</p>
<p>Amazon says the law does not define the term "dark patterns," and the FTC is attempting to apply a broad law against fraud through interpretation. Andrea Matwyshyn, Pennsylvania State University law professor who's advised the FTC in the past, says the law is intentionally broad to give regulators leeway for the latest technology or business practices.</p> <p>"The question is when design crosses the line into a situation where a reasonable consumer does not have a fair shot of understanding what's going on," Matwyshyn says.</p> <p>Amazon is also defending three of its executives who were personally named in the FTC's lawsuit as individuals alongside the company as a whole.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Judge questions Amazon's legal tactics</h3> <p>In July, Judge Chun formally admonished Amazon lawyers for some of their legal tactics in the lawsuit.</p> <p>The FTC accused Amazon of hiding incriminating evidence by gratuitously marking filings as privileged. After Amazon re-reviewed its privilege logs, the company withdrew almost all of its privilege claims and produced nearly 70,000 documents to the FTC on the eve of the cutoff date for discovery.</p>
<p>The judge wrote that this conduct was "tantamount to bad faith" and appeared motivated by "the  <br/>desire to gain a tactical advantage."</p> <p>Judge Chun has sided with the FTC in several other procedural rulings; he has also denied Amazon's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The FTC's investigation of Amazon began during the first Trump administration. The agency did not file its lawsuit until 2023, however, when it was under the leadership of Lina Khan, the firebrand Biden appointee.</p> <p><em>Amazon is an NPR financial supporter and pays to distribute some of our content.</em></p>

<div class="article-title">How to reintegrate over a million veterans? Groups in Ukraine are working on it</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>LVIV and SAMAR, Ukraine — During a CrossFit class, one man slowly, methodically, pulls weights down from a machine. He's in the class, but he isn't fully participating; he's not doing the same exercises as the others, or chatting with them during breaks. Andriy Khrystiuk, 52, only just arrived in Lviv, a big city in western Ukraine, a few days ago. He's a veteran, and trying to recover from wartime mental trauma.</p> <p>Every night Khrystiuk says when he closes his eyes his dreams take him right back to the front lines. "I often wake up all sweaty because I wake up from combat. In my dreams I still participate," he says.</p>
<p>Khrystiuk was a sniper in northeastern Ukraine's Kupiansk area until he was injured in an attack in May 2024. His right ribs were broken and his right lung was punctured as armor-piercing bullets went in one side and out the other. Bits of the ceramic plate from his ballistic vest were lodged into his chest.</p>
<p>After a long and difficult recovery process, Khrystiuk tried to go home — alone. He is divorced and his son was killed in the war. "Nobody waits for me there. It's emptiness," he says.</p> <p>Occasionally, despite the dangers, he would drive supplies back to Kupiansk, to the front lines, to feel useful. He felt closer to his comrades on the front than to anyone in the community. He was lonely, and struggling to reintegrate into civilian life.</p> <p>Just over a year after his injury, Khrystiuk is staying at a facility with other recovering veterans in Lviv because, he says, his "roof was leaking" — a Ukrainian metaphor for being mentally unstable.</p>
<p>There are more than a million veterans in Ukraine, according to the Ministry of Veterans Affairs. Many have physical and mental trauma from participating in combat, and Ukrainians are gearing up to tackle the issue of how to support them.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Supporting veterans</h3><h3 class="edTag"></h3> <p>Early this year, Khrystiuk received an invitation to join a program called the Lviv Habilitation Center. </p> <p>Though the program is small, people from all over the country who have been traumatized in some way by the war are invited. It serves as a place, after rehab, that veterans can grow used to their new life, come to terms with their trauma and learn new ways to live with their disabilities both mentally and physically. And, as Khrystiuk describes it, "Emotionally in this place you can take load off your chest a bit." </p>
<p>The kitchen is modified to work for people with a range of disabilities including wheelchair users and those using canes. A full-size gym helps people with physical rehab. Regular mental health sessions, and a number of programs including language courses and city outings in Lviv, all aim to help people reintegrate into civilian life.</p> <p>Serhiy Titarenko, a 40-year-old veteran himself, leads the program. When he was discharged from the military in 2018 after an injury left him with no feeling from the chest down. He says he remembers being left on the street outside the hospital in a wheelchair that he didn't know how to use. He wasn't given tools to learn how to build a new life in this condition.</p>
<p>A psychologist now, Titarenko says there is a concerning rise in veteran suicide, mental health issues and addictive behaviors like drug use and gambling.</p> <p>The habilitation facility can only host 20 veterans at a time, each staying three weeks. But Titarenko is eager to teach veterans what he learned and set up more programs across the country.</p> <p>It's not just veterans who need help adjusting to this new reality in Ukraine. When the habilitation program opened in the residential area where it's located, some area residents asked if the center could cover the gym's floor-to-ceiling windows, "because they don't want to see disabled people," Titarenko says. But he refused, and instead he invited community members in to tour the center and meet the veterans. And he takes the veterans for walks around Lviv to increase interaction and engagement with the community. "We invited these people, our neighbors — civilians, to our center ... for understanding how they want to talk to us veterans, how they must develop, how they must see," Titarenko says.</p>
<p>Despite Titarenko's efforts on a small scale, many Ukrainian veterans told NPR that they don't feel like civilians understand them and their experiences after returning from the battlefield, and they don't feel comfortable seeking out professional help.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Supporting communities</h3> <p>Yuliia Krat is the lead psychologist at East SOS, a Ukrainian NGO that is helping with veteran reintegration. She says she is trying to tackle this divide between the community and veterans with a new training program that she's rolling out in cities and towns in Dnipro region, in central Ukraine.</p>
<p>The training is directed at community leaders, social workers, civil servants and others who may have frequent interactions with veterans. It starts by explaining, "what you experience in war leaves its mark, changes a person and their values."</p> <p>Krat is doing this in hopes that civilians understand that the return home of millions of veterans is not just a veteran problem, but it's an issue that Ukrainian society must face as a whole. "My idea is that we as a society need to become commonly responsible for this challenge that we have now. And we cannot just, like, close our eyes and ... leave this responsibility on somebody else," Krat says.</p>
<p>That's not the only reason a community-targeted approach can be helpful. Even from his place at the Lviv Habilitation Center, Khrystiuk still worries about veterans who haven't found the kind of support that he did. "A lot of people are afraid of places like this. They are afraid to move out somewhere," he says. "They choose the 'glass' [starting to drink]. Also there are places that don't have these recovery centers and veteran spaces."</p> <p>Veteran Andriy Melnykov, 57, lives in Samar, a city in the Dnipro region. When he was discharged last year, he says, he was depressed and drinking alcohol every day. The first six months were especially difficult. "I was on the booze and sleep," he says. "I didn't know what to do with myself. Like I had no idea what to do next."</p>
<p>It was his daughter, Arina Melnykov, who snapped him out of it. She's 15 and says that time is too difficult to talk about. Now they're at a community center in Samar with a group of veterans that gets together to play table tennis every week, he's stopped drinking, and he and his daughter regularly go biking together as well.</p>
<p>The Melnykovs were lucky. Many families, much less a teenager, don't necessarily know how to handle a veteran struggling with returning home to civilian life.</p>
<p>To Krat this is part of the reason the community-focused approach is so vital. Veterans often struggle to ask for help, and rely on family and community members for support instead. "And this is why it makes it so difficult to work with them directly because they simply block, they refuse to work with you," Krat says. Even training 10 psychologists for every district, she says, wouldn't be productive because many veterans wouldn't go to them. "That's why we try to give this knowledge to everyone in their surroundings, in their environment, so they can get this help even without knowing it," says Krat.</p> <p>Still, the Ukrainians initiating these programs around veterans aren't sure they can meet the amount of need. "I don't know if it's even possible to be ready for something like this," Krat says.</p> <p>But she also won't say it's impossible, and plans to continue building her community training program and spread information about how to support veterans as far as she can.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">5 takeaways from Kamala Harris' new book about her sprint for the presidency</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris' new memoir, <em>107 days,</em> is out Tuesday with a mix of insights and unanswered questions about her historically short run for president after former President Joe Biden dropped out. </p> <p>Harris has largely been out of the public spotlight since losing the election to Donald Trump last November, but the book release kicks off a cross-country tour.</p> <p>Here are five takeaways:</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>1. Harris believes she was loyal to the Bidens, but says the feeling wasn't mutual</strong></h3> <p>Loyalty is one of the underlying themes in Harris' book. It's even laid out in one of the introduction quotes before the memoir begins from Kendrick Lamar's "DNA": "I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA."</p>
<p>Harris writes of times that Biden, his family and his senior staff in the West Wing questioned whether Harris truly was loyal, while her own frustrations mounted from the president's staff not speaking up to defend her from outside criticism. </p> <p>In the tumultuous weeks after Biden's disastrous debate performance last summer — when high-profile Democrats began to question his ability to beat Trump — first lady Jill Biden pulled aside Harris' husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, to ask if they were standing by the Bidens. Harris says that irked Emhoff. </p> <p>In another instance, two months into Harris' bid, right as she was about to get on the debate stage, Harris writes that Biden called her. He wished her luck — but then spent time on the call asking if she was bashing him to "powerbrokers."</p> <p>"I just couldn't understand why he would call me, right now, and make it all about himself," she writes.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Biden declined to comment.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>2. She doesn't directly say that Biden shouldn't have run for a second term</strong></h3> <p>Harris doesn't make any comment in the book on whether Biden should have run for a second term at all. She defends his mental capacity to serve as president but writes that Biden's staff mismanaged his fatigue and worsened the issue.</p>
<p>By the time last summer's debate debacle came around, and questions mounted on whether Biden should stay in the race, she says, she was in the "worst position" to tell Biden to drop out.</p> <p>"He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty, even if my only message was: Don't let the other guy win," Harris writes.</p>
<p>She writes that she perhaps should have told Biden in the aftermath of the debate to drop out, but that "maybe he was right" to think voters would support him in a second match-up against Trump. In the end, Harris says, it was "Joe and Jill's decision."</p> <p>But Harris acknowledges in the book that it was "recklessness" to leave the decision of whether Biden should drop out to the Bidens themselves. "It should have been more than a personal decision."</p> <p>In an interview on MSNBC Monday night, Harris admitted, "I have and had a certain responsibility that I should have followed through on. … When I talk about the recklessness, as much as anything, I'm talking about myself."</p>
<p>Harris notes that throughout her run, she struggled to distance herself from Biden and his legacy — like when she told ABC's <em>The View</em> that she wouldn't have done anything different than Biden in their years in office.</p> <p>She says at one point, her adviser David Plouffe didn't mince words: "People hate Joe Biden," he said.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>3. Her first choice as running mate was Pete Buttigieg</strong></h3> <p>Harris reveals that Pete Buttigieg, her former 2020 political rival who served as transportation secretary in the Biden administration, is a close friend and was her first choice for running mate. She compliments Buttigieg as a savvy communicator and says he would have been an "ideal partner," but she had reservations about whether Americans would accept a ticket with a Black woman married to a Jewish man alongside a gay man.</p>
<p>Buttigieg responded in a statement to Politico, "My experience in politics has been that the way that you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you're going to do for their lives, not on categories."</p>
<p>Harris instead chose Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, who Harris says made clear from the start that he had no presidential ambitions. It was a contrast to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, whom Harris is critical of in her book and paints as too ambitious for being a No. 2. She says Shapiro asked one of her staffers about how many rooms the VP's residence had, and on the way in for his final interview, wondered how he could get work from Pennsylvania artists sent to the house.</p> <p>She muses that Shapiro tried to call her to withdraw himself as a contender right before she named Walz because he knew he wouldn't be her choice.</p> <p>Shapiro's spokesperson Manuel Bonder said in a statement, "it's simply ridiculous to suggest that Governor Shapiro was focused on anything other than defeating Donald Trump. … The conclusion of this process was a deeply personal decision for both him and the Vice President."</p>
<h3 class="edTag"></h3><h3 class="edTag"><strong>4. She is still trying to tell her own backstory</strong></h3> <p>Harris has typically been a buttoned-up politician, especially when it comes to sharing personal anecdotes. In the memoir, though, she's more candid and reveals some of the personal struggles and stresses of her run for president — like the toll it took on her relationship with Emhoff.</p> <p>But in most other parts of the book, it seems Harris is still trying to tell her own story to the public — something the campaign was pressed to do in a short window of time last year after Biden dropped out. After three and a half years of being a vice president that largely left her in the shadows, Harris spent several weeks on the campaign trail trying to reintroduce herself to the country in her own words.</p>
<p>The book is peppered with familiar stump speech lines from Harris, along with explanations about her decision to become a prosecutor and lessons from her mother.</p> <p>She also recounts her time as vice president meeting with foreign leaders like Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as leading on issues like gun violence prevention from the White House.</p> <h3 class="edTag"><strong>5. What's next for Harris is still unanswered</strong></h3> <p>In the last few pages of her book, Harris gives some vague ideas for what she sees as the path forward for Democrats, and for the country.</p>
<p>"We need to come up with our own blueprint that sets out our alternative vision for our country," Harris writes, adding that "the heart" of her vision is investing in educating Gen Z.</p>
<p>While she touches on the topics of transgender athletes and Israel's war in Gaza in the book, Harris doesn't offer any suggestions for how the party should handle specific issues going forward. Besides noting that she wants to "be with the people" and hear their ideas, Harris also doesn't indicate what her own future in politics will look like. She does say that the answer for what's next, though, won't come from Washington.</p> <p>Her book tour, which kicks off Wednesday in New York, will include nearly 20 stops around the country, as well as London and Toronto.</p>

<div class="article-title">Georgia senators demand answers on more than a dozen deaths in immigration detention</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Georgia's Democratic senators are asking Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to provide more information on recent deaths in immigration detention centers, including the conditions of detainees.</p> <p>Since President Trump took office, 15 people have died in immigration detention, 10 of those deaths occurred between January and June,<strong> </strong>Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock wrote in a letter shared exclusively with NPR. The senators say that is the highest rate in the first six months of any year publicly available.</p> <p>"Whatever our views on border enforcement, immigration enforcement, immigration policy, I think the overwhelming majority of the American people does not want detainees abused while they're in U.S. custody," Ossoff told NPR in an interview.</p>
<p>The Homeland Security Department is rushing to expand detention space and increase the rates of arrests after Congress provided billions of dollars in additional funding. Across the country, reports of overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and issues with food and healthcare access have been the product of a focus to make more arrests. NPR has reached out to DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment.</p>
<p>The letter follows a report Ossoff released in July that alleges human rights violations occurred at immigration detention centers, including mistreatment of children, citizens and pregnant women. DHS broadly refuted the claims.</p> <p>Earlier this year, ICE officials announced the agency was out of detention space. By the summer, over 50,000 people were in detention but ICE only had 46,000 beds.</p> <p>Since then, ICE has announced expanded detention space through the use of military bases and state partnerships in Indiana, Nebraska, and Louisiana.</p> <p>But the rapid expansion and use of other facilities has drawn criticism from immigration advocates and Democrats.</p> <p>Concern over conditions in detention also comes after DHS cut jobs in the oversight divisions focused on civil rights. This included widespread cuts within the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which conducts oversight of ICE and Customs and Border Protection detention.</p>
<p>Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons was asked about deaths in custody and delays in reports during a Congressional oversight hearing in May.</p> <p>"We do conduct a thorough investigation of all of those," Lyons said, adding that he would ensure that information on deaths in custody were publicly available online in accordance with Congressional mandates. "ICE is dedicated to transparency."</p> <p>In the letter, Ossoff and Warnock reiterate the concern of delayed reporting of death.</p> <p>"ICE is failing to meet its own standards for reporting detainee deaths, thereby hindering Congressional oversight efforts and leaving families in the dark as to their loved ones' fates," they wrote, adding that ICE guidance requires the agency to post an interim notice of any detainee death to ICE's website "within 48 hours," and directs that "every effort should be made to post the interim notice" sooner.</p> <p>Most recently, ICE issued press releases confirming the death of a Mexican national on Aug. 31. The public statement was released two days after his death.<strong> </strong>Another detainee died on Sept. 8, and the release was issued seven days later. Neither is yet on an official ICE detainee death tracker. Another man, who was detained by ICE, died on Thursday in Nassau County, according to local reports.<br/></p>

<div class="article-title">Judge orders Trump administration to restore $500 million in grant funding to UCLA</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>LOS ANGELES — A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding that it froze at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p> <p>U.S. District Judge Rita Lin in San Francisco granted a preliminary injunction on Monday, saying the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires specific procedures and explanations for federal funding cuts. Instead, the government informed UCLA in generalized form letters that multiple grants from various agencies were being suspended but offered no specific details.</p> <p>In August, UCLA announced that the Trump administration had suspended $584 million in federal grants over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.</p>
<p>Lin issued a ruling later that month that resulted in $81 million in grants from the National Science Foundation being restored to UCLA. She ruled that those cuts had violated a June preliminary injunction where she ordered the National Science Foundation to restore dozens of grants that it had terminated at the University of California, which operates 10 campuses across the state.</p> <p>The White House did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment on Monday's ruling.</p> <p>The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.</p> <p>Two Ivy League institutions, Columbia and Brown, struck deals to preserve funding that was held up by the Trump administration over similar claims that they had not done enough to respond to campus antisemitism.</p> <p>In the case of Harvard, which pushed back with a lawsuit over cuts to its funding, a federal judge in early September ruled the funding freeze amounted to illegal retaliation for Harvard's rejection of the Trump administration's demands.</p>
<p>The Trump administration had proposed to settle its investigation into UCLA through a $1 billion payment from the institution. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called it an extortion attempt.</p> <p>UCLA has said that such a large payment would "devastate" the institution.</p> <p>Monday's ruling concerns hundreds of medical research grants from the National Institutes of Health that include studies into Parkinson's disease treatment, cancer recovery, cell regeneration in nerves and other areas that campus leaders argue are pivotal for improving the health of Americans.</p>

<div class="article-title">Jimmy Kimmel will be back on air on Tuesday, Disney says</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>Less than a week after it was taken off the air under pressure from the Trump administration, <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> will return to late night on Tuesday, ABC parent company Disney confirmed.</p> <p>Disney pulled the comedian's show last Wednesday after Brendan Carr, chair of the Federal Communications Commission, condemned Kimmel's comments about Charlie Kirk's assassination. The comments in question from Kimmel: "We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it."</p>
<p>Carr threatened Disney and ABC affiliates that carry Kimmel's show, encouraging stations to preempt the late night program. Nexstar, which owns stations across the country and needs FCC approval for a multibillion dollar merger with media company TEGNA, quickly pulled the program.</p> <p>"Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country," Disney explained in a statement provided to NPR. The company cited concerns that "some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive."</p>
<p>After engaging in "thoughtful conversations with Jimmy," Disney stated that they have decided to resume production of the show.</p> <p>Kimmel's suspension sparked widespread outrage. On Monday, hundreds of entertainers, including <em>Hamilton </em>creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and current Marvel and Star Wars star Pedro Pascal — both with long-standing professional ties to Disney — signed an open letter condemning the company's decision. The letter, issued in collaboration with the ACLU, also included signatures from Selena Gomez and Olivia Rodrigo, both of whom found early success as Disney actors.</p> <p>The letter stated in part, "This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees … Regardless of our political affiliation, or whether we engage in politics or not, we all love our country. We also share the belief that our voices should never be silenced by those in power – because if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us."</p>

<div class="article-title">Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>President Trump is openly directing the Justice Department to go after his political adversaries, adding to a sense of unease inside the department about job security and ethical obligations.</p> <p>Even in an era of nonstop social media posts, Trump's weekend update stopped many government attorneys in their tracks. The president said he wanted to see justice served. </p> <p>"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility," he wrote.</p> <p>What Trump said couldn't wait are criminal investigations of his most prominent critics: former FBI Director Jim Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff. </p>
<p>His post emerged only hours after the top federal prosecutor in northern Virginia left his job under pressure. Erik Siebert had worked closely with Trump's top DOJ leaders this year, but he concluded he could not seek criminal charges the president wanted against James.</p> <p>Now Lindsey Halligan, who had been serving as a special assistant to the president, was sworn in Monday as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, though she has no prosecutorial experience. Most recently, she's been helping Trump remove what he calls "improper ideology" from the Smithsonian museums.</p> <p>"This attorney general sent a memo on Day 1 that made it clear that Justice Department lawyers were the president's lawyers, and we are now seeing how that's playing out and how dangerous it is — how it disintegrates the rule of law," Stacey Young, a former DOJ attorney who now leads a group called Justice Connection that helps Justice Department workers, said of Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p> <p>Already this year thousands of employees have left the Justice Department through dismissals and forced resignations. Nearly all of the public integrity unit is gone, as are three in four lawyers in the civil rights division. </p> <p>Many people inside the department are afraid, Young said. After all, she said, if the president is willing to fire a prosecutor for not pursuing his enemies, anybody at the department could get fired. </p>
<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was understandably frustrated with lawmakers and state officials who investigated him.</p> <p>"The president is fulfilling his promise to restore a Department of Justice that demands accountability, and it is not weaponizing the Department of Justice to demand accountability for those who weaponize the Department of Justice," Leavitt said.</p> <p>The Justice Department has traditionally operated with some measure of distance from the White House on criminal investigations. But that distance seems to have closed this year in a way that feels different to longtime observers.</p>
<p>During the presidency of Richard Nixon, public servants at the DOJ felt squeezed between what the president wanted and what the law required. But even Nixon was not as clear and open as Trump is now about what he wanted to happen.</p> <p>"In this situation you have a president who is openly, brazenly bragging about his ability to seek retribution against his political enemies," said George Washington University law professor Stephen Saltzburg.</p> <p>Saltzburg said it looks as if the Trump White House is insisting career prosecutors use their power to make life hell for people who challenge Trump — and on the other side of the coin, to drop investigations or pardon people who support the president, including the people who rioted at the U.S. Capitol four years ago.</p> <p>Trump's political appointees took an oath to support and defend the Constitution when they arrived on the job. That oath may soon be put to the test, if it hasn't already, Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith wrote recently in his newsletter Executive Functions. </p> <p>"The Article II truism about presidential power cannot justify continued service to a president and administration openly indifferent to law," Goldsmith wrote. "That is an issue of personal and professional ethics and integrity."</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors decide which defendants to charge, and when and where. But there are still some outside checks on that power. In recent weeks, grand juries in Washington, D.C., have refused to indict people, and magistrate judges have turned away requests for search warrants. </p> <p>That skepticism, which followed the federal occupation of D.C., may carry over into other cases. Take the claims by Trump's critics of selective or vindictive prosecution, for example.</p> <p>In the past, there's been a very high bar to succeed in court on that allegation. But now that Trump is so open about his demands, judges may think differently.</p>
<p>"I think the president's announcement of what he wants the Justice Department to do is so out of line with our history of promoting equal justice under law and fairness that I don't think that any federal judge is going to look at this and be happy about what the president is doing," Saltzburg said.</p>

<div class="article-title">July 4 wildfire in Grand Canyon still burning, questions about response still unanswered</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>The Grand Canyon's remote North Rim seems like a world away from its more famous South Rim, only a sliver of the nearly five million people who visit the national park each year make it here.</p> <p>At 8,000 feet above sea level, the North Rim's broad plateaus that drop into the canyon are thickly forested with pine trees. </p> <p>Businesses of any kind are few and far between, making places like the Jacob Lake Inn a sort of beacon in the wilderness. It offers the only fresh cookies for at least 25 miles in any direction, and on a recent bustling Sunday morning visitors lined up at the counter for these famous delicacies. One couple eagerly ordered a chocolate chip and a chocolate parfait, and for good measure, an apple turnover for breakfast.</p>
<p>But two months ago, it was very different scene at Jacob Lake. Employees, guests and residents were forced to hastily evacuate as a wildfire bore down.</p> <p>Melinda Rich Marshall's great-grandparents opened the inn more than 100 years ago. The business, which also includes a restaurant and a gift shop filled with Native American jewelry and other curios, largely depends on visitors to the national park. Over the years it has seen its share of wildfires.</p> <p>"In my lifetime, I can think of, like, six that have created economic problems for our family and for Jacob Lake," says Rich Marshall.</p>
<p>Days after they evacuated, a second blaze, the Dragon Bravo Fire, exploded in size, closing the North Rim indefinitely. Rich Marshall says she's had to refund about $350,000 in reservations.</p> <p>"We don't even know how to imagine what the winter's going to be like because we don't know how we're going to actually make it through financially," she says. "Right now, we're just really trying to be creative just like our ancestors were."</p> <p>Scores of local businesses in northern Arizona's national park gateway communities like Jacob Lake have felt the pinch after a particularly damaging wildfire season. More than 200,000 acres burned on the north side of the Grand Canyon alone in July and August. Rich Marshall and others are pressing officials to reopen some North Rim viewpoints in hopes for a return of tourists this fall.</p>
<p>But the ecological affects of the Dragon Bravo Fire may be less dire than initially feared.</p> <h3 class="edTag">'Good for forest health'</h3> <p>"When we came into this, we were expecting to look at devastation," says TJ Clifford, who led a crew of federal specialists known as a Burned Area Emergency Response Team. "So, I was more buoyant as soon as I flew over it and said, 'Okay, we can do this.'"</p> <p>The BAER Team includes soil specialists, botanists, wildlife biologists and others who assess a wide variety of possible wildfire damage to the national park and adjacent national forest. Clifford says their analysis found that nearly three-quarters of the area inside the Dragon Bravo Fire's perimeter either did not burn or burned at a low severity. And while some stretches do resemble a moonscape with charred vegetation and thick ash coating the ground, he expects most of the area to recover quickly.</p> <p>"My overall opinion is this was a good tool for forest health," he says. "It's providing the diversity that we need out there. It's also showing that past fuels treatments and past wildfire did a good thing for preventing that devastating impact."</p> <p>Fire managers in the West often let lightning-caused wildfires burn under certain conditions for forest health, as they did early on with the Dragon Bravo Fire, which was ignited by lightning on July 4. In social media posts and public statements at the time, the National Park Service said it was using what it called a "confine and contain strategy."</p> <p>But when the weather shifted a week later, historically dry and windy conditions caused the fire to blow up. It destroyed the century-old Grand Canyon Lodge perched on the North Rim along with employee housing and more than 100 park structures. Arizona's elected leaders quickly called for investigations, but some say they are still waiting for answers.</p>
<p>"At this point, we have not received any information or any response that makes us think that they're even really fully grasping what occurred and how it occurred," says Arizona Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego.</p> <p>In July he and Democratic Senator Mark Kelly wrote a letter to Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum demanding answers about management of the fire. Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona has also requested more information and Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs has called for an independent investigation.</p> <p>"The administration and the National Park Service really needs to answer what happened so we could potentially stop this from happening in the future," says Gallego.</p>
<p>Since the lodge burned, Park Service officials have said they intended to fully suppress the Dragon Bravo Fire from the start. And even though it is now all but extinguished, fire managers still have not declared it fully contained. In all, it has burned 145,000 acres and has cost nearly $130 million to fight.</p> <p>The Park Service would not agree to an interview for this story.</p> <p>But in an emailed statement, Grand Canyon National Park Public Affairs Officer Joëlle Baird said, "An interagency review team will be delegated the task to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the fire's management and operational response. These national-level reviews are thorough and can take months to complete."</p>

<div class="article-title">Supreme Court allows Trump to fire -- for now -- remaining Democrat on FTC</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>In an emergency order Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed President Trump to fire Rebecca Slaughter, the last remaining Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission. The court's action is technically temporary, since the justices said they will hear arguments in the case in December, but every indication is that the conservative court majority will use the case to reverse a major Supreme Court precedent that dates back almost a century.</p> <p>Congress created the FTC and lots of other agencies to be multi-member, bipartisan regulatory agencies. And the Supreme Court in 1935 upheld those statutes ruling ruled against then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt's claim that he could fire FTC commissioners at will. In a unanimous opinion at the time, the court said Congress acted within its powers in declaring that a commissioner could only be fired for misconduct — not for a policy disagreement.</p>
<p>But now, prodded by President Trump, the court's six-member conservative majority seems poised to remake the way independent agencies operate. And if the handwriting on the wall is as clear as it seems to be, the independent agencies won't be independent. Their membership will be subject to the will of the president.</p> <p>The court's action Monday was hardly subtle. While the lower courts had ruled that the president could not fire Slaughter, under the court's 1935 precedent, the conservative Supreme Court majority allowed the president to fire her. Indeed, her name isn't even on the FTC website anymore. And the court so far has allowed Trump to fire other agency board members. In short, the justices are not playing hide-the-ball. And it's a good bet that the court will reverse the 1935 precedent, which until now had been reaffirmed multiple times.</p> <p>The result will be that whereas in the past, these agencies had to be bipartisan, with a minority of opposition party members, now there will be no such requirement. In short, Trump can name all the agency members. And if his successor is a Democrat, he or she can fire all the Republicans.</p> <p>Since  Trump's appointment of three ultra-conservative justices, the Supreme Court's conservative majority has been edging ever closer to reversing the way independent agencies operate. The court's conservatives believe in a so-called unitary executive, meaning that the president <em>is</em> the executive branch, as Chief Justice John Roberts put it in granting Trump significant immunity from prosecution even when he was out of office.</p>
<p>The only exception to what likely will be a major legal tsunami may be the Federal Reserve Board. In an unsigned order earlier this term, the court so far at least seemed to think that the Fed is different because it was established by Congress 112 years ago to stabilize and modernize the banking industry and to set interest rates. But whether that will hold, is anyone's guess.</p> <p>Dissenting from Monday's order, Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the court's three liberal justices, said that Congress created the FTC and other independent agencies to ensure they would be bipartisan. </p> <p>"The majority may be raring to change the law passed by congress nearly a century ago," she said. "But our emergency docket, should not be used, as it has been here, to transfer government authority from Congress to the President and thus to reshape the nation's separation of powers."</p>

<div class="article-title">When will fall foliage peak near you? Here are some leaf-peeping predictions</div>
<div class="article-source">NPR News</div>
<html><body><div><div class="storytext storylocation linkLocation" id="storytext">
<p>It's officially fall in the Northern Hemisphere, which means bright, beautiful foliage isn't far behind.</p> <p>Parts of the U.S. will soon start to see — if they haven't already — leaves and shrubs trade their green hues for vibrant shades of orange, yellow and red as the days get shorter and temperatures get chillier.</p> <p>"It's a really cool process that we get to watch, that trees are preparing for winter," says Alexandra Kosiba, extension assistant professor of forestry at the University of Vermont.</p>
<p>Trees shed their leaves in order to store and recycle valuable nutrients (in their trunks and branches) before winter's ice and snow can rip them off. As temperatures drop, chlorophyll — the pigment that makes leaves appear green — starts breaking down, revealing the yellows and oranges they've had all along.</p> <p>Leaves typically start to change color in the northernmost states by mid-September, peaking around the end of the month and later farther south.</p> <p>This year, <em>Almanac</em> predicts that leaves in northern areas of the West and Midwest will peak by Oct. 4, while much of New England and the Pacific Northwest will be at or near peak fall color by Oct. 11, followed by the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p> <p>Multiple fall foliage maps — including from Explore Fall, TheSmokyMountains.com and Almanac — do their best to estimate when leaves will change and colors will peak across the country, a helpful resource for leaf-peepers and autumn enthusiasts hoping to make the most of the season.</p>
<p>But projecting peak foliage isn't an exact science. The timing and onset of the color change vary by location, based on factors like temperature, elevation, rainfall and pests.</p> <p>"No one can predict fall foliage — we just have to sort of let it unfold," Kosiba says. "We can use research and monitoring to inform what we think is going to happen, but it's really this incredibly unique process that happens, and we get to experience it."</p>
<p>Kosiba says online trackers can be helpful for understanding long-term patterns, though they don't capture local nuances. She recommends that people monitor updates from their state's forest health agency for real-time observations in their area — and prepare to do a little local exploring this fall, even if they're not planning a full-fledged fall road trip.</p> <p>"If you're in a location … and it's looking a little dull, go a little further afield, go to a different location, and you might find some really good fall foliage developed," she says.</p> <h3 class="edTag">Climate change is delaying color change</h3>
<p>Researchers have found that weather conditions in previous seasons can also affect the timing and intensity of leaf color changes.</p> <p>A tree's recent past can dictate how vibrant or muted its leaves are in the fall. And, in a colorful contradiction, warmer spring temperatures can trigger trees to start the fall foliage process earlier, while warmer fall temperatures can delay the onset of color changes.</p> <p>"In general, we are seeing fall foliage is occurring later than it has historically, based on global climate change," Kosiba says. "But every year can be really different depending on the spring, summer and fall conditions that occur."</p>
<p>Kosiba says that climate change has delayed fall foliage by about a week since experts started monitoring it in the mid-20th century — around the time that "leaf-peeping" entered the modern lexicon.</p> <p>These days, fall foliage-related tourism generates some $8 billion in New England annually, according to the National Park Service, with visitors flocking to towns, mountain ranges and national parks to take in the views.</p> <p>Peak foliage usually lasts seven to 10 days, according to <em>Almanac</em>, though weather conditions can make a big difference. Kosiba says wind and heavy rain can cut a fall foliage season short, while the idyllic combination of warm, sunny days and cool nights can significantly prolong it.</p>
<h3 class="edTag">Making the most of peak foliage </h3>
<p>New England is currently experiencing drought conditions — despite a wet spring and early summer — which is causing leaves in some places to turn brown and shrivel up.</p> <p>But in other cases, Kosiba says, minor drought can actually make some leaves turn an even deeper red.</p> <p>Kosiba says parts of New England, like where she is in Vermont, are seeing the onset of fall foliage about a week earlier than expected. But the region's varied topography and rainfall patterns make it hard to paint with a broad brush.</p> <p>"So we'll see in some places, where the soil is very shallow and rocky, that we are seeing early leaf drop," she says. "And then on the other side of a hill very close to that location, we might see an area that's really green and hasn't even started the fall foliage process."</p>
<p>If you're worried about missing peak Northeast foliage, or planning a last-minute leaf-peeping trip, Kosiba's advice is "just keep driving south." Southern New England and parts of the Mid-Atlantic may not see their colors peak until late October or even November.</p> <p>"My thought personally, because I love the fall foliage season, is that it's always good somewhere," she says. "So if it seems a little brown where you are, go a little bit to a different location."</p> <p>Even if you're staying local, there are a few tricks you can try to get a more colorful view. Kosiba recommends going to a higher elevation, especially if you're in a dry place. Wetlands can be a great place to look for fall foliage, especially for deep reds. And don't forget to look down.</p> <p>"We often think of fall foliage on trees, but a lot of our shrubs in our forests, even our ferns, turn really nice colors," she says, mentioning blueberry shrubs, viburnums and understory plants, a category that includes ferns and mosses. "There's usually something good to see somewhere."</p>
